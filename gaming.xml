Top-ranked former world champion Magnus Carlsen recently showed up to a tournament in jeans, refused to change, got fined, and then threatened to back out of the event altogether. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) then proceeded to blink first.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The drama kicked off on December 27 when Carlsen showed up to the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York wearing denim instead of slacks. FIDE said the chess world all-star was in violation of the event’s dress code and hit him with a $200 fine. When Carlsen refused to go pick up dress pants from the TJ Maxx just a block away from the Cipriani Wall Street venue, the federation upped the ante and removed the champion from his 9th round matchups.</p><p>Carlsen then called the federation’s bluff by saying he would back out altogether, ditching the Blitz Chess Championships in which he was set to defend his current title. The federation responded with a lengthy blog post announcing possible exceptions to the dress code to be made at the judges’ discretion. </p><p>“The principle is simple: it is still required to follow the official dress-code, but elegant minor deviations (that may, in particular, include appropriate jeans matching the jacket) are allowed,” the December 29 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fide.com/news/3366&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fide.com/news/3366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement read</a></span>. “In the end, it is New Year time, and I sincerely hope that nobody would try to undermine the festive mood, including by abusing this additional flexibility.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5T4w5bEz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview directly after the incident</a></span>, Carlsen said that he had come to the event from a meeting and hadn’t had time to change. He added that while he had offered to change for the matches the following day, that wasn’t enough for the federation. “I’ll probably head off to somewhere where the weather is a bit nicer than here,” he quipped. But now that FIDE has backed off of its “draconian” decision, Carlsen is once again set to appear in the Blitz side of the tournament. </p><p>The five-time world champion wasn’t the only one dinged over his attire. Eighth-ranked Ian Nepomniachtchi was also fined by FIDE for wearing “sport shoes.” But Carlsen’s protest certainly made for more drama. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hans-niemann-magnus-carlsen-cheating-scandal-lawsuit-1849684477">Hans Neimann</a></span>, who Carlsen previously accused of cheating in chess’ now-infamous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chess-champion-anal-bead-magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-1849542639">“anal beads” scandal</a></span>, said the champion had manufactured the jeans fiasco on purpose. </p><p>“Allowing a single actor to make a mockery of the tournament and then bending the knee is disappointing,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1873549360862232682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “FIDE has a responsibility to protect the sanctity of the game.

<p>Stardew Valley has hit another sales milestone. According to the game’s developer ConcernedApe, the game has sold over 41 million copies as of December 2024.</p>



<p>That total puts it roughly 11 million more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-30-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “over 30 million”</a> it surpassed earlier 2024. According to the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, 26 million of the 41 million copies have been sold on PC while another 7.9 million were sold on Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>Released in 2016, Stardew Valley was a solo-developed game that has continued to see major updates nearly nine years later. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-stardew-valley-console-update-is-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last major update</a> — 1.6 — saw new festivals and events added along with hundreds of other changes.</p>



<p>In addition to game updates, the game continues to hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-hits-all-time-player-count-eight-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new player count records</a>. Even the music has found its place in the hearts of players with <a href="https://www.stardewvalleyconcert.com/news/new-tour-announcement-sos-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a full orchestra tour</a> performing the game’s soundtrack. Lastly, a recent study found that Stardew Valley was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-best-game-reducing-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best game for reducing stress</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-2025-outline-pvp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Focus Entertainment has shared what's coming to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>shooter in 2025, and if you're a fan of the PvP game modes, you'll be pleased with the roadmap.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/135-december-community-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">December community update</a>, Focus first looks at the last few months for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, highlighting things like major updates and the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow">rather impressive sales figures</a>.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 recap, Focus then moves onto highlighting what you can expect from next year in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and the first thing on the agenda is more PvP content. The publisher says it knows PvP fans feel "left out", and so next year will bring a new map, custom lobbies, and more.</p>

New Operations and enemies are also on the way for you to tackle.</p>

<p>We also got a look at the next champion making his way to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, and it's a Salamander sniper. Focus acknowledges that the Raven Guard Chapter would have been "an obvious choice" for a sniper, but that the studio has "different plans" for the Raven Guard.</p>

<p>More customization options are also coming, alongside a new Datavault option on the Battle Barge. It'll allow you to read "unlockable information on most elements from the game", in case you want to brush up on your&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>lore.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, it's a third-person shooter set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>The game sees protagonist Demetrian Titus returning from the first game. Having spent time with the Deathwatch in order to prove himself free of heresy, Titus is re-inducted into the Ultramarines and tasked with eradicating a Tyrannid infestation on the planet Kadaku.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes both close-quarters combat and ranged weaponry, and it's also got a renewed focus on co-op play. Fittingly enough, its credits also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-credits-totalbiscuit" rel="nofollow">feature a rather touching tribute</a> to a man who championed the original title.</p>

In other words, if you’re playing the shooter on a high-end PC that can run the game at a higher framerate, you’ll find your enemies will take more damage from certain attacks than they would if you were playing on a machine that runs the game at a lower framerate. Other idiosyncrasies include certain attacks executing more quickly, or seemingly losing range at lower framerates. The reason some fans are calling this “pay to win” is because if you can afford a beefier PC, you can circumvent the issue entirely.</p><p>Currently, this bug is known to impact five characters: Star-Lord, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Magik, and Spider-Man. At the moment, this is a bigger problem for players on PC than on console, as those all play at the same framerate across the board. However, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is crossplay, which means you could be teamed up with a PC player affected by this, so it’s a problem for everyone until it’s fixed.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>has received a few patches that have primarily focused on bug fixes, so that seems to be top of mind for the team. Now that this issue has been discovered, hopefully NetEase will be looking into a fix.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2025.1071366/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m starting to feel like Charlie Brown from The Peanuts comics, and Microsoft is the Lucy who keeps pulling the football away right as I go to kick it. Every year I write this feature, and every year I say that this looks like The Year™ where everything comes together for Xbox. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2024"><u>Last year</u></a>, in fact, I specifically said, “Looking ahead to 2024, that positive momentum looks set to continue and, with any luck, snowball.” Microsoft arguably didn’t live up to that for the first 10.5 months of the year, with only the visually-full-but-gameplay-empty Hellblade 2 dropping in May after many years of waiting. But to the big-spending publisher’s credit, it did end the year extremely strong, dropping three exclusive bangers in a row: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>STALKER 2</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review"><u>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</u></a>, and my personal vote for Game of the Year in 2024 and the game that I think is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/indiana-jones-is-the-best-xbox-exclusive-in-years-unlocked-671"><u>the best Xbox exclusive in years</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review"><u>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, can Microsoft keep that positive end-of-2024 momentum going into 2025? Call me Charlie Brown if you must, but yes, I genuinely believe that 2025 could be Xbox’s strongest and most bountiful year since at least 2021, when it dropped Forza Horizon 5, Halo Infinite, and Psychonauts 2. Let’s dig into why I’m optimistic…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Fountain of Fantasy and Firearms</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox’s 2025 kicks off rather quickly and, from everything we can tell, rather impressively with Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG Avowed, due to be released on February 18. This “Skyrim Lite” is set in the studio’s established and well-loved Pillars of Eternity universe, it’s supposed to be around the same meaty-but-not-gargantuan 25-40 hours long as Obsidian’s most recent first-person RPG The Outer Worlds, and it’s impressed us more and more every single time we’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-we-finally-played-obsidians-first-person-rpg-and-its-fantastic"><u>played it</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-the-final-preview"><u>quite recently</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, while it doesn’t have a firm release date yet, id Software’s unexpected zag of a prequel, Doom: The Dark Ages, is almost a lock for 2025. In fact, I’d wager an In-N-Out Burger lunch that it drops in the first half of the year for two reasons: 1) Doom Eternal shipped in March of 2020, meaning that in just a few months, it will have been a full half-decade since the last Doom (which itself followed four years after Doom [2016]). In other words, it’s time! Particularly since the idTech engine is already firmly in place despite the jump to a new console generation. And 2) I’d bet <em>another </em>In-N-Out lunch that the long- and eagerly anticipated reboot of Fable being cooked up at Playground Games – which, remember, got tagged with a 2025 release window in its Xbox Showcase 2024 trailer – is going to be Xbox’s big Fall/holiday game at the end of the year. That means Doom probably ships before the holidays. But whenever it does – and remember that it’s already confirmed to be a multiplatform release on day one – it’s probably going to kick some serious ass for Xbox next year, judging by how good id Software’s last two Doom games have been.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Fable: in my opinion, the revival of Fable has higher potential – both critically and commercially – than almost anything else in Xbox’s portfolio short of Call of Duty, The Elder Scrolls, and Fallout. We’ve seen Playground’s take on the British-charm-tinged action-adventure-RPG a few times now, and each time it’s been crystal clear that not only does Playground “get” Fable (it’s British itself, which no doubt helps), but that the game looks absolutely incredible as well. Who knew that the ForzaTech engine could render a jaw-droppingly beautiful fantasy forest just as well as a racetrack? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s one other huge reason to be optimistic about Fable, and that’s Playground’s track record. Simply put, this studio has not only never missed, it’s never made anything less than a consensus 9 out of 10. Its last game, the aforementioned Forza Horizon 5, was IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u>2021 Game of the Year</u></a>. And it clearly is being given plenty of time to cook, as Fable was formally announced in 2020 with work having already been done prior to that. Microsoft knows it can’t fumble Fable a second time, and I couldn’t be more excited about what has been shown so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, while it certainly isn’t nearly as big a name as Fable, we can’t forget about South of Midnight, the third-person action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games that’s leaning heavy into the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore"><u>folklore of the bayous of the Deep South</u></a>. This one’s nothing like the developer’s past games, which is admittedly riskier but also more intriguing. Microsoft has tabbed this one for 2025, so consider South of Midnight as something of a wild card for next year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another smaller-name Xbox exclusive that I think everyone will be talking about if it comes together when it finally ships in 2025 is Replaced. It’s a pixel-art, cyberpunk-styled side-scrolling action-adventure game that oozes style and, as I discovered when I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/replaceds-beautiful-design-leaves-us-wanting-more-ign-live-2024"><u>played</u></a> it over the summer, is much deeper than I expected. Replaced has the potential to join the long list of legendary Xbox-exclusive indies that includes games like Limbo, Braid, and Inside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, don’t forget about Xbox’s actual biggest franchise (since they now own it), Call of Duty. It’ll stay on PlayStation, of course, but Xbox fans will get it day one on Game Pass. The 2025 Call of Duty is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030"><u>rumored to be a future-set Black Ops 2 sequel</u></a>, so perhaps Treyarch is handling the campaign on this one after Raven Software did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>stellar job</u></a> on this year’s Black Ops 6 campaign. And the other, much quieter juggernaut in the Xbox portfolio, Minecraft, will probably get <em>some </em>kind of big in-game content, what with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-latest-trailer-reveals-steves-origin-story"><u>the Minecraft movie on the way</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What About Hardware?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Barring a 180 from Xbox boss Phil Spencer’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reiterates-there-is-no-need-for-a-mid-generation-refresh-for-xbox-series-xs-right-now"><u>previous comments</u></a>, Microsoft won’t be pushing a mid-gen upgrade to the Xbox Series X (an Xbox Series XX, if you will) in 2025, if ever. And though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away"><u>a handheld Xbox is in development</u></a>, we’re unlikely to play it or even see it in the coming year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So should we expect any new hardware in 2025? Probably not – at least in terms of raw horsepower. The Xbox Series S got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-with-1tb-ssd-in-carbon-black-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase"><u>storage upgrade</u></a> in 2024, as did the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-all-digital-edition-officially-announced-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Series X</u></a>. And we’ll no doubt see a bevy of new special-edition controllers and maybe even that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-leak-reveals-potential-one-hand-controller-mobile-controller-more"><u>upgraded controller codenamed Sebile</u></a> mentioned in the FTC leaks from over a year ago, but 2025 does not appear to be the year for Xbox to drop any new silicon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Anything Else?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare’s Everwild appears to be in limbo and/or development hell, as we haven’t seen or heard from it in years. Might it reemerge in 2025? Maybe, but I’m not holding my breath. Meanwhile, Halo is being reset at the studio level, which in my opinion means the next Halo game is likely to either be a reboot of the franchise altogether or a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved. Either way, it’s going to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>built in Unreal Engine 5</u></a>, and it’s probably going to take a while. InXile’s steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wasteland-developer-inxile-unveils-clockwork-revolution"><u>announced</u></a> in 2023 with a release window of “coming in due time.” The Outer Worlds 2 has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-announced-xbox-e3-2021-summer-of-gaming"><u>revealed</u></a>, and we now know it is coming in 2025, so that means Obsidian plans to ship <em>two </em>first-person RPGs in the same year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And speaking of first-person RPGs, will that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>rumored Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster</u></a> actually happen? How about Contraband, from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios, which was in the 2021 Xbox Showcase and hasn’t been seen or heard from since? All we know is that it’s “a co-op smugglers' paradise set in the fictional world of 1970s Bayan.” Should it reemerge in 2025, it’s unlikely that it also ships next year as well, given the usual PR/marketing cycles on big-budget games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild card for 2025 is Double Fine, the endlessly creative and versatile studio headed by game design legend Tim Schafer that is coming off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-nominations-announced"><u>2021 Game Awards Game of the Year nominee</u></a> Psychonauts 2. I’d expect Schafer and the studio to announce their new project soon, but as to whether it actually comes out in the next 12 months is anybody’s guess. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Games to Play on Xbox Series X|S</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, anything from this year’s Xbox Showcase that didn’t have a release year at the end of the trailer can safely be assumed to be a 2026 (or later) release. That means I’m not reasonably expecting to play Gears of War: E-Day, Perfect Dark, or State of Decay 3 in the next year. And that’s OK! It finally feels like Xbox is starting to pump out not just a steady stream of first-party games, but a consistently <em>good </em>stream of them. This is what Xbox has been building towards since they first started acquiring studios in 2018 to try and fix their first-party games problem, and dammit I think this is the year they finally do it. Please don’t pull that football away from me again, Lucy-Microsoft.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/30/game-of-the-year-2024-biggest-disappointments/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Whether you buy into the awards season or not, it’s an ideal opportunity to reflect on the past twelve months; for the most part we’ve been highlighting the very best games of 2024, but it hasn’t all been sunshine and lollipops. It’s been another year of breakout hits and exciting announcements, brought down by some pretty major flops and worrying wider trends.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, really. If last year’s layoffs weren’t devastating enough for the industry, 2024 took things to the next level with thousands more workers losing their jobs without an end in site. Game developers around the globe have been forced to downsize, merge, or close their doors for good with high profile casualties including Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks</a> (thankfully <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">rescued a few months later by Krafton</a>) and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin</a>, as well as myriad smaller studios and indies.</p>

<p>From rising development costs and changes in consumer habits to the post-pandemic lurch, the video game business is still ludicrously lucrative, but money is pooling around a smaller number of key pillars of gaming than before, making big bets increasingly risky.</p>

<p>The job losses have been catastrophic, resulting in countless workers leaving the games industry for good, the ensuing instability no doubt warding off a generation of up-and-coming talent in the process. It’s not just those who create your favourite games either, it’s those who report on them with a large number of media outlets either been scaled back or shut down completely, displacing an untold number of journalists.</p>
<h2>Concord – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>There was one pretty big omission from the previous section: the closure of Sony’s Firewalk Studios and the embarrassing eradication of its one and only game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a>. The writing was on the wall though we didn’t expect things to pan out quite so disastrously for everyone involved.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Sony, like every major publisher, has been wanting a larger slice of the live service pie for a long time now. However, arriving so late to the party with Concord – long after Overwatch, Fortnite, and Warzone – the remaining crumbs were little to sustain a modest multiplayer title, let alone an ambitious new IP with a hulking AAA budget. It didn’t matter how strong the core gameplay was, there just wasn’t enough interest. And instead of dangling a roadmap in front of players and relying on them to occasionally splurge on a neat skin or battle pass as Warner Bros. did with the year’s other huge flop, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad</a>, Sony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">axed the game within weeks of its big launch</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">closed the studio a couple months later</a>.</p>
<p>After a recent winning streak, this comes as a real blow to the PlayStation brand and is sure to have a ripple effect on other multiplayer projects Sony had in the pipeline, as well as its willingness to invest in new IP.</p>
<h2>Toxic Gamers – Also Disappointing</h2>
<p>Toxicity has always been an issue in gaming. However, where it was once limited to multiplayer trash-talking and forum board trolling, it has become a industry within itself. A machine fuelled by blind hatred and misinformation, piloted by talentless husks who try to make a living from inciting “anti-woke” rage while never creating anything of value themselves. The mere presence of minority representation or, God forbid, a modestly clothed female protagonist, is met with senseless vitriol.</p>
<p>It’s a sickening trend that has made online gaming spaces less and less habitable by folks with a reasonable brain cell count and always begs the questions – why are people, particularly grown men, getting so upset about entertainment products? The second-hand embarrassment is almost unbearable.</p>

			<p>At the moment, the reason behind these hacks is unknown, but clearly, it's so that they can get their hands on the valuable resources that can help you to become powerful in the late game. Path of Exile 2 finally made its way into <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Early Access after being highly anticipated</a> by those who are fans of the cRPG genre. However, it seems that those who are in the late game have logged on to find that their accounts have been compromised, with highly valuable resources missing from their stash and their inventories. Since inventories are shared between characters, this allows for easier leveling of any other classes that the player may try out. To lose such valuable items is a huge, devastating loss, as a lot of them require a ton of grinding to be able to obtain them in the first place.</p>
<p>Most shockingly, it seems that the hackers managed to make it past Steam 2FA without a bat of an eye. Some of those who were affected have said that they received an email from someone trying to get into their account, but somehow, they still managed to slide past the Steam 2FA anyway. If it's that easy to do, it means that Steam will likely have a bigger problem than just what is currently going on with Path of Exile 2.</p>
<p>People are sharing their stories on the<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3667200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official Path of Exile forums</a>, where they share how they found out that their accounts had been compromised. It doesn't spell good news for those who were impacted, as Grinding Gear Games has said that they are unable to roll back the materials that were stolen by other players, basically leaving players to grind for the materials all over again, with hours of gameplay lost to a hacker.</p>
<p>It's reported that the hacker is known on the forums, as he would share updates as he was going. However, he would continuously change his username, making it hard to keep track of him. Whether there were more people involved remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn't just impacting Path of Exile 2. Even those who are still playing the original Path of Exile are finding their resources impacted, with tons of Gems and other valuable resources completely missing from their account. As a result of the hack, some players are finding that their accounts have now been banned, and they have lost access to the game.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games is tackling this and is working to resolve the bans on accounts that were impacted, but it's said that this process can take weeks to deal with, meaning that players won't have access to their Path of Exile 2 accounts for the unforeseeable.</p>
<p>If you've been hacked, please let us know your story in the comments.</p>

Historically, Sonic’s one-sided love affair with the pink, hammer-wielding hedgehog has consisted of Amy fawning over the blue blur. He’s fast, charming, and a hero to the people. It’s easy to see why Amy would grow infatuated with a guy who saved her life but is emotionally unavailable. However, the <em>Sonic</em> series has started to flip the dynamic in recent years. The <em>Sonic Boom </em>version of our hero is implied to have feelings for Amy, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@captaintoadthemushroom/video/7303124575229938976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@captaintoadthemushroom/video/7303124575229938976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mostly through gags and teasing</a></span> from his friends. And in <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, Sonic is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBIH0j3UyLE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBIH0j3UyLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more or less confirmed</a></span> to have finally come around to the idea of a romantic relationship with Amy, so we’ve definitely moved out of the “Amy hopelessly chasing Sonic” era of their dynamic. With Sega having mostly shed this lopsided relationship, Paramount has the opportunity to turn the entire thing on its head in the live-action universe.</p><p>We still don’t know anything about Amy’s role in the movies, but we do know that Ben Schwartz’s take on Sonic is defined largely by him being a pop-culture-brained doofus prone to bursts of emotion, often in the name of defending those he cares about. As shown in the first movie, he’s been in isolation for much of his life, and he’s not quite the smooth talker we’ve seen in the games. Hell, I’m not even sure Sonic has ever spoken to a woman hedgehog based on what we’ve seen of him in the movies. He was forced to leave his home planet and go to Earth at a young age, and he was the only hedgehog we saw in those early scenes. You expect me to believe that guy is gonna be anything other than an absolute dumbass tripping over himself trying to sort through all those feelings? Amy, meanwhile, is shown to be confident and capable in the few seconds we see of her, rather than the damsel in distress she started as in the games. This seems like the perfect opportunity to play with the relationship, and fans are already hoping to see the two’s romantic story flipped on its head.</p><p>What’s notable about Amy’s debut in the movies is that it’s a direct inverse of her introduction in the games. When Amy was first brought into the fold in <em>Sonic CD</em>, Sonic saved her from his robot doppelganger, Metal Sonic. In <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene, she is the one who saves him from a squad of robot hedgehogs. So it seems like Paramount is already sowing the seeds for a “reverse” Sonic and Amy relationship. Still, we won’t know for sure until <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em> premieres in 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>These days, it seems like every protagonist is edgy and serious--with maybe the exception of cartoon mascots--across movies, games, TV, and wherever else you can imagine. Leave it to the Like a Dragon game series, which is essentially a playable Japanese-crime soap opera when you get down to it, to rethink that idea. Ichiban Kasuga is a refreshing, powerful antithesis to that, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth put his optimistic, unironic outlook on the world to the test--one he passes with flying colors.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Warning: We'll be discussing some spoilers from very early and very late in the game. This picture of Ichiban is your chance to back out now.</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414286" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414286-like-a-dragon-iw-03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like a Dragon: Yakuza introduced us to Ichiban for the first time. As a longtime fan of the series, I was initially suspicious. I wondered, who's this guy? Who's this goofy-looking dork with hair like he bit down too hard on a live wire?</p><p dir="ltr">He quickly won me and many other Yakuza fans over quickly with his enthusiasm and seemingly bottomless well of optimism that he can pull from whenever he or someone he cares about seems to be cornered.</p><p dir="ltr">It was Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, though, that really cemented him as the new protagonist of this series. Sure, Like a Dragon: Yakuza had its share of drama, but Infinite Wealth put him through the wringer. He meets his first party member, Tomizawa, when Tomizawa takes him to a back alley of Honolulu to scam him. Then he meets his second, Chitose, when she drugs him and leaves him naked on a public beach (with only the most rudimentary command of English, too). After those early-game betrayals, he goes through bunches more, including the discovery that one of his warmest recent friendships was a ruse by the person who engineered Ichiban being fired from his job in disgrace.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414287" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414287-like-a-dragon-iw-04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the final moments of the game, though, Ichiban tracks that man down and convinces him to turn himself in to the cops. Ichiban carries the guy through Kamurocho to the police station, even as people huck trash at them the whole way.</p><p dir="ltr">The game opens on Ichiban trying to help ex-yakuza find legitimate jobs, and ends with him trying to rehabilitate someone who literally tried to destroy every bit of his life, and even those of his friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Kiryu will always be my favorite protagonist, but the way Ichiban plays reflects the difference in their approaches. Kiryu is kind of a time traveler, acting like the yakuza depicted in old crime movies. His missions are often about helping people, but they're often framed more like life lessons. For Ichiban, though, every chance to help someone is like a chance to cannonball off a diving board; he rushes into it against his own best interests and is immediately all-in. He trusts first and forgives quickly. It makes him seem naive at times, as we see in the opening hours of the game. But what it becomes is a rallying point for everyone around him. He's naive, yes, but he's also confident, brave, and reliable, and it's a virus that begins to infect all of the people around him who had been pushed out of society in different way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414288" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414288-like-a-dragon-iw-05-jacked-danny-trejo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Throughout Infinite Wealth, you build relationships with each of your party members, and when you stop by the watering hole they all chill at after a hard day of questing, you have the chance to take that relationship to the next level (no, not like that) by listening to them vent about their own rough histories, and then helping them overcome them.</p><p dir="ltr">Kiryu spends games trying to honorably isolate himself from everyone he knows and loves, seeing his presence as a curse on their lives--that the drama coming around them is entirely his fault. Ichiban is the opposite, though, as he works overtime to unite everyone around him.</p><p dir="ltr">So many games put you in the shoes of grimdark or tortured people--Alan Wake, Spider-Man 2's version of Peter Parker, Space Marine 2's Captain Titus, FFVII's Cloud, James Sunderland of Silent Hill 2, to name a few recent examples. Some of my favorite game characters are among that list, but even so, Ichiban continues to stand out as special in modern gaming: a video game hero who's excited to be there, ready to get a team together, and take on all challengers without ever coming across as trite, false, or annoying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR issues will be fixed in the near future, according to one of the game's developers.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-ps5-pro-upgrades-are-more-substantial-than-you-may-think">Digital Foundry</a>, the game's Principal Rendering Engineer Michal Drobot confirmed that the game's PSSR issues, which include white flickering pixels appearing in certain scenarios and smearing issues with ultra-fine details, will be addressed very soon, as fixes for these issues are already in the pipeline and will be rolled out soon once the relevant patch goes through QA. Reportedly, these issues are caused by PSSR not being fine-tuned for denoising the image in its current state, and, as such, works better in anti-aliasing the image but not denoising the flicker created by shadows, variable rate shading, and SSR.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will soon be fixed on PlayStation 5 Pro, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at how the development team improved the game on the system over the base model and how the engine was improved for the latest entry in the series. You can find the full analysis below.</p>

<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>

<p>PlayStation isn’t giving up on live service games any time soon. In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst said that the company still believes in the model despite recent hiccups like Concord.</p>



<p>“The game business is constantly changing due to various factors, including technological advances, new genres and ways of playing,” Hulst said via auto translation. “However, one thing that remains constant is people’s desire for great entertainment experiences, and attention to games continues to grow. However, this has also created competition, and like many companies in the industry, we have had to make changes to our business to solidify a more sustainable operating base.”</p>



<p>Hulst continued by saying PlayStation will “continue to focus on developing live service titles along with the story-driven single-player titles that our players want.”</p>







<p>As far as why a  continued effort towards live service games, Hulst pointed to Helldivers 2’s success as a reason. The co-op title from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Game Studios showed how</a> a live service game can succeed in the modern era, and it’s something that Sony and PlayStation are paying attention to.</p>



<p>“We are learning a lot as we establish the ability to develop high-quality live service titles within SIE,” he said.&nbsp;“Helldivers 2 attracted many players through continuous content provision, and achieved results that support the potential of live service titles.”</p>



<p>What do you think of PlayStation moving forward with more live service games? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/item-shop-management-sim-recettear-is-getting-an-hd-remaster-next-year.1071294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EasyGameStation has announced&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>, a remastered version of the cult classic 2007 item shop management sim that's coming next year.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about the project. In <a href="https://x.com/Recettear_EGS/status/1873564667366506965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on social media platform X (for which we're using machine translation), EasyGameStation simply says "we will open an item shop again in 2025", ending the post with the hashtag #RecettearHD.</p>

<p>Given the project's name, we're assuming it's not a ground-up remake of the game, but rather a remastered version for modern systems. Presumably, that also means we'll be seeing it on consoles, although it's difficult to say at this early stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=RTTQRLD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-dungeon.jpg?itok=5v_BVVSw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots released so far for the game include a shot of Recette standing in her item shop, as well as an adventurer exploring a dungeon and battling slimes.</p>

<p>In the first shot, we can see controller glyphs that somewhat resemble those of the Nintendo Switch, although all we've got to go on right now are an "A" and a "Y", which could also easily refer to Xbox controller glyphs.</p>

<p>We also don't yet know whether this version of the game will be localized outside of Japan, although one social media post seems to suggest that this will indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Andrew Dice, the founder of&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>localization studio Carpe Fulgur, noted&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/SpaceDrakeCF/status/1873584405652062392" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on X</a>, promising more info "in the year to come". If Carpe Fulgur is involved, then it's very likely we will be seeing&nbsp;<em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>in the West.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=iq_StUKf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-hd-remaster-2025-shop.jpg?itok=wPFfYfby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>looks like it'll be coming to the West, and probably to consoles as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, it's an item shop management sim-slash-dungeon crawler along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">is itself getting a sequel next year</a>), although it's much more light-hearted and satirical than Digital Sun's game.</p>

<p><em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>revolves around Recette Lemongrass, a girl who must pay back a loan on behalf of her father by running an item shop. She must haggle with customers, send adventurers out on epic quests to retrieve loot, and generally deal with the vagaries of JRPG capitalism.</p>

<p><em>Recettear HD&nbsp;</em>lands sometime next year, although we don't know when or where yet. The original version is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's currently up for grabs at a tidy discount as well.</p>

The first trailer also teases the show’s different timeline in which Osborne, who is normally the Green Goblin, is the technological visionary standing by Spider-Man’s side instead of Stark’s Iron Man. It ends with a first look at the web-slinger’s white and black Fantastic Four suit as well. </p><p>Parker is voiced by Hudson Thomas, Osborne by Colman Domingo, and Aunt May by Kari Wahlgreen, with appearances by Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock, Hugh Dancy’s Doctor Octopus, and other members of the <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting cast. Originally pitched as an origin story for Tom Holland’s version of the character in the MCU, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em> is now its own thing, free from the shackles of the live-action productions’ deep and convoluted lore. </p><p>The trailer nails the fusion of modern sensibilities with retro-looking styles, though its lithograph-inspired animation isn’t impressing everyone. Some fans think it looks too choppy and flat. Others are wondering if it’s a budget issue or if this was the intended effect. It certainly doesn’t look smooth, but the comic-book aesthetic comes with its own virtues.</p><p> There are already plenty of <em>Spider-Man</em> cartoons in more traditional styles, so I’m excited to see something that’s taking a fresh visual approach to the well-worn source material.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stardew-valley-sales-have-now-passed-the-40m-mark.1071276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-sales-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Smash hit indie farming sim&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is somehow continuing its meteoric ascent despite the fact that it's almost nine years old, at least if its latest sales figures are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on the official <i>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</i>site's <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press portal</a>, Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone says that the game has managed to shift a staggering 41 million copies "as of December 2024".</p>

<p>According to Barone, more than 26 million of those copies have been sold on PC alone, while 7.9 million copies have been sold on the Nintendo Switch. The game's success being primarily PC-based makes a lot of sense given that that's the first platform on which it was released.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-farm.jpg?itok=epDSYwLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-farm.jpg?itok=-w6Y-sJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has officially passed the 40 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>It didn't take&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>very long to begin its journey to success. Just a couple of months after the game's initial launch, it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-breaks-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>, hitting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-1-on-switch-eshop-over-35m-owners-on-steam" rel="nofollow">3.5 million players on Steam alone</a> in January 2018.</p>

<p>Even on mobile platforms, where free-to-play games reign supreme and upfront paid products often struggle,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-ios-version-crosses-1-million-in-sales-on-itunes" rel="nofollow">managed to rake in $1 million</a> in sales on iOS within just a few weeks of its launch on the app store.</p>

<p>It's clear that&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>has struck a chord to an even greater degree than other cozy farming sims; it arguably spearheaded the current wave of such games, especially in the indie sphere, so its success makes a lot of sense through that lens.</p>

<p>The game, which is heavily inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) franchise, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harvest-moon-creator-on-his-new-game-and-how-stard/1100-6445583/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">attracted praise</a> from that franchise's creator Yasuhiro Wada, who said&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>"carries on the legacy of the original&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>very well".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=ZE5YXRQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-sales-40m-sign.jpg?itok=N9wkuq20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's no wonder Eric Barone is taking his time with his next game.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what Barone is working on next, he's currently developing a new cozy life sim-style game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game's development is progressing slowly, largely because Barone is still working on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, which he describes as a "big and popular game" to which he has "a lot of attachment".</p>

<p>He also says that&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>will "still take a while", but that following the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>1.6 release on all platforms, he "<a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would like to finish&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>next</a>".</p>

<p>Here's hoping that happens sooner rather than later. Until then,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stardew-valley/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/stardew-valley/C3D891Z6TNQM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/stardew-valley-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile platforms.</p>

			<p>The adventure games genre is usually a bit neglected by studios compared to more mainstream genres like action, roleplaying, and shooter. However, this year saw several great releases from indie and triple-A developers alike. Without further ado, let's dive into our shortlist for the best adventure game of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a></em></p>

<h2>Indika</h2>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the year in the genre is undoubtedly Indika, the game developed by studio Odd Meter and published by 11 bit studios. In this game, set in the early 1800s in an alternate version of Russia, players step into the role of a young nun slowly adjusting to the harsh life of a convent. That's just the tip of the iceberg of her troubles, though, as Indika also somehow speaks with the Devil himself, who leads her on a journey of self-discovery that goes beyond the convent both physically and metaphorically. The game also features unique puzzle elements and 2D pixel art mini-games, as if its peculiar rendition of Russia wasn't already enticing enough.</p>
<p>Following its debut on PC, Indika recently launched on consoles, too, receiving widespread acclaim from fans and critics. It can be purchased for a 25% discount right now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Riven_Key_Art_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Riven</h2>
<p>Old-school gamers probably need no introduction to Riven. For everyone else, this is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riven-unreal-engine-5-remake-to-launch-this-year-on-pc-with-vr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the cult classic second entry in the Myst series</a>. Following the release of the full remake of Myst, Cyan Worlds has prepared the same treatment for Riven, delivering a full 3D landscape remade in gorgeous Unreal Engine 5 and expanded with new puzzles and a deeper story. Virtual Reality users can immerse themselves even more fully into this mysterious island.</p>
<p>As a founding member among adventure games of the puzzle subgenre, it's great to see the Riven remake doing so well. Fans are now wondering whether Myst III: Exile will be next. Meanwhile, if you've yet to check it out, Riven can now be purchased at a 30% discount.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nobody-wants-to-die.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Nobody Wants to Die</h2>
<p>The other big surprise of 2024 came from Critical Hit Games, which released <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobody-wants-to-die-developers-release-10-minute-exclusive-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Wants to Die</a> (published by PLAION) in the middle of July. Not exactly the best period to launch games, but this interactive story (think Quantic Dream's style) still managed to find its own niche.</p>
<p>The protagonist is Detective James Karra, and the story is set in a future (2329) version of New York City massively influenced by noir and cyberpunk settings. There's a serial killer on the loose who has been targeting upper class citizens. To complicate matters, Nobody Wants to Die takes a cue from the likes of Altered Carbon - here, too, the wealthy can afford to transfer their consciousness into new bodies to attain a sort of immortality. Karra also has his own tech gizmos to help him in the investigation, such as a time-manipulation augmentation that lets him review what happened at the crime scenes.</p>
<p>Nobody Wants to Die is currently 30% off on Steam.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dustborn_keyart_layered_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dustborn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dustborn-a-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Norwegian developer Red Thread Games has been a staple of our Best Adventure Games series over the years, thanks to releases like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dreamfall-chapters-two-fates-bound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamfall Chapters</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/draugen-full-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draugen</a>. Dustborn took longer to develop than the others, to be sure, but the result was quite worth the wait, according to reviewer Amy Eastland.</p>
<p><em>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</em></p>
<p>If you're into the concept of a road trip with friends across a dystopic USA where you play in a punk-rock band and also fight baddies with words, Dustborn is currently 60% off.</p>
<h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p>2024 saved the best for last, as they say. With Lara Croft and Nathan Drake missing from the gaming market, MachineGames brought back the man who inspired those characters - Indiana Jones - in style with their newly released Great Circle. The game admittedly features quite a bit of action, but it still fits more with the adventure genre, as it relies a lot more on puzzle solving, exploration, and non-lethal solutions to disagreements. Here's the final excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>The game is highly successful so far, having already <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatched</a> a Game of the Year award from the Gamescom community, and Disney is reportedly very much open to greenlighting new Indiana Jones adventures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-martyn-brown-dies-57<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown has passed away aged just 57. He worked with the publisher for two decades, helping to oversee the release of games like&nbsp;<em>Worms</em>,&nbsp;<em>Alien Breed</em>, and the PSP remake of&nbsp;<em>Lemmings</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/team17-co-founder-martyn-brown-dies-aged-57" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz report</a>, Brown's son Jack confirmed his death following "a prolonged battle with a series of strokes". Jack says Brown passed "on his own terms listening to his favorite music and surrounded by loved ones".</p>

<p>GI.biz points to a number of emotional tributes from other folks in the gaming industry, including one from Riot Games' EMEA publishing director Hannes Seifert, who somberly declares that "the light of our generation of developers is slowly but steadily dimming".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-martyn-brown-dies-worms.jpg?itok=14rQ4uXI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-martyn-brown-dies-worms.jpg?itok=oi1aCyJN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team17 is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>series, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Brown's untimely death comes just a month after he <a href="https://gamerepublic.net/awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">received an award</a> from gaming body Game Republic.</p>

<p>The Games Legend award is reserved for industry figures who've had a major impact on the gaming world, with previous winners including the likes of Revolution Software's Charles Cecil and Noirin Carmody.</p>

<p>Indeed, Game Republic managing director Jamie Sefton was one of the industry figures paying tribute to Brown, calling him "such a friendly, funny person" and describing him as an "industry legend not just for Team17 but also for his incredible support and help" for other devs and gaming figures.</p>

<p>Brown co-founded Team17 in 1990 as a merger between two pre-existing companies: British studio 17-Bit Software and Swedish outfit Team 7. His co-founders include Debbie Bestwick, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-ceo-to-step-down-after-over-30-years" rel="nofollow">stepped down</a> as Team17 CEO earlier this year following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-employees-allege-harassment-terrible-pay-and-more" rel="nofollow">allegations of a poor work culture</a> by employees.</p>

<p>As GI.biz says, he's survived by his wife Heather, as well as his children Jack and Harry and his stepdaughter Darcy.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-ps5-games-in-2024.1071261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24322806/ps5-best-games-2024-playstation-sony<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It’s been a bit of a rough year for PlayStation exclusives and the studios that make them. While <em>The Final Shape</em> was generally lauded as an excellent concluding chapter to <em>Destiny 2</em>’s current story arc, Bungie was faced with all kinds of setbacks including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210476/bungie-to-layoff-220-employees-new-project">canceled projects and layoffs</a>. Elsewhere, Sony’s Firewalk Studios <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">launched <em>Concord</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">unlaunched it</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">then closed permanently</a> within the space of a few months after the hero shooter failed to gain traction in a glutted market.</p><p>That said, PlayStation still came through this year with a slate of excellent games that will hopefully demonstrate that there’s an appetite for more than just live-service shooters.&nbsp;</p><p><h3><em>Helldivers 2</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em></a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on"><em>Foamstars</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em></a>, <em>Concord</em> — 2024 has been littered with the bones of live-service shooters that came, went, or are limping along with little fanfare and even fewer players. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a><em> </em>was something special. It could be the game’s humorous over-the-top take on political propaganda, the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios fully leaning into the bit, or the regular content updates including the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320131/helldrivers">Omens of Tyranny update</a> that launched in early December. But <em>Helldivers 2</em> managed to be the one live-service multiplayer shooter this year (that doesn’t have <em>Call of Duty</em> in the title) that has the juice to compete against the big forever games like <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><h3><em>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</em></h3></p><p>FromSoftware has managed to keep the <em>Elden Ring</em> party going with the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. The DLC is massive, stuffed with ass-beating enemies and so much delicious lore, all taking place over a map that is much bigger than what director Hidetaka Miyazaki called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">the size of Limgrave</a>.” Truly, <em>Erdtree</em> feels more like a straight-up sequel to <em>Elden Ring</em> than a mere expansion of it — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320097/elden-ring-sequel-nightreign-the-game-awards-trailer">which is probably what <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a><em> </em>is.</p><p><h3><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h3></p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> took 10 years and a bunch of strife at BioWare to launch.&nbsp;There was no guarantee that it would live up to the reputation the series has established — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc">but it did</a>. <em>Veilguard</em> is exemplary of the<em> Dragon Age</em> series’ strengths: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review">characters you come to care for and choices that devastate both them and you</a>. Layered on top of that is a seriously detailed skill tree with a loot system that feels strangely like a <em>Diablo</em> game. <em>Veilguard</em>’s combat empowers you to customize your class to a level of specificity I’ve never seen in a <em>Dragon Age</em> game before, making it an interesting iteration of the standard warrior, rogue, mage RPG system. There was a concern that <em>Veilguard</em> would be overshadowed by last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23818692/baldurs-gate-3-starting-guide-tips-how-to"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, and while <em>Veilguard</em> doesn’t seem to have that kind of runaway success, I’m pleased as hell that, in two years, I got two wonderful, life-absorbing RPGs.</p><p><h3><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a> continues Square Enix’s attempt at adapting one of the greatest RPGs of all time to suit modern consoles and gaming audiences. This second entry in the great <em>FFVII </em>trilogy project takes over as the gang escapes Midgar into the wider world, and damn what a wide world it was. Every aspect from the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has been expanded and fully fleshed out, either with more story or with a fancy new minigame. Speaking of minigames, <em>Rebirth</em> is less about the events of <em>FFVII</em> Disk 2 and more a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081238/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-queens-blood-triple-triad"><em>Queen’s Blood</em> delivery system</a>, proving that Square Enix is really just a collectible card game developer in disguise.</p><p><h3><em>Silent Hill 2</em></h3></p><p>Remaking a classic game is always a tricky thing. A developer needs to attempt to capture what made the original so beloved, while also updating it for new audiences. And that conflict is especially fraught when you’re dealing with a genre-defining game like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>. But Bloober Team did a surprisingly solid job with this remake, ensuring that the idiosyncratic survival horror experience looked and felt at home on modern platforms, while still retaining most of the scares and tone of the original. The remake is a little cleaner than the PS2 game it’s based on, but it’s also less frustrating to play. And most importantly, it still mostly nails those foggy vibes.</p><p><h3><em>Astro Bot</em></h3></p><p>There’s never been a game I’ve instantly clicked with more than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>. Going back to my first demo with the game at Summer Game Fest 2024, I knew this had something special. <em>Astro Bot</em> is a well-crafted platformer that has players traveling through the galaxy to find the scattered pieces of a PS5 spaceship and its stranded crewmates. Though it pays tribute to the games of PlayStation’s 30-year history and features really neat homages to their gameplay, <em>Astro Bot </em>is also a love letter to joy. Every aspect of its design — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243763/astro-bot-sound-design-dualsense-controller">from its music to its sound effects to its bright and cheerful graphics </a>— is a reminder that there is still so much love in the world that aches to be discovered. <em>Astro Bot </em>was my game of the year from the second I rolled credits, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/12/24320203/astro-bot-is-the-2024-game-of-the-year">its GOTY win at this year’s Game Awards</a> was richly deserved.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
