			<p>Xbox has been struggling recently when it comes to finances, as its consoles aren't selling as well as the company had hoped. As a result, they have started pushing their software and subscription services more. Despite that, they made several changes to the subscription costs of Xbox Game Pass, which led to a lot of outrage from people in the gaming community as the prices increased. The price wasn't just adjusted in one country, but the price for Game Pass Ultimate, Core, and PC Game Pass were all increased, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">the cost of Game Pass Ultimate increasing</a> from $16 to $19.99 for a monthly subscription. Despite their price increases, their finances still weren't looking great. It's been confirmed in the <a href="https://x.com/bdsams/status/1851715686017699940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft FY25 Q1 (July-September) report</a> that Activision has been heavily pulling the weight for them.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition of Activision, Xbox's gaming revenue has grown by 43%, with all of the gaming revenue coming specifically from Activision. Additionally, Xbox content and services revenue grew by 61%, with 53 points of net impact being from the Activision acquisition. While it wasn't specified in the report, it's assumed that the growth comes from Game Pass. This would be expected, as some of Activision's games are making an appearance on the subscription service for the first time. This is the first time that people who use the subscription service will be able to play a Call of Duty game via Game Pass, as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was added to the service as a day-one release. Additionally, users will have access to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone.</p>
<p>Also mentioned in the report is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/">Xbox hardware</a> revenue has declined 29% year-on-year, which was expected. Microsoft hasn't worked on releasing any new console compared to their competitors, who have openly expressed that they are working on new consoles, with Sony even releasing the PlayStation 5 Pro. Whether Xbox plans on making another console seems to be up in the air at the moment, but it has been hinted at in the past that the next console to come will be "<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">making a huge technological leap</a>," as reported by Sarah Bond. It's also been teased that they are looking into making a handheld console, but again, nothing has been confirmed by the company.</p>
<p>Overall, Xbox's finances seem to be balancing back out a little bit, but it's obvious that without Activision they would be in deep water, as Activision is carrying their finances significantly with major releases such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

But hardware revenues again declined, down 29 percent this quarter, which may be influenced by Microsoft’s continued strategy to make its games available <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073286/xbox-console-exclusivity-hardware-update-game-pass">more widely than just Xbox consoles</a>.</p><p>During the quarter, Microsoft introduced its new Xbox Game Pass “Standard” tier and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">price hike</a> for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Q1 also saw the arrival of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24195537/call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-modern-warfare-3">on Xbox Game Pass</a>, but this quarter doesn’t include the impact of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173669/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-october-25th">launched last week</a>.</p><p>The company’s Intelligent Cloud division was also a bright spot, with total revenues up 20 percent year over year to $24.1 billion driven by Azure. Azure and other cloud services revenue was up 33 percent, “including 12 points” from demand for its AI services. Productivity and Business Processes, which includes its Office products, was up 12 percent year over year to $28.3 billion in revenues. </p><p>Microsoft’s OEM and Devices revenue — which are now reported together — were up 2 percent. However, that figure was driven by “growth in Windows OEM” and “partially offset by a decline in Devices,” Microsoft says.</p><p>Microsoft, like many other companies, is investing heavily in AI-focused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246010/microsoft-copilot-pages-multiplayer-ai-business">features and tools</a> right now, especially to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254032/microsoft-copilot-news-presenter-notepad">improve Copilot</a>. “AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process,” Satya Nadella, chair and CEO of Microsoft, says in a statement. “We are expanding our opportunity and winning new customers as we help them apply our AI platforms and tools to drive new growth and operating leverage.”</p><div><p>The company has also made security its top priority and released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251945/microsoft-security-report-secure-future-initiative">a report in Q1 about its efforts</a>. During the quarter, Microsoft also had to grapple with the effects of the Blue Screens of Death caused by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/20/24202527/crowdstrike-microsoft-windows-bsod-outage">the massive CrowdStrike outage</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-firewalk-what-playstation-can-learn-from-this-failure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of console domination, we’re starting to see cracks in the PlayStation brand as it tries to brute force its way towards live-service supremacy. There’s no clearer example of this than the high-profile failure of Concord and the closing of Firewalk Studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, PlayStation announced that it was shuttering Firewalk Studio, a  developer founded in 2018 that Sony acquired just last year. The reason for the acquisition and the closure are the same: Concord, a live-service PvP hero shooter released on both PS5 and PC, developed by creatives who cut their teeth on games like Destiny and Call of Duty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be perfectly frank, Concord bombed. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB data</u></a>, player counts on PC  never broke 1000, and estimated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sales figures</u></a> across both PS5 and Steam were abysmal. At the time of its disastrous launch, I laid out reasons <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">why Concord failed</a> to land, including the eight years it spent in development that caused it to completely miss the hero shooter trend that was kickstarted by  Team Fortress 2 in 2007 and peaked with Overwatch in 2016: </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>“Knowing the cost and development time required for a AAA online games, studios have to assess, predict and/or simply guess as to what will be the next big hit. What games will succeed in four, five, six years time if we begin developing it right now? Will the audience still care for that kind of game when we’re finally ready to release it? It practically requires the services of a fortune-teller to get the answer right.”</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, if you start making a game based on what’s popular now, you’re probably already too late.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The reason for the acquisition and the closure are the same: Concord</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That quite straightforward mistake is compounded by Concord’s exorbitant development cost. The vast budget that allowed for PlayStation’s characteristic best-in-class visuals and a library of cinematic cutscenes we’ll never see meant that while rivals were released free-to-play, Sony chose to sell the game for $40. Combined with low consumer awareness and tons of quality, free alternatives, Concord’s price put it at a massive — and, as it turns out, fatal — disadvantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content wise, it’s hard to say that Concord was fully baked when it launched. The character kits were awkward at best, the systems — which Firewalk said mixes elements of fighting games and card games — were mostly unclear, and the map designs had much to be desired. Parts of the internet will say that Concord’s characters also doomed the game. Though this is a hard argument to believe considering Valve’s own hero shooter, Deadlock, was released at around the same time to widespread excitement and an exploding player count. And Deadlock doesn’t even have a finalized character roster, though it is free-to-play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all this is to say that Concord is a black eye on the PlayStation brand, and not just because of its commercial failure. Sony’s handling the entire situation has been catastrophic. It’s one thing to release a flop, but pulling the game from stores and player accounts barely weeks after launch, and <em>then</em> shutting down the studio it just acquired and scattering its developers into the wilds of 2024’s already miserable games industry, are the panicked decisions of a company totally unsure of where to go next.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Trailer Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This kind of failure and subsequent panic is alien to modern Sony. Since the launch of the PlayStation 4, its gaming brand has been nearly unstoppable, releasing critically-acclaimed game after game and defeating its rivals in the console race. Nintendo has all but exited the console wars, choosing instead to be everyone’s second console of choice, while Xbox has spent years rebuilding itself in an attempt to get close to being second place again. But while games the platform’s signature single-player games like God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man, and The Last of Us racked up awards and sales, the game industry changed. Industry analysts like <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/most-gamers-prefer-single-player-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIDiA </a>may say that most gamers prefer single-player games, but the truth is that in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamers-mostly-played-older-games-like-gta-5-and-fortnite-in-2023">80% of game time was spent on just 66 games,</a> most of which are online games such as Fortnite, Minecraft, Call of Duty, and League of Legends. Live-service is where the attention and dollars are at.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not hard to see why Sony would be interested in pursuing an aggressive live-service games strategy, then, beyond just the potential profits. PlayStation’s first-party teams like Naughty Dog and Insomniac spend nearly half a decade developing their AAA single-player games before they’re released. So, if Sony has a few live-service games to keep players distracted in between major AAA releases, then suddenly it’s got a pretty healthy looking release calendar that alternates between single-player game releases and live-service content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was probably with this in mind that Sony acquired Destiny 2 developer Bungie in 2022, its most high-profile live-service studio acquisition to date. That wasn’t all; at the time Sony announced that it planned to have 10 live-service games running by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. Last year, seemingly in response to a behind-the-scenes realization of how difficult a goal that was to achieve, Sony revised that number down to just six. With the shuttering of Concord and numerous rounds of layoffs at Bungie, it’s clear that the PlayStation live-service era is off to a rocky start. So what can Sony do about it?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First, it’s important to understand the current state of play and where Sony’s at in its live-service goals. PlayStation has canceled numerous online games, some officially confirmed, others only known via rumors and reports. Among them are  Naughty Dogs’ The Last of Us PvP project, an online Spider-Man game, a live-service Twisted Metal, and Payback, a third-person Destiny spinoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the projects still reportedly in development, there’s Bungie’s Marathon (which just received an official developer update and, for the moment, seems safe) as well as two rumored Horizon games – one a co-op experience, the other an MMO. Sony also acquired Haven Studios in 2023, a new game studio started by former Ubisoft veteran Jade Raymond. While Haven was purchased for its own upcoming AAA PvP project, Fairgames, Sony also planned for the studio to help bolster its other live-service efforts – until its closing, Haven aided Firewalk in development of Concord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Sony’s most successful contribution to the live-service genre is via a studio it doesn’t actually own. Arrowhead Studio’s massively successful Helldivers 2, may show the PlayStation Studios logo when it boots up, but it is only published by Sony. And, while it launched to great fanfare, Helldivers’ recent updates have been less well-received by the community, further indicating the long-term challenges PlayStation faces in the live-service arena.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s not hard to see why Sony would be interested in pursuing an aggressive live-service games strategy, beyond just the potential profits. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategy here is muddled at best. The Last of Us and Spider-Man are both incredibly popular games for Sony, but to not even try to deliver on a multiplayer component when that’s such a big focus for PlayStation this generation feels like a missed opportunity. Meanwhile, Sony is also willing to release games from new studios like Firewalk for $40 in a genre dominated by premium, free-to-play experiences is a huge gamble, unless Sony believes that the PlayStation brand is strong enough to bolster the very first game from a relatively unknown studio. And without even giving Concord time at making any kind of meaningful change after the launch, Sony shutters the studio outright. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its official <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">statement</a>, Sony says it will “take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.” But with so much having gone wrong for Concord, it feels like Sony should look at everything it did with Concord and do the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe don’t be so arrogant as to believe that the PlayStation name alone is enough to prop up a game in an over-saturated genre. And if a live-service game fails to meet its targets a week after launch, maybe don’t immediately pull it from stores. And, for any prospective developer in talks to join the PlayStation family, maybe assure them that they won’t be shut down the moment after their first game isn’t a hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <p>
If you were thinking of slapping one of your old PlayStation 5 faceplates on your shiny new PS5 Pro when it launches on 7th November, Sony has some bad news for you; the company has now confirmed there's no compatibility between the two.
</p>
<p>
Word of a faceplate mismatch - not exactly unexpected given the PS5 Pro's slightly thinner form factor compared to the original PS5 - first surfaced earlier today when a Reddit user (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-plates-wont-work-on-ps5-pro-sony-says-updated-covers-will-be-available-in-the-future">IGN</a>) shared the news after having "an opportunity to try the plates on" the new machine.
</p>
<p>
"I had some Cobalt blue plates so I decided to try them out on the Pro," user Zrorro <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1gfr6ot/playstation_5_pro_does_not_work_with_the_slim/">wrote</a>, "and I can confirm the bottom plates match the Slim. However the top plates do not match because while they're physically the same size, the teeth that connect to the system are and slightly different places. So you can't connect the top part."
</p>

<p>
"I'm only telling you all this," they added, "so y'all know and don't bother ordering plates for the Slim to use on the Pro."
</p>
<p>
And now, Sony has confirmed the news, telling IGN, "PS5 console covers are not compatible with PS5 Pro." The company did note, however, that "players will be able to swap out different console covers for PS5 Pro when they become available in the future". So there you go; goodbye old, beloved faceplates, hello fresh selection of £45+ PS5 Pro-specific ones.
</p><p>
PlayStation 5 Pro will, of course, cost £699.99 when it launches on 7th November (so a reluctance to spend more on brand-new faceplates would be understandable), and if you're wondering whether it's worth it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Digital Foundry recently had a chance to go hands-on</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-the-launch-of-infinity-n5.1023621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the baren planet Shinju, 2 forces stand on the precipice of battle. An elite force of JSA, who consider the planet part of their territory, stands ready to defend against a PanOceania colonial force, with both ready to move to violence to achieve their aims. This is Operation Sandtrap, the launch box for <em>Infinity N5</em>. In this article, we'll look inside the Operation Sandtrap box, and at the forces it contains, discuss who it's for, and look at how to start your <em>Infinity</em> journey with N5 if you're a new player.</p>

<p>I'm hugely excited for Operation Sandtrap and <em>Infinity N5</em>. Those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 and I've been playing <em>Infinity</em> and the JSA ever since. <em>N5</em> has the JSA moving from a non-aligned army sectorial force to a full Infinity faction with their own sectorials (specialist army lists).</p>




<h2>What Are Infinity N4, N5 And Infinity CodeOne?</h2>

<p>For those new to <em>Infinity</em>, the N version of the game (<em>N3, N4, N5</em>) states which edition of the rules are being used. The latest and current edition of the rules,&nbsp;<em>N5,</em> is due to be released in full, for free, online on 18 November 2024 and will be available in the <a href="https://infinityuniverse.com/resources">official website downloads section</a>. <em>Infinity CodeOne</em> was N4's slimmer version of the <em>Infinity</em> rules, which also contained more streamlined army lists. <em>Infinity N5</em> is moving away from <em>CodeOne</em> and one of the next <em>Infinity N5</em> release is <em>Infinity Essentials</em>, which will contain the Quick Start rules and 6 miniatures (3 PanO and 3 JSA) that will supplement those in the Sandtrap box, along with printed versions of the stat cards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-2.jpg?itok=QF3PxkZY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-2.jpg?itok=AnO2DibK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Where Are The Infinity Rules?</h2>

<p>The Operation Sandtrap box doesn't include any rules or stats for the miniatures it contains (previous 2-player battle boxes included beginner rules and stat profiles for its miniatures). All the rules and stats will be available for free online when released on November 18, but it does mean that if you get hold of a box early, you will only be able to use the Quick-Start rules (essentially a demo for <em>N5</em>) or use the Sandtrap profiles in <em>N4</em> until the <em>N5</em> rules are released. The upcoming <em>Infinity Essentials</em> box will include a printed copy of the <em>N5</em> Quick Start rules, and stat cards for the 6 miniatures, this is to make it easier for those brand new to <em>Infinity</em> to start playing straight away, expanding into Sandtrap and the full <em>N5</em> rules after.</p>

<h2>What Are The Core Mechanics Of Infinity?</h2>

<p>For those new to <em>Infinity</em> it has 2 core mechanics that set it apart from other systems. The order pool and Automatic Reaction Orders (ARO). Each turn, every unit still standing in your force provides an order token. Order tokens are spent to activate your units during your turn and can be allocated to units as you choose. For example, if you have 10 orders, they can all be spent to activate a single unit 10 times or split between different units. This gives a lot of flexibility each turn and you can prioritize a goal, and spend orders until it’s achieved.</p>

<p>Automatic Reaction Orders are actions you take during your opponent's turn. They allow units to react to actions made by the enemy, like dodging an attack or shooting in response to an enemy attack or movement. This makes turns very dynamic, and you have to be aware of your opponent’s possible reactions to your actions. If your units move out of cover, which enemy units will be able to fire at them? If you fire at an enemy, will they be able to return effective fire?</p>

<p>Skill tests are taken on 20-sided dice (D20s), and require rolling under the attribute being tested. If the enemy reacts to your action, it changes the roll to a face-to-face roll, which means you have to roll under your attribute, but above the enemy's roll to succeed.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-3.jpg?itok=wIk0uEte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-3.jpg?itok=R6hYPhQg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Does Infinity Operation Sandtrap Contain?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above,&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Operation Sandtrap doesn't include any rules or profiles for the forces it contains, which makes it feel like an <em>N5</em> launch box for veteran <em>Infinity</em> players, especially as the 2 included forces are brand-new Sectorials, which are specialist army lists, with access to limited units (as opposed to the core faction list, known as Vanilla lists), but they get access to Fireteams, which allow you to link up individual troops into a unit to get access to new abilities and boosted stats. It is perfectly possible to use the Sandtrap box with the Quick-Start rules (using the miniatures in Sandtrap in place of those detailed in the tutorial) and then move into the full <em>N5</em> rules using the forces as normal should a beginner want to start with this box.</p>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Operation Sandtrap box contains:</p>

<ul><li>14x Miniatures (we discuss both forces in detail below)</li>
	<li>1x double-sided printed Akashi Site cardboard scenery set and game mat</li>
	<li>6x faction-themed 20-sided Dice (3 for PanOceania and 3 for JSA)</li>
	<li>Cardboard markers, templates, and measuring tools</li>
</ul><h2>What Forces Does Operation Sandtrap Contain?</h2>

<p>Operation Standtrap includes the start of 2 brand new Sectorial armies for Infinity N5. The Shindenbutai for the JSA (who now become a full faction of their own, moving out of being a Non-Aigned Army), and the Kestrel Colonial Force for PanOceania.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-4.jpg?itok=XKU7pBOE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-4.jpg?itok=8mpCCJeO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Shindenbutai force contains:</p>

<ul><li>3x Senku&nbsp;- The core line troopers for the Shindenutai. They come armed with Combi-Rifles and CC weapons, along with&nbsp;a profile option with the&nbsp;forward observer skill that allows them to target enemies to make it easier for the rest of the force to hit.</li>
	<li>1x Raiden - This support trooper is armed with a missile launcher and has hidden deployment and surprise attack. Their purpose is to lay down fire to allow your close combat fighters to advance. Once revealed, they have a decent armor value and&nbsp;Mimetism which makes them harder to hit, to protect them from return fire.</li>
	<li>1x Jizamurai - The Jizamurai are part-time samurai, carrying out their normal colonist duties until called upon to don their armor for battle. They're very solid close combat troops, with high armor and&nbsp;Mimetism to protect them as they close the distance. They have an average movement and only 1 wound, so you will need to be careful when advancing them across the battlefield.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1x Hatamoto - The Hatamoto are full samurai, and their profile shows it. They're faster than their Jizamarai counterparts, with slightly lower armor, but a nanoscreen to help them move up to engage in close combat, where they excel.</li>
	<li>1x Nokizaru - These are a specialist group of ninjas, and they excel in all areas. Armed with a shock-close combat weapon, they are great if they can close with their enemies. The Sandtrap miniature&nbsp;is armed with a&nbsp;MULTI Marksman Rifle, which gives you options when you're choosing your target, and a killer hacking device for offensive hacking options.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-5.jpg?itok=s1XmZS1y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-5.jpg?itok=-1nBTs7S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Kestrel Colonial Force force contains:</p>

<ul><li>3x Fennec Fusiliers - Armed like the Senku line troopers with Combi-Rifles, they're slightly more expensive, but come lightly armored. They have a lower close combat skill, but higher ballistic skill, and one of the profiles comes with Paramedic to help to keep the rest of your force&nbsp;on the battlefield.</li>
	<li>1x Griffin - These heavily armored and armed (the Sandtrap profile&nbsp;comes with a&nbsp;high damage, high rate of fire HMG) troops also carry a Multispectral Visor L1, which limits the effectiveness of Mimetism.</li>
	<li>1x Banshee -&nbsp; A drop trooper armed with short-ranged weaponry, a light shotgun, and a +1 Blast template weapon Pulzar. They also have light armor and super jump to keep them alive and mobile.</li>
	<li>1x Scarecrow - The Scarecrow is an incredible infiltrator, with hidden deployment and Mimetism -6 and light armor to help keep them alive. They only have 1 wound and short-ranged weapons, so be careful when they make their move, as they're sure to attract return fire.</li>
	<li>1x Black AIR - This sniper comes armed with a&nbsp;MULTI Sniper Rifle, and a&nbsp;Multispectral Visor which reduces Mimetism bonuses to O, along with shooting through zero visibility zones. They also have light armor and Mimetism -3 themselves to reduce the effectiveness of incoming fire and allow them to threaten with AROs.</li>
</ul><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Infinity Operation Sandtrap?</h2>

<p>I absolutely love the 2 new Sectorial forces in Sandtrap, both play into their themes very well, with the close combat-focused Shindenbutai and the armored and ranged-focused Kestrel Colonial Force. It's hard to judge completely as we're waiting for the full <em>N5</em> rules to be released, but both factions seem very interesting, and I'm excited to see how JSA runs as a full vanilla faction, along with this brand new sectorial for them. The new miniatures in this box are incredible, both with their core aesthetic, and combined with packs, pouches, and gear for the desert operation.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-6.jpg?itok=0jC3KVd6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-operation-sandtrap-6.jpg?itok=iRsVh647 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Should I Buy Infinity Operation Sandtrap?</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a way into <em>Infinity</em> as a brand new player, then my advice would be to wait for the <em>Infinity Essentials</em> pack, which is designed for beginners, and is much smaller, not only to give you a taste of the game, but also of the 2 Operation Sandtrap factions. You can actually start playing <em>Infinity</em> by picking up the Action Pack for any of the factions that take your fancy, as all the rules (including the Quick Start rules from the Essentials box) and profiles are free online, so you don't need to necessarily start with a starter set. if you're a veteran player of either of the 2 included factions or if you want to start using either of those factions, then this is the place to pick them up until they're released separately. If you're a veteran player waiting for <em>N5</em>, then wait until the rules are released, and you'll be able to use your existing miniatures with the rules and profiles when they are released for free.</p>

A translated feedback sheet says that the design Game Freak had in the works too closely resembled fan mock-ups, which led to the team shelving the idea. Unfortunately, we don’t have any images of the flying fox at the moment.</p><p>That being said, the way fan artists were able to respond to the news by immediately whipping out their existing mock-ups of the hypothetical Eeveelution kind of suggests that Game Freak’s own ideas were likely being cannibalized by fan artists at the time, too. Eevee’s entire schtick is that it can evolve into one of several Pokémon, each with a different elemental affinity, so fans have been drawing mockups of possible Eevee evolutionary lines for decades, including flying-types.</p><p>Eevee is one of the most popular Pokémon in the franchise, having become a secondary mascot to the series alongside Pikachu. Eevee even got its own game in 2018’s <em>Let’s Go, Eevee! </em>on the Switch. It’s been a long time, however, since it got a new evolution, with the last being Sylveon, who debuted in 2013 as one of the introductions to the fairy typing that was added in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>. Whether or not Eevee needs more evolutions remains a topic of much debate among fans, with some content with the eight it already has, while others would like to see Eevee get a form for all 18 elemental types in the series. It sounds like Game Freak isn’t opposed to the idea, as long as it can find one that feels wholly original, and given how long people have been making fan art of fake Pokémon, that sounds like a difficult proposition. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">In 2021, Atari launched the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-VCS-800-Black-Walnut-Linux/dp/B08JPKKHCV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari VCS</a>, an interesting gaming console-PC hybrid capable of playing classic Atari titles and modern games. It also supported game and video streaming, internet browsing, and other general PC tasks thanks to its Linux-based OS. You can even customize the hardware thanks to an open M.2 SSD slot, upgradeable RAM, and support for different operating systems, including Windows.</p><p dir="ltr">The Atari VCS is admittedly a niche device that never really caught on, but if you're an Atari enthusiast or simply like tinkering with hardware, the Atari VCS is a cool throwback system with more versatility than your average mini-console. If you're interested in the console, you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-VCS-800-Black-Walnut-Linux/dp/B08JPKKHCV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pick up the Atari VCS All-In Bundle that's on sale for just $200 at Amazon</a></strong>, which saves you 50% off its original $400 price tag. This is the lowest price ever at Amazon; the VCS typically sells for around $300. The bundle includes the console, classic joystick wireless controller, and a modern-style wireless controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4391733-atarivcshero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391733" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4391733-atarivcshero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391733"></a><figcaption>Atari VCS All-in-One Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4391733-atarivcshero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Out of the box, the Atari VCS runs the Linux-based Atari OS, which includes 100 pre-installed Atari games and support for the Antstream retro gaming cloud streaming service. You can also stream games on Xbox Cloud Gaming, GeForce Now, Luna, and other game streaming services. Atari OS also supports video streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Plex, Twitch, and YouTube, plus the Chrome web browser.</p><p dir="ltr">The Atari VCS' AMD chipset is capable of decent game performance, especially for retro games and indies. However, if you want to expand the machine's usability, it can also run Windows, Linux Debian, and numerous other custom operating systems via a thumb drive, which you can use to download games and use apps that aren't native to the VCS. Atari sells a <a href="https://atari.com/products/usb-port?srsltid=AfmBOooG8mEm7qyt02arWKOIyNz2iVFmCL58Yj3rFRMAeTExjwAnWEaJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preconfigured flash drive</a> for Linux for $30. You can upgrade the console's 32GB flash storage via external USB drives and/or the open M.2 SSD slot. The VCS comes with 8GB RAM (two 4GB sticks), but you can upgrade it up to 32GB.</p><p dir="ltr">The VCS All-In includes a wireless joystick controller that's based on the classic Atari paddles, plus a standard wireless controller that resembles an Xbox controller. However, if you plan to play multiplayer games, you may want to grab an additional controller (or two). Both controllers are available for $40 at Amazon.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-Wireless-Modern-Controller-PC/dp/B08JPJGDWQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari VCS - Wireless Modern Controller</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-Wireless-Classic-Joystick-PC/dp/B08JPPTTF8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari VCS - Classic Wireless Controller</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Recent Atari Hardware</h2><p dir="ltr">The Atari VCS isn't the only new, official Atari hardware that has been released recently.

			<p>World of Warcraft: The War Within has been out for a little while now, and the next major update will be coming soon. The <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24152008/the-war-within-1107-content-update-on-the-ptr-october-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11.0.7 update</a> will be available on the PTR as of October 31, where players will be able to get their first glimpse at the new zone named Siren Isle. With the addition of Siren Isle comes a new currency called Flame Blessed Iron, which can be used to obtain new mounts, pets, gear, and transmogs. It will even allow players to get their hands on upgrades for a ring that they stumble across called Cyrce's Circlet. That's not all, as Flame Blessed Iron is also used to spawn in an event boss, which has the opportunity for more rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Siren Isle Preview | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbXcFW7g-o0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To give players a sneak peek into what they can expect from the upcoming zone, a new video has been released to showcase Siren Isle and explain the region in a bit more depth so players know what they can expect from the next major update for World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>In addition to the new zone coming to 11.0.7, players will get to participate in the Plunderstorm event once more. If you've ever wanted to be a swashbuckling pirate on the hunt for treasure, now is the perfect time. Keg Leg makes a return to Arathi Highlands, and you have to join the crew and fight to be the last pirate standing while making sure to grab as much loot as you can to get new and returning transmogs and mounts.</p>
<p>With this update comes more story, with players able to dive into the aftermath of the Dalaran explosion in the epilogue questline. This questline sees the Kirin Tor investigate their past mistakes and choose the path for their future. Additionally, there will be more story chapters for players to complete, where players will meet face-to-face with someone familiar in the darkness.</p>
<p>The Turbulent Timeways event will also be returning, where players will be given a chance to complete time walking dungeons from the previous expansions each week, which will provide the player with Heroic rewards and help them improve their item level, as well as get some gear to sell. Those who participate and manage to master the Timeways will be given the Timely Buzzbee Skyriding mount.</p>
<p>Finally, Humans and Kul Tiran will be given new Arathi ear customizations, which can be accessed by going to a Barber Shop, where you will be able to tweak your ear design to choose the new Arathi customizations.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-universe-turns-30-gets-anniversary-direct-on-november-13/">Warcraft 30th Anniversary</a> is 13 days away, where there will be even more announcements regarding World of Warcraft, as well as other games like Warcraft Rumble and Hearthstone.</p>

The game comes two years after Ubisoft’s failed bid <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23013346/ubisoft-ghost-recon-breakpoint-content-nft-digits-quartz">to make NFTs work in <em>Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</em></a>, a solid three years after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nft-sales-are-flatlining-11651552616">NFT prices and purchases fell off a cliff,</a> and barely a week after it announced it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277630/ubisoft-ends-future-development-on-its-best-game-in-years">disband the team</a> behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a>.</p></div><p>Surface level, <em>Champions Tactics</em> is a PC strategy game where players assemble teams of champions to fight their way up the rankings. Teams are composed of three champions, each with their own attributes and abilities that can exploit enemy teams’ weaknesses. At the beginning of each round, players roll dice to determine combat order. Next, they select abilities for their champions before combat plays out simultaneously. Rinse and repeat until one team is defeated. All in all, the game looks like a surprisingly decent, if generic, tactics game.</p><p>But then there’s all the NFT garbage. Champions are the game’s NFTs associated with the Oasys blockchain. To acquire champions you have to either forge them from existing champions you own or purchase them off the game’s marketplace. To purchase champions, you can either use the OAS cryptocurrency or plain ole cash money, with the cheapest going for about $7 and the most expensive sitting at an eye-watering $63,000 whole-ass American dollars. To understand what’s in it for Ubisoft to perpetrate this nonsense, the company takes a six percent “royalty fee” for every marketplace transaction, and there are about 2,700 active listings on the site.</p><p>But wait! There’s worse! Having more champions increases your VIP status. The higher your VIP status, the more experience points and in-game currency you earn, thus incentivizing players to spend money accumulating champions. To entice even more dollars out of customers, <em>Champions Tactics</em> also features an additional exclusive collection of NFTs to buy called warlords. According to the game’s website, owning a warlord unlocks access to “special events” and even more in-game boosts to earning EXP and gold. Players can use their warlords as their in-game profile pictures. Here’s what they look like.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Man, that sure is some compelling artwork selling for around $66.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div></div><p>Ubisoft is one of the biggest developers still apparently all-in on implementing blockchain technology within video games. In addition to trying and failing with NFTs in <em>Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</em>, last year, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954067/guess-what-revolutionary-new-blockchain-tech-ubisoft-has-cooking">a strategic partnership</a> with web3 gaming platform Immutable after reports of Ubisoft employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-11/ubisoft-employees-push-back-hard-on-blockchain-initiative">internally criticizing the company’s blockchain projects</a>. The tragedy is that <em>Champions Tactics </em>seems like it has decent mechanics that’d work just fine as a mobile gacha game. Purchasing champions and forging new ones seems perfectly suited to take advantage of the kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case">microtransaction activity</a> gaming companies salivate over. This game doesn’t need NFTs to make the kind of money Ubisoft is after. </p><p>But what’s worst of all is that Ubisoft spent money developing a game with features that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled">gamers</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23562296/gdc-2023-survey-microsoft-blizzard-activision-nft-unionization">and developers actively hate</a>, only to push it out to essentially die in obscurity mere days after it essentially said “No, thanks” to the people who made one of its best games in <em>years.</em> Yikes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a bunch of sales going right now on every imaginable storefront, it’s a great time to pick up a great horror game or two, and I think the <em>Oxenfree </em>games are a perfect one-two punch for the season. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192716" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="174" data-playlist="192716,196215,195670" data-current="192716"><div><p>Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18169.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As it so happens, the critically acclaimed narrative games from Night School Studio, including the seminal indie title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-the-kotaku-review-1753813513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-the-kotaku-review-1753813513"><em>Oxenfree</em></a></span> from 2016 and its 2023 sequel, are both heavily discounted on Steam right now. I’ve highlighted a number of shockingly low deals in my time doing this, but I don’t think I’ve ever spotted a deal as good as this one: <strong>both <em>Oxenfree </em>and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-night-school-netflix-1850628828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-night-school-netflix-1850628828"><em><strong>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</strong></em></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>will run you just $3 till November 4.</strong><br></p><p>Why is this such a steal? Besides the low low price of approximately three Arizona drinks, the <em>Oxenfree </em>games are just some of the most effective minimalist horror in the medium. At their simplest, they are 2D side-scrolling narrative games featuring branching dialogue options. But <em>Oxenfree </em>distinguishes itself with some exceptionally grounded writing, bringing to life its teenage and later young-adult casts as they unearth ghosts both real and imagined.<br></p><p>In the first game, a crew of teenagers goes to Edwards Island, a tourist trap off the coast of their hometown that’s also a famously “haunted” locale. On the night that Alex, her stepbrother Jonas, and the rest of their friends depart for the island, they start picking up weird radio signals and wavelengths that begin to open what can only be described as a schism between worlds. The angular portals that begin appearing around Edwards Island invite other kinds of beings into Alex’s reality, at which point the crew stops being able to discern reality from the tricks of otherworldly spirits.</p><p>I love intimate stories driven by characters rather than larger plot machinations. A good character study is one of the most enjoyable things a story can deliver, and that’s what <em>Oxenfree </em>really is. While both games are set against hauntings, possessions, historical tragedies, and even the goings-on of a cult, they <em>mostly </em>center on the unraveling of the leads, characters so tightly wound that they need ghosts to shake loose traumas that therapy could barely touch. Alex and her friends—as well as Riley and Jacob in the sequel—are each holding onto <em>a lot </em>before their fateful encounters, but they walk away from these experiences fundamentally changed, and as players who learn to love them, we hope, at least, that it’s for the better.<br></p><p>The oft-unspoken highlight of these games, though, is their runtime. The first game can be finished in about five hours, meaning that if you simply sit on your couch tonight and play it straight through to the end, you can be in bed at a completely reasonable time. That then sets the stage for you to enjoy the slightly bigger, and similarly ambitious, sequel (which clocks in at between 6-8 hours) tomorrow on Halloween. Remember when I called this pick-up a one-two punch? That’s what I meant.<br></p><p>For an even sweeter deal, you can <strong>pick up both <em>Oxenfree </em>games, the soundtrack to the first game, and even <em>Afterparty</em>, one of Night School’s more underrated titles about drinking your way out of Hell, for about $3. </strong>No matter how you slice it, this deal is out of this world.<br></p><p>Even if you don’t specifically enjoy these games just in time for Halloween, the fall is a notoriously spooky season. Make a weekend out of enjoying <em>Oxenfree</em>, that’s what I did when I played the first game! If you ever need a low-key and casual scary time, and you don’t want to watch a movie or show, why not pop on these two games? They’re as good as any season of TV, they’re relatively easy commitments, and they’re both incredibly thoughtful coming-of-age stories set at two completely different stages of life, because we’re always growing, we’re always learning, and more importantly, we’re all haunted by something. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is what makes their lack of explanation bewildering. It’s easy to have an inkling of what their purpose is, but figuring out how they work isn’t as simple. Here’s our breakdown of what each Battle Assist setting does and how to change them.</p><h2 id="h222052"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Adjust Battle Assist Settings</strong></h2><p><strong>You can freely toggle the various Battle Assist options by entering the Options Menu and then scrolling down to Accessibility.</strong> There are a lot of things to tinker with here, but a majority of them are different Assist features.

It’s available while browsing all the main menus, and even in the character select screen before entering training. Once you’re in an actual fight, you can’t access this menu and the associated settings anymore.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-recommend-id="image://520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan punches Majin Buu on the ground, with a blue aura surrounding him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan punches Majin Buu on the ground, with a blue aura surrounding him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-recommend-id="image://520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan punches Majin Buu on the ground, with a blue aura surrounding him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Performing combos can take a bit of knowhow in this game. You’ll need to string along different melee rush attacks (X/Square) and projectile Ki blasts (Y/Triangle) together. Using the same attack patterns will drop a combo, so you need to keep things fresh. Remembering what you haven’t used yet to keep the attacks coming can be surprisingly difficult at first. Though these basic combos are primarily just two buttons, it’s enough to create a sizeable difference in damage between those who know the systems and those who mash away.</p><p>From what I can tell, <strong>Combo Assist is supposed to help by outputting an ideal attack to keep the combo up.</strong> I believe it does this by switching between rush attacks and ki blasts for you. This is the only assist feature I don’t recommend using, since I could not consistently trigger it in my time of testing. Sometimes I could use one button to get a longer-than-usual combo out and at other times there was no difference. Attempting to trigger it by intentionally pressing the wrong button for a combo felt inconsistent as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-recommend-id="image://06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan uses a two-handed smash attack to launch Majin Buu towards the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan uses a two-handed smash attack to launch Majin Buu towards the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-recommend-id="image://06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan uses a two-handed smash attack to launch Majin Buu towards the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Many would think there aren’t many options after launching an opponent halfway across a map, but that isn’t the case in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>.

Being able to perform high-flying combos with just one button is awesome. On the flip side, I didn’t always agree with what the game thought was an appropriate follow-up.

Moving on the D-pad with classic controls is fine, but using the stick can be unreliable due to how precise it is.</p><p>It’s awesome that this is included, although I will say it’s not the most practical. The time it takes to activate isn’t great in a fast-paced game like this. Accidentally activating it and wasting your Ki doesn’t feel great either.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-recommend-id="image://2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midway through flying, Gohan rears back to throw a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Midway through flying, Gohan rears back to throw a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-recommend-id="image://2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midway through flying, Gohan rears back to throw a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sometimes you don’t want to do anything fancy and just want to fly in and hit your opponent with a heavy punch. The timing of that can be awkward when everyone’s moving around at high speeds. <strong>Dragon Dash Attack Assist aims to make this easier by automatically throwing out an attack when your dash is in close range to the enemy.</strong></p><p>I find this to be a great idea but with some messy execution. Landing an attack from a homing Dragon Dash is fine, but it’s pretty hit or miss if you’re trying to connect while flying around. The timing of when the melee attack comes out is awkward too, since the animation takes a while and you need to be very close to begin with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-recommend-id="image://06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu attempts to kick a guarding Gohan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Majin Buu attempts to kick a guarding Gohan." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-recommend-id="image://06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu attempts to kick a guarding Gohan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is a fast game and I wouldn’t blame anyone who has trouble defending against the many quick attacks.

            <p>
As if your games-to-movie adaptation plate wasn't already teetering dangerously with everything piled on it so far, Lionsgate has announced it's working on a film version of developer Red Barrels' survival horror series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a>.
</p>
<p>
The original Outlast launched back in 2013, casting players as journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated the notorious Mount Massive Asylum. Its effectively terrifying (and often quite grim) blend of first-person night-vision exploration and frantic chase thrills quickly attracted fans, leading to a story expansion the following year and a full-blown sequel in 2017.
</p>
<p>
This second outing - which saw players investigating a murder in the Arizona desert - ramped up the violence and strenuous pursuit sequences to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-2-review">slightly less positive reception</a>, but it still did well enough that Red Barrels was able to launch a third game, co-operative multplayer survival horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>, into early access last year.
</p>

<p>
And now the series is heading to the big screen courtesy of Saw studio Lionsgate, with horror film producer Roy Lee (Strange Darling, Late Night with the Devil, Barbarian) leading the charge. The project has also drafted in J. T. Perry, who's served as writer for all Red Barrel's Outlast games, to work on the movie's script.
</p><p>
"When Outlast launched in 2012, it changed the landscape of horror gaming," Lee wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement, "setting a new standard for immersion in the genre. Its deep, emergent lore has provided a perfect foundation for creating a film that delves into the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and the series' dedicated fans."
</p>
<p>
Details on the project are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/outlast-movie-lionsgate-1236162233/#:~:text=Watch%20on%20Deadline,genre%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Roy%20Lee.">Deadline's sources describe the movie</a> as a "modestly produced feature in the spirit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> and Lionsgate's own The Strangers: Chapter 1 and Saw movies."
</p>
<p>
Red Barrel's most recent release, The Outlast Trials, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">earned itself three out of five stars</a> when Vikki Blake reviewed it for Eurogamer earlier this year. "While I screamed a lot," Vikki wrote, "The Outlast Trials isn't scary – at least, not in the way its predecessors were. Whereas it apes some aspects of its original premise courtesy of those oh-shit-he-saw-me cat-and-mouse chase sequences, the cloying atmosphere has gone."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dfc-intelligence-reports-video-game-industry-gets-strong-2025-rebound/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report by DFC Intelligence, they reported that the video game industry is projected to have a significant turnaround in 2025. DFC Intelligence is the longest-standing research and advisory firm focused exclusively on the video game industry, and their new report suggests that 2025 will be a new beginning for the industry, with a long period of significant growth ahead. The full report will be available in December, but for today, DFC revealed some of the initial significant details of their report.</p>
<p>The details include a forecasted 15% growth in the PC and console game software market over the next four years. If this is true, that will take it from $72 billion in 2024 to $83 billion in 2028. This would be a significant change for the video games industry, which has been dealing with awful circumstances for a long time now. This year alone has seen the most layoffs out of recent years in a short period of time, as well as a mass amount of studios being closed. Many people have left the industry as a result of insecure conditions, as the number of jobs available has slimmed down significantly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/">layoffs</a>, company restructurings, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">company closures</a>.</p>
<p>"We've been monitoring and analyzing the video game industry since 1995, and over the past 30 years, it's grown twenty-fold," said DFC Intelligence Founder and Principal David Cole. "While the pandemic initially boosted the market tremendously, it's been trending downward since early last year, with 2024 representing a chaotic nadir that included mass layoffs, extensive closures, and acquisitions of small and mid-sized studios."</p>
<p>Not only has there been the issue of closures and layoffs, but both software and hardware sales haven't gone the way most companies expected. All of the major console brands have noticed considerable declines in their revenue, with Nintendo experiencing the biggest loss due to the lack of recent hardware updates. However, when the Nintendo Switch 2 eventually releases, they'll likely see a huge spike.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Back to the stats, 2023 saw high-end game consumers spend more on game-related hardware than on software for the first time. This includes console systems, gaming PCs, and other related accessories. DFC is expecting this to continue for the foreseeable future. This would make sense for the coming years, with the release of the PlayStation 5 Pro and the Nintendo Switch 2. At the moment, there is barely any news about upcoming consoles from Microsoft, but according to DFC, it's expected that only two upcoming systems will be successful in gaining meaningful market penetration.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the whole report, the report will be available in December, with a summary of the full report being <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/dfc-intelligence-dossier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in a newsletter</a>.</p>

The company says the <em>Call of Duty</em> game, which it released on October 25th, was responsible for a whopping 19 percent of its overall traffic last week.</p><p>It’s not really possible to quantify that further, given Comcast didn’t provide any specific numbers — either about how many customers were downloading the game or how big their downloads were. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6-file-size-explained/">Ranging between</a> 84.4GB for the PlayStation version and 102GB for the PC edition <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>is, in the grand tradition of <em>Call of Duty</em> games, a hefty download. It can be as much as 300GB if players choose to go ahead and download <em>Modern Warfare II </em>and <em>III</em> and all the associated content packs and languages, as Activision <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699">explained in June</a>.</p><p>Comcast bragging about its gigantic network traffic weekend in this way really underscores, if you scratch the surface a tad, just how restrictive its 1.2TB data cap can be in 2024. The company lifted that cap during the covid pandemic and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271148/fcc-data-cap-impact-consumers-inquiry">delayed reinstating it multiple times</a>, but nevertheless brought it back in most US states. </p><p>The FCC, which says providers have the “technical ability” to operate without such limits, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271148/fcc-data-cap-impact-consumers-inquiry">currently investigating</a> how they affect consumers. Whether the FCC can actually do anything about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24180118/supreme-court-chevron-deference-decision-opinion">is in question</a>.</p><p>For any players who did download the whole massive 300GB package, they’ll have wiped out a huge chunk of their 1.2TB Xfinity data cap in one fell swoop. If they used their internet as normal otherwise, that could put them right up against or even blow past that cap. Given that my family used nearly 800GB last month without any notably large game downloads, it wouldn’t be that hard at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-more-money-ubisoft-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft’s major financial update for FY24-25 is here, and it has made clear a few tantalising details about the company. One of the most interesting tidbits was the lifetime earnings of Ubisoft’s brands and live service titles. It was revealed that as a standalone game, Rainbow Six Siege has almost made more money than every other Ubisoft franchise.</p>



<p>That’s a <strong>lot </strong>of dollars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-performance">Impressive Performance</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2016 as Ubisoft’s flagship competitive shooter. It has since become one of the most beloved FPS games on the market, giving way to a thriving esports ecosystem, amongst other things. It is one of the best definitions of the live-service operating model in the gaming world – and it’s still expanding.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the recent financial report</a> published by Ubisoft, it was revealed that since 2016, Rainbow Six Siege has made a whopping €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion). It sits just behind <strong>the entire Assassin’s Creed series </strong>at €4 billion ($4.3 billion) and has beat the Far Cry series, which has made just €2 billion ($2.1 billion).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, several franchises have just topped €1 billion in consumer spending:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Division</li>



<li>Ghost Recon</li>



<li>Just Dance</li>
</ul>



<p>That means that if Rainbow Six Siege were to somehow secure €500 million in sales <strong>right now</strong>, it would single-handedly beat the consumer spending for every other Ubisoft franchise ever created, regardless of how long they’ve been on the market or how many games they’ve seen added to their lineup.</p>



<p>Ubisoft further confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege boasts a whopping 30 million unique active users, many of which will be contributing to the ongoing financial stability of the game.</p>



<p>Do you play Rainbow Six Siege? Have you ever invested money in it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed one of the reasons for the delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings call</a> on Wednesday, the studio was asked about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay, and whether there is a possibility of another one to later in 2025.</p>



<p>Chief Corporate Finance Officer Frédérick Duguet reiterated that the game has been feature complete, and that the delay was done to add more polish to the game as opposed to anything else.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-is-laying-off-staff">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nightingale-developer-inflexion-games-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightingale Developer Inflexion Games Is Laying Off Staff</a></h6>



<p>“We wanted to make sure that the delivery of the experience is impeccable on day one, so that was the purpose of the decision,” he said. “So we have a good visibility for the game to be delivered with a great experience by mid-February, and with great quality.”</p>



<p>He again said that the company is confident in a February release with a “great experience” and “great quality”. </p>



<p>As far as any specific reasons for the delay, Duguet said that the response to Star Wars Outlaws played a part in delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>“On the back of what we saw with Star Wars Outlaws, we need to really make sure that we come with an impeccable player experience on day one,”  he said. “Of course there are always some bugs, but we’ve been focusing, and we’re continuing to focus on, making sure that the day one experience will be well optimized.”</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws released on August 30, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled to reach one million copies</a> sold in the time frame that Ubisoft had hoped. </p>



<p>Regarding the price for delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft said that it added roughly $21.7 million to development costs. The company also announced in September that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-get-rid-of-traditional-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandoning the traditional Season Pass</a> model for the game.</p>
