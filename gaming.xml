            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-hands-on-with-a-20-player-outer-space-fps-that-mixes-sci-fi-with-sea-of-thieves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess I sorta suspected the day would come when my inner despot would awaken to wreak havoc on the galaxy, but I was surprised just how quickly it went down, after just a few minutes with the upcoming space-faring shooter: Wildgate. This chaotic sci-fi first-person shooter blends PvE and PvP objectives alongside exploration and combat on foot and aboard a ship that requires multiple people to operate – a formula that may feel quite familiar to any fellow Sea of Thieves fans. But unlike Sea of Thieves, where the chaos of player-on-player piracy is a somewhat infrequent and optional distraction, in Wildgate it’s the primary focus, and the inevitable clash of geared-up crews left me feeling the same heart-pounding intensity of a battle royale, as I barked commands at my crewmates and watched my enemies become just another cluster of space debris.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate pits five teams of four players against one another in a competitive space heist where time is of the essence and anything goes in these 20-40 minute brawls. Though there are 20 players in each procedurally generated world, you’re unlikely to run into any rival crews at the outset, instead using the calm before the storm to explore the miniature dungeons scattered throughout the cosmos. By delving into these places, slaying enemies that lie within, solving minor puzzles, and claiming loot, my squad and I gathered upgrades to bring back to our ship, including more powerful turrets, better shielding for our ship, ammo, healing items, and personal weaponry to carry into future battles. But our real purpose behind conquering these places as quickly as possible was to find the one and only Artifact hidden in each map. By collecting this all-important relic, every opposing team would be notified that we’d done so and be given an ongoing ping of our location as well. Then it was a mad dash to the Wildgate, and if we could fend off the enemy long enough to get to it, we’d instantly win the match and leave our adversaries choking on our space dust. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wildgate - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, every single rival player on the map would throw their full weight into preventing our escape, which is where the hilariously fun, full-on chaos of Wildgate shows itself. Though you can respawn infinitely after being killed, if someone destroys your ship, you’re knocked out of the match for good when killed, giving PvP especially high stakes. Ship-to-ship space combat is an intense, highly cooperative effort where you’ll need to share responsibility for piloting, manning mounted weapons, and repairing damage. The tools you’ve looted along the way can make that job easier and can have a pretty profound impact on how you approach combat. For example, on one run my crew found a bunch of close-range turrets that encouraged us to get up close and personal with the enemy to do high damage, while in another match I found a long-range sniper turret that allowed me to chip away at the enemy from a distance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you prefer a more subtle approach, you can always jump into space and jetpack your way aboard an enemy ship to blast enemies while they’re focused on piloting the ship, plant bombs to deal massive damage to their hull, steal the artifact out from under their noses if they’ve left it unguarded, or just hit the self-destruct button and defend the area until their core goes nuclear and wipes them out. This can turn the tables on an enemy that has better gear on their ship or has managed to outmaneuver you with their piloting skills by disrupting their ability to manage their vessel and pull focus from other, more pressing objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather not go through the trouble of hunting down an Artifact and racing through the escape gate, then you can do what I did and simply hunt down and eliminate every single enemy crew until you’re the last team standing. They can’t extract the Artifact if they’re dead, after all. This approach can prove especially effective since you’re able to scrap every downed ship for parts to add them to your growing arsenal. And if you’re especially slimy, like me, you can wait to ambush the enemy while they’re busy with a PvE dungeon, blowing up their ship while it’s unmanned, then swooping in to claim the hard-won loot from the area they were in the middle of clearing out. All’s fair in love and space piracy, my friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and replayability of this no-holds barred slugfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and replayability of this no-holds barred slugfest, and after more than six hours I still felt like I was only just beginning to figure out the best strategies to pull off a win consistently. For example, I learned the hard way that if you’re chasing an enemy ship who is seconds away from escaping through the Wildgate and you’re bombarding them with everything you’ve got, you should probably make sure you’re standing far enough away to not also blow yourself up in the process, resulting in a draw. Unlocking new characters and gear as you score XP also provides some new options, like the birdlike character, Mophs, whose unique ability to become invisible when boarding enemy ships can be especially useful in pulling off subterfuge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the small taste, I already get the impression that Wildgate will be one of those games where crazy things happen every single match that send me howling to my friends in victory or defeat, then swapping war stories with anyone who will listen the next morning, and if it manages to pull that off, it could very well be my next squad-based obsession.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Moonshot Games has announced a brand new team based shooter set in space, and it is called Wildgate. Wildgate will mix up space combat, looting, ship boarding, and a whole lot of first person shooting. If that sounds like something right up your street, you won’t have to wait long as there is going to be a&nbsp; <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/en-US/playtest/">Wildgate community playtest</a> from April 10th to April 14th which will be on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

			<p>The first Title Update for Monster Hunter Wilds is rapidly approaching, with information on the upcoming update being revealed in the Monster Hunter Wilds showcase today. Title Update 1 will be arriving in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us-more-than-half-of-its-sales-came-from-steam/">critically acclaimed RPG</a> on April 4, 2025. This update will be adding a familiar face, as well as some new features and challenges for players to take on.</p>
<p>Last making an appearance in Monster Hunter Rise, the Bubble Fox Wyvern Mizutsune will be making a return and heading into the Forbidden Lands on April 4. Players will be able to unlock the mission by speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest once they are Hunter Rank 21.</p>
<p>For a glimpse of what you can expect of this update on April 4, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6y-0sBUKGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As well as Mizutsune making a return, Arch-tempered Rey Dau will be making a debut in an Event Quest for players above Hunter Rank 50. This is designed for players who enjoy a challenge and want something that is beyond the Tempered monster hunts. Additionally, there will be a new Rey Dau Gamma armor set that players can forge as a reward.</p>
<p>Once players have reached Hunter Rank 50, there will also be a mission unlocked where players can hunt Zoh Shia again, where players will then be able to gather Zoh Shia parts for high-rank Hunter and Palico equipment.</p>

<p>The Title 1 Update for Monster Hunter Wilds will also be introducing the Grand Hub, where players will be able to socialize in new ways. This includes the new Barrell Bowling minigame, where you can earn useful items and pendants.</p>
<p>Also announced in the Monster Hunter Wilds March 2025 showcase was the return of classic gestures as free DLC. There will also be a Cosmetic DLC Pack 1 for Premium Deluxe Edition and Cosmetic DLC Pass holders. Through this, players will be able to give Alma a brand new outfit as well as the ability to change her glasses for free.</p>
<p>Overall, the upcoming Title Update for Monster Hunter Wilds is stacked with new hunts to go on, whether you're a high-level hunter or just getting started.

Once teams find it, they have to battle one another to extract. That can happen aboard spaceships or out in the void. But if a squad’s ship gets blown up, their journey will come to an abrupt end. It’s coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2025. </p><p>You can see where I’m getting the <em>Sea of Thieves </em>vibes from. The deep-dive trailer makes that even more apparent:</p><p>It’s an ambitious mashup of genres. <em>Wildgate</em> boasts “epic spaceship battles,” exploration through “cosmic storms,” plundering alien outposts for loot, and a unique cast of adventurers called Prospectors, each with their own arsenal of tools and abilities. The world and characters, which include a cat in a fish tank controlling a mech and a anthropomorphic goat warrior, are a bit all over the place, but I can see them growing on me if the gameplay loop is as fun as it sounds. </p><p>Whether <em>Wildgate</em> has the magic to put it over the top where so many other live-service multiplayer games have failed remains to be seen. Moonshot Games is helmed by some Blizzard vets who worked on <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, and other franchises, including producer Jason Chayes, designer Dustin Browder, and artist Ben Thompson. The team is part of Dreamhaven, the publishing label led by ex-Blizzard president Mike Morhaime. </p><p> “<em>Wildgate </em>rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” Morhaime said in a press release. “Since every match of <em>Wildgate </em>plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”</p><p>Today’s livestream also gave updates on Dreamhaven’s other partner projects. Secret Door’s tabletop-inspired RPG, <em>Sunderfolk</em>, will be $50 and is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on April 23. FuzzyBot’s <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>, a loot-based action-RPG cozy sim (yes, really), is headed out of Early Access for PS5, Xbox, and PC on May 22. Finally, Game River’s <em>Mechabellum</em>, a  tactical mech auto battler with shades of <em>Total Annihilation</em> that launched on PC last year, recently launched season 3 and is currently on sale. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Solo dev Wootus of Wootusart Industries has announced that the 2D shooter and strategy title War Rats: The Rat em Up will be available in Steam Early Access from April 22nd. In War Rats, you are a Rat commander that has to lead troops into a battle against the forces of TechnoRat. In this world rats are the only inhabitants.</p>
<p><iframe title="WAR RATS: The Rat em Up. Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DO7p18xH3po?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“As a solo dev, I would love to involve the players in shaping the game, especially when it comes to balancing. This kind of game can be very challenging for some players while for others it will be a breeze. I feel like Early Access would be a great place to get that balance right. I would also like people to be able to play the Singleplayer portion of the game without having to wait for Multiplayer to be finished”,</em>said Wootus.</p>
<p>War Rats battles are a mix of 2D action where you go and fight the enemy troops, and a base building as you command troops to construct things like turrets. You can also recruit more rat troops to face off against the enemy forces, as going alone will lead to absolute failure. The early access release will contain the full single player campaign as well as a skirmish mode that allows players to choose which map to fight in. The full release of War Rats, which is estimated to come out six months after the early access release, will contain co-op and PvP multiplayer. The additional modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Conquest. There will also be more single player content including horde mode.</p>

			<p>Several years after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-gets-delayed-to-november-30th-on-pc-a-bit-later-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original debut on PC</a>, Warhammer 40K Darktide continues to be updated with big patches. Today's free update is called Nightmares &amp; Visions and adds a new wave-based activity, significant enhancements to the Havoc end-game mode (including four new mutators), an overhaul of the Ogryn talent tree, a timed special event, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New game activity - Mortis Trials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Wave-based feature:</strong> upon reaching level 13, players will be able to mash through waves of enemies in visions induced by the ship’s Psyker, Sefoni. Each time they venture into the Psyker’s visions, they will be able to build new and exciting playstyles by selecting randomized abilities and buffs for the duration of the trial.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Choose Your Indulgence, Shape Your Playstyle –</strong> Before the battle begins, players select an Indulgence, each offering unique buffs that enhance combat styles. Pyrokinetic and Voltaic focus on elemental damage, Fulminator blends both, Death Dealer excels in close-quarters ranged and melee combat, and Colossus boosts survivability.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Trials of Endurance –</strong> Mortis Trials unfold in 12 escalating waves, with every third wave introducing an objective to complete. Success grants supplies and stronger buffs, culminating in a final gauntlet where players unleash their full potential.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Uncover lore and backstories -</strong> By overcoming the Mortis Trials, players will unlock memory echoes, granting them access to secret information on some of the main characters present on the Mourningstar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc mode gets a refresh -</strong> The end-game experience testing the resolve of the most seasoned operative reaches a new juncture with improvements and new daunting challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Improvements:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc Assignment Rank Overhaul -</strong> Fatshark made progression clearer and more rewarding for all players. Now, everyone who participates in a mission will rank up if they meet the new progression criteria, making group play more fulfilling.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Introducing Campaigns to Havoc -</strong> To keep gameplay fresh, Warhammer 40K Darktide will introduce a rotation system for mission pools and mutators in Havoc challenges, ensuring variety across play sessions. With the Nightmares &amp; Visions update, players will have their ranks reset to the nearest threshold based on the highest rank reached since the introduction of Havoc last year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New challenges -</strong> Fresh horrors are joining the fray with four new mutators added to Havoc:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Heinous Rituals -</strong> Heretics attempt to summon a new kind of Daemonhost, disrupt their rituals, or face the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>The Encroaching Garden -</strong> Specific enemies will heal their allies. If not promptly defeated, they will rapidly regenerate the ranks of the heretics.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Rampaging Enemies -</strong> Fallen enemies empower their allies with a surge of strength, making tactical planning crucial to avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Enraging Elites -</strong> Injured Elites will become enraged, increasing their attack and movement speed and giving them immunity to crowd control effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Time-Limited Special Event “A Day At The Theatre” -</strong> Following the release of Nightmares &amp; Visions, Warhammer 40K Darktide will be hosting a special event focusing on playing Mortis Trials, taking place in the theatre of the mind of the ship’s Psyker.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Ogryn Talent Tree Rework -</strong> The Ogryn class is getting a Talent Tree overhaul, providing players with increased build opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn talent tree has been revamped to expand viable melee builds, introduce stronger tank and support options, and improve ranged combat effectiveness. Melee builds are no longer locked into heavy attacks, with new talents supporting both light and heavy strikes. Tank-focused players now have more tools to define their play style, while ranged builds benefit from a reworked Burst Limiter Override, allowing for stronger explosive and sustained fire builds.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn's movement and survivability have also been improved. Dodge now staggers enemies, and new passives enhance damage resistance and coherency Toughness regeneration. Additional talents allow for hybrid play styles, rewarding players who mix melee and ranged combat. Overall, this rework aims to increase flexibility, making the Ogryn class feel more impactful and adaptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>

But when the <em>THPS 3+4</em> were announced, Margera was missing from the remake’s roster of new and old skaters.

Tony called up Activision or whatever and was like ‘Hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing,’ and they’re like ‘We can’t.’ And he goes ‘No, you’re gonna do it,’ and basically made them fly Bam back out here to get body-scanned and everything else, and put him in [<em>THPS 3+4</em>].”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Activision about the reported return of Margera. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>O</em>n March 24, <em>TMZ</em> corrobated the claims made in the podcast</a></span> and reported that it had heard from sources that Hawk was impressed by how well Margera had cleaned himself up and how he’s trying to stay sober.

The free update is out now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p><p>Two new MK-Challenges, the game's shorter-form missions, debut as Stash the Contraband and Kidnap the Mistress. Like other missions in the game, these are contextualized as brainwashing exercises, as the seedy Murkoff corporation attempts to get you to bend to their will before they release you as a sleeper agent sent into the world to cause Cold War-era chaos.</p><p>A bonus page of high-end cosmetics has been added to last season's Catalog, the game's free battle pass system, while a whole new Catalog is out now, too. It includes several skins, including one that resembles the Zodiac Killer's famous get-up. It's just the latest creepy skin in this game which seems to pride itself on its depraved cosmetics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465083" data-ratio="0.56455696202532" data-width="790" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465083"></a><figcaption>The new Outlast Trials Catalog (battle pass) is framed around the vigilante Amelia character currently trying to topple the villains of the story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465084,1300-4465085,1300-4465086,1300-4465087" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png"></figure><p>The Outlast Trials is also celebrating its first anniversary, so there are even more free cosmetics, such as a nausea-inducing cake, to be unlocked by completing the first-anniversary challenges. Both the new Catalog and these anniversary cosmetics are limited-time offerings, with them disappearing from the game in about a month on April 22.</p><p>As for game fixes, several Rigs (equippable cooldown abilities) have been buffed. The Barricade Rig can now apply to more doors and windows, locking them and slowing enemy pursuit. The Bling Rig now deploys faster at three seconds for its upgraded version or four seconds for its base version--each figure comes down one second from before the patch. The newest Rig, the Jammer, can now open mannequin gates the likes of which can be found in the nursery map.</p><p>The easiest difficulty also got a little easier, too, as enemies inflict less damage and move slightly slower. However, if all this sounds quite generous, it's not without some other punishing changes; the hardest difficulty, Psychosurgery, now features "slightly faster" enemies, as well. The full patch notes are found below:</p><h2>The Outlast Trials 2.1 update: Bug fixes and updates</h2><ul><li>Barricade Rig: Can now be deployed in more doorways and window frames.</li><li>Blind Rig: Base deploy decreased to 4 seconds (was 5 seconds), the upgraded is now 3s (was 4s).</li><li>Jammer: Jammer can now open automatic mannequin gates.</li><li>The nearest Revive Syringe location is now displayed to teammates when someone from the team dies.</li><li>Replay Introduction now displays a confirmation popup before launching.</li><li>The “Introductory” Difficulty has been adjusted for enemies to inflict less damages and move slightly slower.</li><li>The “Psychosurgery” Difficulty has been adjusted to slightly increase enemy speed.</li><li>The “Stay Together” Variator has been removed from Escalation Therapy.</li><li>Using the “Regroup” quick chat action now places a regroup icon on the ground at the player’s location.</li><li>Programs: A new visual indication is displayed for Trials completed in other difficulties than the one that is currently selected on the Trial Board.</li><li>Posters: Posters are now ordered by type (Weekly Programs, Events, etc.)</li><li>Settings: Added a new option to toggle mouse smoothing.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/none-of-that-fomo-stuff-here-remedy-shares-new-details-on-control-multiplayer-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>Remedy is a beloved developer in the gaming industry, responsible for creating surreal single-player experiences like Control and Alan Wake. However, its next game, FBC: Firebreak, is a multiplayer game, which prompted many questions from the studio's fans. To answer some of those questions, </span></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohYTWzw0Uno"><span><span><span><span>Remedy debuted a new trailer</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> during the Future Games Show Spring Showcase and supplemented it with </span></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rdE55zqOOc"><span><span><span><span>an additional trailer on its own page</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> and a </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/remedy-entertainment-reveals-altered-augments-for-fbc-firebreak/"><span><span><span><span>PS blog post</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, written by community manager Julius Fondem.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>Both trailers are gameplay-forward, showing off one of Firebreak's missions, known here as "Jobs," called Paper Chase. Since the game is set in the Federal Bureau of Control, mundane objects gain supernatural properties, which is both a boon and a bane to firebreakers. Paper Chase shows the hostile side of the two, as yellow sticky notes take over the surfaces of the map. It's the players' job to clear them off using bullets and explosives, while also gunning down the hordes of aggressive zombie-like monsters.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The second trailer, titled "Community First Look" features developer interviews that explain their creative approach to this game mode. "Is the idea something that could only happen in the Oldest House and that only Remedy as a developer would do?" development coordinator Jalmari Kunnari asks. "If the answer is yes to both of those questions, then it usually means we are on the right track."&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohYTWzw0Uno" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>The quote works as a catch-all explanation for pretty much everything we see in the trailers. Touch too many sticky notes and your character will become possessed by them, becoming a sticky note monstrosity of sorts. You can clean them off in the showers, but unless the heaters are on, you'll be cold and uncomfortable, losing movement speed as a result. If that wasn't wacky enough, the final boss is a sticky note colossus called "Sticky Ricky."</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Players are armed with plenty of tools to fight back with, however. Unlike the superpowered protagonists of other Remedy games, firebreakers are equipped with supernatural objects. Various weapons appear in the footage, but the PS Blog post focuses on Altered Augments, particularly unhinged additions to a Crisis Kit, which is a firebreaker's loadout. The Piggy Bank creates a deadly tornado of coins, the Teapot turns your ammo into boiling water, and the Garden Gnome summons a terrifying lightning storm (and haunts my dreams, though I think that's more of a personal problem). Notably, all three items also damage teammates, so you'll have to time your attacks carefully.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The community trailer ends with the reassurance that all post-launch content will be added in free updates, so there's no need to worry about game modes or weapons locked behind a paywall. "This isn’t a new hobby that you need to log onto every day for rewards," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/remedy-entertainment-reveals-altered-augments-for-fbc-firebreak/">the PS Blog reads</a>. "None of that FOMO stuff here." We'll see for ourselves when the game launches this summer.</span></span></p>

      <div><p>Free League Publishing launched its Kickstarter campaign for <em>Alien RPG Evolved Edition</em> today. The campaign for the updated version of their officially licensed Alien TTRPG reached its initial funding goal within 15 minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its Kickstarter page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/alien-rpg-second-edition-and-rapture-protocol/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Alien RPG Evolved Edition</em></a> contains an updated core rulebook, a new starter set, a cinematic adventure boxed set, and a set of miniatures.</p>

The book will feature new items, spaceships, and locations from the recent feature film <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. In addition, it will contain improved and streamlined stealth mechanics, a solo mode, stress and panic rules, and even zero-gravity rules.</p>

<p>For aspiring collectors and early backers, the campaign has some extras. If you back the campaign within 48 hours, you will receive a crew patch of the USCSS Fidanza, the spaceship featured in the cinematic adventure <em>Rapture Protocol</em>, at no additional cost.Finally, there is a Kickstarter-exclusive Collectors Edition of the Core Rulebook.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> is, for the most part, a pretty unexceptional game that does most things pretty competently, though it does manage to slip into that coveted 7/10, imperfect but has something special about it to keep you thinking about it. I'm talking about its Nemesis system, a mechanic that means certain enemies you face off against remember you and your actions as they get stronger, maybe even calling out certain occasions where they killed you. It's a lovely bit of design that, as it turns out, kind of just exists to stop the second hand game market.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
How so? Well, former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/warner-bros">Warner Bros</a> Games exec Laura Fryer recently explained as such in a recent YouTube video of hers. According to Fryer, while working with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/monolith-productions">Monolith</a> she explained to them that a problem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady's</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> faced in terms of sales was that people were buying the game, playing it, returning it, which would then of course be sold second hand. This meant Rocksteady, and subsequently Warner Bros., weren't getting as much money as they'd like.

<p>
"They were only getting paid for the first copy sold," Fryer explained. "They lost millions of dollars." Sure, multiplayer games were growing in popularity at the time, but as Fryer put it, "How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever?"
</p>
<p>
She went on to explain that Monolith's game engine couldn't really do a big open world like GTA, and they apparently weren't interested in multiplayer. So, they needed a hook. "And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory."
</p>
<p>
The Nemesis system is a great one, I put hours into Shadow of Mordor because of it despite not being all that much of a Lord of the Rings fan, but frustratingly it is patented until 2036, so you won't be seeing it in any other game any time soon. Especially because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">Warner Bros. closed Monolith last month</a>, cancelling its Wonder Woman game (which was set to feature the system) along with it. What a load of rubbish, if you ask me.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects.1144542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Over the past four months, Polish game developer CD Projekt Red has hired over 50 new employees to work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and other titles. The new entry in the iconic Witcher series is the only project currently in production, but CDPR has boosted the working numbers of almost all its other project departments.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdpr-has-been-increasing-the-size-of-almost-all-its-project-teams">CDPR Has Been Increasing the Size of Almost All its Project Teams</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/03/cd-projekt-group-presentation-fy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its earnings statement for the 2024 fiscal year today, highlighting the continuing success of Cyberpunk 2077 and the excitement built around The Witcher 4’s announcement. CDPR states that The Witcher 4 had the most watched trailer from The Game Awards’ slate of game premieres and had the most press coverage (measured in total article appearances and headlines).</p>



<p>Between the end of November (just a couple weeks before The Game Awards) and the end of this past February, CDPR brought on 57 new employees. 11 of those employees joined the already massive team working on The Witcher 4, increasing the total number to 411.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>However, the project that got the largest increase to its total size is the team working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-project-orion-2077-warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orion, the codename for Cyberpunk sequel</a> project. Over the last four months, that team increased by 20, growing from 64 to 84 employees. Prior to the start of this hiring wave, CDPR says they reached 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077 sold, and over 8 million copies sold of the critically acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>



<p>Fans shouldn’t expect the Cyberpunk sequel, or realistically any major CDPR release, anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is still in production, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-witcher-multiplayer-game-has-development-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the multiplayer Witcher project known as Sirius</a> is still in pre-production, and the Witcher remake, the Cyberpunk sequel, and a new IP project codenamed Hadar are still in their concept phases. There are also some unannounced projects in the works, including one from Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher remake.</p>

<p>Moonshot Games, a studio under Dreamhaven, has revealed its brand new online multiplayer shooter Wildgate. Set to launch on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year, Wildgate is a PvPvE crew-based first-person shooter that sees players travel into a vast area of space with the goal of capturing an ancient relic known as the Artifact.</p>



<p>The game features 20 player matches with five teams of four. Each team enters an area of space known as The Reach with a mission to capture the Artifact and make it through the Wildgate itself.</p>



<h6 id="h-preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year">PREVIEW: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate Could Be The Multiplayer Game Of The Year</a></h6>



<p>Every match can take anywhere from 20 to 40-plus minutes to complete as you explore and fight through a map that features procedurally placed elements. You choose one of five available prospectors—each having different abilities and tools at their disposal—and board one of five ships that also have different specializations. From there, how you play is up to you and your crew. You can choose to look for the Artifact quickly and escape or build up your ship to destroy those also looking for the rare relic. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ships can be upgraded throughout the match with new weapons, shields, and more to make it withstand the harsh elements of the Reach. You also can find new gear through various points of interest you encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>“Wildgate was designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” Moonshot Games studio head Jason Chayes said via release. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Wildgate will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC in 2025. There are plans to hold multiple playtests for players to get their first look at the game ahead of release. The first such playtest will take place from April 10-14 with <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signups open now</a>.</p>

The series is just so cozy and stress-free, and LEGO has done a great job of capturing that aesthetic. LEGO has released quite a few Animal Crossing sets as it continues to build up the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-nintendo-sets"> LEGO Nintendo brand</a>, but the one that I personally like the most has just dropped to its lowest ever price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza set has dropped down to only $41.20 as part of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-spring-deal-days">Amazon Spring Deal Days Sale</a>. That's a 48% discount that drops the price lower than we've ever seen it before.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best LEGO Animal Crossing Deal at Amazon Today</h2><div catalogid="0bdc76fd-be10-44de-9f3f-c12803224a29" id="217094"><div id="217094" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> LEGO Animal Crossing K.K.’s Concert in The Plaza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This LEGO Animal Crossing set was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-lego-sets-august-2024-and-beyond">first released back in August 2024</a> alongside the Fly with Dodo Airlines set and various new LEGO Mario options.

It's unlikely we will see a lower price than this, even for Prime Day or Black Friday, so right now is a great time to buy if you've already been considering it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set itself is only 550 pieces, so it can be easily put together in an afternoon. The centerpiece of the set is the classic Plaza and Resident services where Tom Nook is usually located, but it also comes with K.K's driveable camper van, a café, and a little tree permanently stuck in fall. You also get a little minifigure K.K. Slider (guitar included), Isabelle, and Audie. Although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/K.K._Slider_Song_List_and_Requests_Guide">K.K. Slider songs</a> are not included, you could always have them play in the background while you put it together.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more LEGO Animal Crossing sets</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Are There Any Upcoming LEGO Animal Crossing Sets in 2025?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO has been fairly consistent in releasing new Nintendo sets each year.

That being said, there are currently no new Animal Crossing sets that have been announced for this year. More may arrive in the second half of the year, but right now, there are still only 10 sets featured on the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/animal-crossing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEGO Animal Crossing page</a>.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Mar 25, 2025 5:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
