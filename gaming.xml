			<p>During the Warhammer Skulls 2025 livestream, Owlcat Games announced its next cRPG project: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>. As you can guess from the title, it's not a direct sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a> and will instead focus on the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Players will begin their journey as an acolyte of the Inquisition, their duty to investigate heresy, command a diverse warband, and influence the destiny of the Calixis Sector. The studio promises an immersive narrative experience where every decision carries weight and the Inquisition is portrayed in-depth, with its power, bureaucracy, and inner conflicts laid bare like never before.</p>
<p>As an Inquisitor, the players' primary goal is to protect the Imperium from the taint of Xenos, the betrayal of heretics, and the scourge of mutants by any means necessary. During the game, they'll explore the mysteries of the Tyrant Star and overcome the worst horrors of the Noctis Aeterna.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmfu_Spm-6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As in any good cRPG previously released by Owlcat, Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy will also offer players aid in the form of companions with different expertise and backgrounds. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects (such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catacha) to nefarious Xenos, including an avian-like Kroot mercenary. Each one features distinctive gameplay and a new perspective on the story with fully voiced dialogues. The game doesn't have a release date yet, but it can already be wishlisted on Steam.</p>
<p>During the same Warhammer Skulls live stream, Owlcat also unveiled Lex Imperialis, the second big expansion coming to Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-traders-first-expansion-void-shadows-moved-to-september-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Shadows</a>. In Lex Imperials, players will find a new 15-hour storyline that introduces the Adeptus Arbites, a faction of incorruptible enforcers, and a new companion—the grim and relentless Solomorne Antha. The expansion is out on all platforms on June 24.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lex Imperialis Release Date Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHDfU-iQRhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Owlcat announced a second Season Pass for Rogue Trader, which will provide access to two additional expansions coming in the future. The third expansion will allow players to enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite, where they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. The fourth DLC will let players explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships, descending into madness and mystery. Like the prior DLCs, these freshly announced expansions will introduce a new companion character, new quests deeply integrated into the main storyline, and new mechanics, delivering around 15 hours of gameplay. To celebrate all the news, the base game is discounted on all platforms.</p>

            <p>Relic Entertainment have announced Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition, an upgraded, 64-bit version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">your 29th favourite strategy game of all time</a>, which includes all of the original expansions and will be compatible with "over 20 years of lovingly crafted community mods".</p>
<p>The developers assert that "this is the iconic Dawn of War as players remember it, but optimized for modern hardware." Nonsense, Relic! In order for this to be Dawn Of War as <em>I</em> remember it, I would need to play it while subsisting entirely on cans of 20p Tesco tomato soup. Nowadays Tesco tomato soup costs 65p a can. It turns out that in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only rampant inflation. And 4K graphics. Here's the announcement trailer.</p>

<p>The Definitive Edition features four Dawn of War campaigns, encompassing nine armies and over 200 maps. You can expect upscaled textures and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting">image-based lighting</a>, together with an optimised HUD layout for widescreen displays and an "improved" camera. "World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting will faithfully enhance the moment-to-moment action," gushes the press release.</p>
<p>Back in February, a few months after Sega sold them to UK investment firm Emona Capital LLP, Relic unveiled plans for a fiendishly diversified mix of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-devs-relic-bounce-back-with-plans-for-big-rts-sequels-smaller-experiments-and-spiritual-revivals">big RTS sequels, smaller experiments and spiritual revivals</a>. Happy as I am that they're still in the Spice Maureen business, this does feel like a quick cash-in while they work on something brand-new. If you don't care for those Definitive technical flourishes, you can already find a Dawn Of War compendium on Steam in the shape of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4570/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Anniversary_Edition/">Anniversary Edition</a>, which also features all the old expansions and is currently 80% off till 29th May.</p>
<p>All this confirms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-skulls-returns-amidst-dawn-of-war-4-rumours">Nic's report</a> from earlier this week that "something Dawn Of War shaped" would turf up at this year's Warhammer Skulls event. Nic is our premier Games Workshop astropath and archivist. He knows his Great Knarlocs like I know yearly increases in the price of canned goods. Let us gather trustingly around his arcane relay in the hopes that he absently murmurs the words "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-chaos-gate-daemonhunters">Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters</a> sequel".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ever find yourself thinking, "man, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was a good video game, it sure would be swell if they made another one of those"? If so, the headline already spoiled this for you, but I'm going to pretend like it hasn't: a sequel was just revealed at the Warhammer Skulls Showcase! The reveal trailer mostly shows off what looks like more of the first game, but with boomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">shooters</a> that look this good, I think that's just fine.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right now, the game is currently slated for a 2026 release, with no more specific a window than that. I'm sure it'll be nowhere near GTA 6, just like literally every other game next year. A press release explains that enemies like Nurglings and Chaos Cultists will be making a comeback alongside the introduction of new enemies like Bloodletters and Juggernauts. I'm sure this'll all mean a lot more to Warhammer 40K lore heads than it does to me, honestly there could be an enemy called Hellsuckers and I'd believe you.

<p>
On top of all that there'll be new weapons to pick up, locations to explore, and a storyline with different branches to head down, each with their own unique levels.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and there's actually another new Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun game you can play right now too, Words of Vengeance. This one's a "first person typer", so think games like The Typing of the Dead, but with a Warhammer 40,000 paintjob. Words of Vengeance looks silly as hell, and it's even completely free! Love that.
</p>
<p>
There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/36406/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_Anniversary__Boltgun__Graia_Collection/">Steam bundle</a> with the original Boltgun, alongside the first Space Marine, that's 47% off at the moment if you've not played either of them before. You can also wishlist Boltgun 2 on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115160/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun_2/">right here</a>, and pickup Words of Vengeance on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533730/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance/">here</a>.

I love the moral conundrums it presents, the violent grief it depicts, and the games’ excellent writing that poignantly brings all of those complicated emotions to the surface. What I don’t like is listening to pretty much any of the creative team talk about the series, especially when it comes to weighing in on decade-long discourse around its complex storylines. Even when I agree with series director Neil Druckmann’s interpretation of something, we’d all rather he just let bad readings fester in the corners of the internet than tell us exactly what something means. Nevertheless, he continues to do so in interviews.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,196196,195776" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a discussion with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;ab_channel=LastStandMedia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;ab_channel=LastStandMedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Symbols</a></span> podcast (thanks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-finale-question-definitively-answered-by-series-creator-upending-years-of-fan-debate&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-1-finale-question-definitively-answered-by-series-creator-upending-years-of-fan-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>), Druckmann talked about the end of <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>, which was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tlou-last-of-us-recap-s1e9-finale-joel-ellie-giraffe-1850217781">adapted for television</a></span> in the HBO show’s first season. In this climactic moment, Joel—a smuggler turned surrogate father to Ellie, the young girl immune to a fungal infection that has leveled the series’ post-apocalyptic world—massacres members of a revolutionary group called the Fireflies who sought to use Ellie’s immunity to create a vaccine. They could potentially have saved millions of lives and helped society rebuild again after decades of ruin. But after months of traveling across the United States to reach the group’s base in Salt Lake City, Joel wasn’t willing to lose Ellie for something as small as the possibility of a world-saving vaccine. After the player fights their way through the facility and escapes with Ellie, Joel lies to her about what happened, and they live happily ever after(?) in Jackson, Wyoming…until the sequel, at least.</p><p>It’s a nuanced situation, and ever since <em>The Last of Us </em>launched in 2013, fans have debated the ethics of pretty much every character in this finale. However, one part of the discussion that has persisted is the question of whether or not the Fireflies would have been able to successfully create a cure or vaccine in the first place. This is the post-apocalypse. They’ve got one surgeon here who claims to be able to do the job, and even if they managed to concoct a vaccine, how would they distribute it? All of that is an interesting logistical discussion, but some fans have taken that talking point a step further and tried to claim the potential success of the plan was ever part of Joel’s motivations. It’s very obvious that the man cares about Ellie’s life above all else, and didn’t stop to weigh up the vagueries of vaccine efficacy in a zombie apocalypse I’ve always read these attempts to explain away Joel’s guilt as cope, and the idea that he had a firm confidence that the Fireflies’ attempts would fail as an effort to wash away the reality of Joel’s actions.</p><p>Yet now, Druckmann has confirmed that it was always the intention for the group’s medical team to be able to create the cure, essentially nuking that talking point. Am I upset that we can now put this obviously desperate theory to bed? No. Do I wish Druckmann would stop giving definitive answers to a story that has thrived in ambiguity and interpretation? Absolutely.</p><p>“Our intent was yes, they could [make a cure],” Druckmann said. “Now, is our science a little shaky that now people are now questioning it? Sure. Our science is a little shaky and people are now questioning it. I can’t say anything. I can say our intent was that they would have made a cure. That makes the most interesting philosophical question for what Joel does.”</p><p>Sure, it’s the most interesting interpretation because it actually interrogates everything you know about Joel based on how he presents. Giving him an out is just refusing to engage with the text. Do you want to debate if the Fireflies were <em>equipped</em> to save the world with a vaccine? That’s an entirely separate discussion from Joel’s motivations. But even so, we don’t need every detail spelt out. Maybe it’s because Druckmann is being constantly interviewed about this series after two games, more remasters than I care to count, and two seasons of television, but the more we talk to this dude (and HBO series showrunner Craig Mazin) and ask him to tell us what it all meant, the less interesting the story can be. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-was-right-hbo-max-finale-1851773550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-was-right-hbo-max-finale-1851773550">I don’t want to know if Druckmann thinks Joel was right</a></span>.

                <p>Waiting for your favorite boomer shooter to get a sequel while currently enjoying the latest Doom game? No, it's not 1993, because Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has been officially revealed, and it looks to deliver on all the fast-paced action, bloody dismemberment, and incredibly mean taunts that fans expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Malum Caedo, the Space Marine who players controlled in the first game, will return for a sequel that promises to visit "never-before-seen locations in the Warhammer 40,000 universe." Alongside returning enemies like Nurglings, newcomers like the Bloodletters and Juggernauts will also be trying their best to turn Caedo into a pile of giblets.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rG19wrCGR5g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer presented during Warhammer Skulls 2025 was relatively short but showed off Caedo blasting away a variety of enemies and slicing them to tiny pieces with his chainsword. If it's half as good as the original game, it should be both a worthy homage to classic '90s shooters and a must-play game for the franchise's fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 is scheduled to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, but developer Auroch Digital has something very different to keep fans happy until then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l-3morfa24" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5l-3morfa24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Available now, Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun - Words of Vengeance is essentially the 40,000 take on Typing of the Dead. Players have to type out words from the extensive Warhammer 40,000 lore to destroy enemies of the Emperor. The best part is it's completely free, though because of its core gameplay, it's only available on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">For more from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer Skulls 2025</a>, check out everything announced during the event, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

            <div property="schema:text"><p>The <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/six-one-indie-showcase-returns-next-week-with-48-games-including-mouse-pi-for-hire-and">Six One Indie Showcase</a> just wrapped, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase">highlighting more than 40 rad indie games</a> with world premieres, exclusive reveals, and more. It was this year’s best indie game showcase and one of my favorites ever, which is why it’s exciting to see the team behind it announce its new publishing arm: Six One Publishing.</p><p>Coming from the Six One Indie team, Six One Publishing was “created for developers who need an impactful partner to help them cross the finish line.” The team describes itself as an “integrated, indie-first platform” that aims to reimagine what publishing can look like in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>“We’re here to blur the lines,” Six One Publishing creative director Mike Towndrow writes in a press release. “The number of games hitting the market grows by the day, but unfortunately, the people to cover and amplify them seem to dwindle just as fast. Six One Indie has evolved into an ecosystem that can now offer a unique opportunity to get indies in front of players through fresh, unconventional means.”</p><p>Six One Publishing says working with it means “gaining direct access to every part of the Six One ecosystem – from original video content and editorials to our growing slate of indie showcases and creator collabs. By fusing the best parts of publishing, media, and community into one agile framework, we’re rewriting the rulebook to serve developers – not shareholders.”</p><p>Towndrow concludes the press release by stating he believes indies "deserve a major push backed by authenticity, genuine enthusiasm, and a new approach for an unpredictable industry.”</p><p>If you want an idea of the types of indies Six One Indie wants to get eyes on, look no further than <a href="https://gameinformer.com/round-up/2025/05/21/every-game-shown-during-todays-six-one-indie-showcase"><em>Game Informer’s</em> round-up of every game shown during today’s Six One Indie Showcase</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>

From Stranger Things and The Lord of the Rings to Assassin's Creed and Street Fighter, Magic: The Gathering fans have had ample ways to simultaneously celebrate their fandom of both the beloved TCG and other franchises. The Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy set is the latest in the long-running TCG's collaborations, and it feels like one of the more popular and anticipated crossovers in recent memory.</p><p>In the lead-up to the Final Fantasy set's June launch, we've seen several reveals of iconic characters like Sephiroth, Lightning, Yuna, Clive, and others from across the entire Final Fantasy series. Today, <em>Game Informer </em>can exclusively reveal three more cards coming to the Final Fantasy set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reach the Horizon</strong> features art of the core cast of Final Fantasy VII staring off into the distance, with a quote from Tifa at the bottom. It allows you to search for up to two distinct basic land and/or Town cards and put them into the battlefield. Also from Final Fantasy VII is the <strong>Weapons Vendor</strong>, which lets you draw a card, and at the beginning of your turn, you can pay one Mana, allowing you to attach Equipment to a creature you control. The final card we're able to reveal comes from the original Final Fantasy, <strong>World Map</strong>. When sacrificed, you can search your library for land cards to put into your hand.</p><p><strong>You can see all three of these cards exclusively in the gallery below:</strong></p><p>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy is scheduled to arrive on store shelves on June 13.

And season 2.5 might be the game’s biggest shake-up yet. I’ve got good news for Punisher mains and bad news for Captain America lovers.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250522/40954_1236193.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250522/40954_1236193.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 22, NetEase posted a new video</a></span> featuring the developers of <em>Rivals </em>talking about the upcoming season 2.5 patch. The new update is set to arrive on May 30 across all platforms. First, the news you’ll likely care about most if you regularly play <em>Rivals</em>: Who is getting nerfed and buffed?</p><h2 id="h649765"><a id=""></a>All the buffs and nerfs in <em>Rivals </em>season 2.5</h2><p>Both <strong>Groot</strong> and <strong>Captain Americ</strong>a’s survivability will be getting toned down a bit in season 2.5. Meanwhile, <strong>Emma Frost</strong>’s “Diamond Form” will be getting nerfed, too. All members of the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> and <strong>Namor </strong>are getting a nerf to their team-up abilities. Separately,<strong> Human Torch</strong> is getting a nerf alongside <strong>Iron Fist </strong>and<strong> Psylocke</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-punisher-marvel-rivals-dps-sorry-nerf-overwatch-ps5-1851740643&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-punisher-marvel-rivals-dps-sorry-nerf-overwatch-ps5-1851740643"><strong>Punisher</strong> (yes!)</a></span>, <strong>Squirrel Girl</strong>, and <strong>Storm </strong>are getting “modest” buffs. Hopefully, that means Punisher’s rifle will actually kill people and not harmlessly bounce off most heroes like a peashooter. <strong>Doctor Strange </strong>and <strong>Magneto </strong>are also getting similar “modest” buffs. </p><p>A bunch of team-up changes are happening in 2.5, including the removal of some popular ones. Goodbye to Iron Man and Hulk’s gamma team-up. Other team-ups being retired: Luna Snow and Jeff, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Punisher and Rocket, and also Venom and Peni. But a ton of new team-ups are coming, including ones for Iron Man and Ultron, Black Widow and Punisher, and Luna Snow and Hawkeye. The wildest new team-up is between Storm and Jeff. You’ll be able to create sharknados when combining their ultimate abilities.</p><p>2.5 is also adding a new map, which seems neat, and Ultron, who will be the game’s first new strategist since Invisible Woman was added back in update season 1. He seems to be a healer who will be able to deal out a ton of damage in addition to delivering a lot of healing. Interestingly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1925568333165797807&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1925568333165797807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase is also planning to add a full-on new mode to <em>Rivals</em></a></span>. You’ll be able to play an autochess-like game inside <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in 2.5 and will command your minions as Ultron. Weird!</p><p>Lastly, a reminder that moving forward and starting in season 3, seasons will only be two months long instead of three, and there won’t be any more .5 mid-season refreshes. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>will also get a new hero every month once this new schedule is in place. That sounds hard to balance to me, but hey, who doesn’t like new toys? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Start your service as an acolyte of the Inquisition: Investigate heresy, command a diverse warband, and shape the fate of the Calixis Sector in a story-rich experience where every decision has weight, justice is non-existent, and the line between salvation and damnation is razor-thin. Explore an in-depth depiction of the Inquisition as an organization and the vast force it commands: its power, bureaucracy, and inner conflicts laid bare like never before.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As an Inquisitor, you have one primary goal: to protect the Imperium, whether that be from the taint of xenos, the betrayal of heretics, or the scourge of mutants, by any means necessary. Be the conduit of the Emperor’s will in a place where all hope was lost decades ago, explore the mysteries of the maddening Tyrant Star, and overcome the worst horrors thrown at you by the Noctis Aeterna.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_966519"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Uncover the Truth, No Matter the Cost</strong></p><p>Your duty is to investigate heresy deep within the Calixis Sector.

Uncover nefarious plots, interrogate suspects, and piece together conspiracies in a deep investigative system. The only question is, how far are you willing to go on the path of damnation in the name of salvation?</p><p><strong>You Are Not <a title="Games > Alone in the Dark (2024) [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/alone-in-the-dark-2024">Alone in the Dark</a>ness</strong></p><p>Every Inquisitorial warband is unique, and yours is no exception. Ranging from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including an avian-like Kroot mercenary. Each and every one of them offers distinctive gameplay and a new perspective on the story with fully voiced dialogues.</p><p><strong>Fight on Your Terms</strong></p><p>Turn-based combat rewards careful planning and ruthless efficiency: target enemy weak points and keep each party member’s morale high to gain the upper hand in every battle. Managing their individual morale effectively will maximize their combat potential. Complex yet elegant systems ensure deep interactivity, making every decision in combat impactful and every kill brutally satisfying.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p>Each army in Warhammer 40,000 has its own codex containing rules, lore, and nice pictures, and The Leagues Of Votann's - the game's contemporary space dwarves - was out of date before a single model was available to buy. Advance copies went out, people noticed that the rules were horribly broken, more people noticed that the rules were actually massively, horribly, absurdly broken, and the company issued an apology, pulling out their <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2CjuqDSg/leagues-of-votann-balance-update-a-word-from-james-workshop/">cutesy 'James Workshop' moniker</a> in an attempt to aw shucks the fact they'd just sold everyone some very expensive hardback kindling. They later issued some rules errata, and they're supposedly in a more sensible spot now, even if doing anything interesting with them visually is confined, as per, <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/Grendl-Grendlsen-Squat-Bounty-Hunter-2018">to Necromunda</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to bet money on it, I'd guess they won't be nearly as broken in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus 2</a> when they appear as potential allies or foes for both the Ad-mech and Necron playable factions. That's because difficulty balance was one of the major problems holding the original Mechanicus back from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> greatness (the game was later patched), so I imagine it being at the forefront of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulwark">Bulwark</a> Studio's mind this time. Decide for yourself by observing the trailer below. How many busted tokens do these dwarves have in their beards?</p>

<p>If you skipped the first Mechanicus, it was notable for a couple of things: an absurdly entertaining action economy that let your late game popebots sweep maps without stopping for breath (do Ad-mech breathe?) and a soundtrack that felt like a <a href="https://youtu.be/asr6_eNCuoU">pipe organ had gained sentience</a> and declared war on reality itself. It was, balance aside, a good time, and I'm interested to see what Bulwark have learned from their first outing.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the game's Steam page lists the release date as TBA, but the presser I received reckons it's out sometime this year. This may be old news by the time you're reading this, by which time hundreds of billions of cells in my body will have been replaced. A truly antiquated and wasteful biological system I wouldn't have to deal with if the machine god would simply bless my digusting, fallible flesh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Accompanied by her brother Michael you will traverse unfamiliar places, character conflicts, and story affecting decision making. You have the power to help the world or let it rot. Careful your presence has caught the attention of something sinister…</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Many indie <a title="Genres > RPG [17,266 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> claim to be a new quirky game, but <em>Away From Home</em> is a mix of many great RPGs. The characters are full of emotion and let you empathize with them. Don’t forget that this world needs you.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Imagine if a <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,645 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> and a Rhythm game had a love child. This game plays like Earthbound when it comes to walking and talking in it’s overworld, but when it comes to missions and battles it throws in <a title="Genres > Rhythm [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm games</a> related to the event. Characters also have real voices to help create mood and feeling to them. The big highlight of the gameplay is the huge amount of animations. The characters in this world are alive and through your gameplay you will begin to understand.</p><p>The amount of things to do in locations are never ending. Chocked full of lengthy side missions that unlock you new moves and items as well as random chance based events. The progression of side quests and random town events are based from entertaining games such as <em><a title="Series > Yakuza (Like a Dragon) [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/yakuza">Yakuza</a> 0</em>!</p><p>The world is large and will take you hours to complete everything, not to mention alternate routes that bring replayability. Some routes include game changing decisions as well as items and battles you wouldn’t be able to do had you made different choices.</p><p><strong>Battles</strong></p><p>The battles are in a third-person view with rhythm-based function. The UI has a fight button, special button, items button, and block button. Using arrow keys your <a title="Genres > Action [2,733 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will be in sync with the music. If you press a key on the beat, you gain action points for special attacks.</p><p>For the first time, skill and strategy are balanced out by the battle system. You will need to use skill to time your choices and hits in time. Mean while you will need to use strategy to counteract opponents special attacks. Such as if you have an opponent with poison, you will want to apply anti poison items in your arsenal. Both you planning and action will be put to the test.</p><p>Items are unlocked by completion of side quests and can be purchased at the stores, some items are very powerful and can only be received once. You must plan three items to bring into battle and have immediately available. As well as unlock special moves that pair well with your arsenal.</p><p>The battles are stocked full of special effects to keep the fight lively! Rather than being told what’s happening around you like in a traditional RPG, you will get to witness everything from falling confetti to flashes of lightning!</p><p>Enemies have special attacks as well. Enemy specials send you into a full on quick time event with high detailed pixel art. Where you must hit provided keys. Failure to hit them in time results in major damage taken.</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>This game has may talented artists including yours truly. We bring life to the game in visually stunning ways. We focus on facial expression as well as detailed animation. Many people have poured their souls into this project. Some animations in the game took over 100 hours and I’m exited for you to see them.</p><p>We hope to convey emotion and expression in ways similar to games like Mother 3. With the high rendered detail in this game, every pixel counts. One pixel could change frown to a smile. So attention to detail goes a long way.</p><p><strong>Music</strong></p><p>This game has an outstanding soundtrack so far. Music determines so much in a game such as mood, atmosphere, and tension. The original soundtrack has many amazing artists including NickNuwe, Chaotrope, Zakku, and Nelward.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
