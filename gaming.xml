		<p>Team17 has announced Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition for Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, celebrating the game’s 25th anniversary on 26th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-EoD-bXDCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having come out all the way back in 1999, Worms Armageddon is still considered by many Worms fans to be the high point of the series and it quite impressively still clings onto a daily player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/217200/charts/">a few hundred people on Steam</a>. It’s continued to outshine the potentially better for online play Worms World Party, which had a remaster a few years ago, and level pegs with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/22/worms-wmd-review/">Worms WMD</a>, which is also a fine take on the classic 2D form that is somehow already 8 years old!</p>
<p>This Anniversary Edition takes the PC game and gives it the once over with modern improvements and touches to work on console – the game has actually had periodic updates on PC <a href="https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/">as recently as 2022</a>.</p>
<p>These bonus features and upgrades include:</p>

<ul>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Optimized controller support for all consoles.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Achievements and Trophies</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> New display features such as modern aspect ratios, custom screen filters, enhanced HD and graphics options.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Fully playable Game Boy Color version of Worms Armageddon</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> An interactive museum that charts the history of the entire series. Featuring never-before-seen interviews with developers of the original and current games.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> New save system</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to head online, you’ll be able to play with up to six players teaming up or competing. The only caveat is that there’s not cross-play, so Switch, PlayStation and Xbox gamers are being kept separate – cross-gen play is possible, though.</p>

<p>The original Epic Mickey was released in 2010 for the Nintendo Wii. It was developed by the now-closed Junction Point Studios. The remaster of the game is being developed by Purple Lamp and Disney Games. The game’s original director Warren Spector helped with this new version of the game. As part of the remake, the game was developed in Unreal Engine as opposed to the Gamebryo engine from the first title.</p>







<p>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed launches on September 24 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>Aside from the numerous optimization issues plaguing the overall experience, one thing stood out when I first started playing Star Wars Outlaws. The controls felt awkward and strange for some reason, but I couldn’t quite understand why. Then, it hit me. They’ve swapped standard controls. You use the analog sticks to interact with everyone and everything, which feels cumbersome and unintuitive. Thankfully, you can change your controls in Star Outlaws, and yes, it does make a difference!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-change-controls-in-star-wars-outlaws">How to Change Controls in Star Wars Outlaws</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you can swap controls by opening your game’s pause menu, selecting <strong>Settings</strong>, and then navigating to <strong>Controls</strong>. From there, choose <strong>Show Controller Layout</strong>, and hit ‘RB” on your controller to switch from Default to <strong>Alternate</strong>. It’s a simple tweak that <strong>swaps the Melee from X to Right Stick and Interact from Right Stick to X</strong>.</p>



<p>By default, most games have the interact action tied to one of the face buttons, which makes it more intuitive to access quests, pick up items, and interact with the environment. But in Star Wars Outlaws, they opted for having the player click on the right analog stick, which doesn’t feel good, for lack of a better descriptor.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-use-a-controller-or-mouse-and-keyboard-for-star-wars-outlaws">Should You Use a Controller or Mouse and Keyboard for Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>If you’re playing on a PC, you have options. You can play with a controller or mouse and keyboard, both of which work well. However, from personal experience playing the game, I can tell you that it feels like Outlaws was designed from the ground up as a console title. As such, a controller feels more responsible and intuitive.</p>



<p>I recommend trying the game out with a controller to see how it feels. While you can certainly aim more accurately with a mouse and keyboard, movement, flying, and driving feel better with a controller. </p>



<hr>



<p>Much of the game revolves around understanding the various controls, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-lockpick-star-wars-outlaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking mini-game</a>. Use what works best for you!</p>

                <p>At the Xbox Games Showcase this year, Microsoft officially announced the next entry in the Gears series, and it's going back in time. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, as it's called, is coming to Xbox and PC in the future.

Gears 4 ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, so some fans were hoping to see Gears 5 instead of a prequel, but that could be a story that's being saved for another day.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know so far about Gears of War: E-Day, including what the story involves, who's developing it, what platforms to expect the game to come to, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Gears_of_War__E_Day_be_released_">When will Gears of War: E-Day be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Gears_of_War__E_Day">Preorder Gears of War: E-Day</a></li><li><a href="#Watch_the_Gears_of_War__E_Day_trailer">Watch the Gears of War: E-Day trailer</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_platforms">Gears of War: E-Day platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_story__setting__and_characters">Gears of War: E-Day story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_game_engine">Gears of War: E-Day game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Gears_of_War__E_Day_">Who's developing Gears of War: E-Day?</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_development_news">Gears of War: E-Day development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Gears_of_War__E_Day_be_released_">When will Gears of War: E-Day be released?</h2><p>The Gears of War: E-Day announcement trailer did not include a release date, or even a release window, for the game.

X|S and PC. Microsoft is bringing some of its games these days to rival systems like PS5 and Switch, but for now, Gears of War: E-Day has been announced only for Xbox and PC. Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-generation Xbox console</a>, but it's too soon to say if this new Gears of War game will show up there.</p><h2 id="Gears_of_War__E_Day_story__setting__and_characters">Gears of War: E-Day story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The cinematic trailer shows a young Marcus Fenix struggling with a single Locust, something he's not prone to doing in the later games--but this a greener, less experienced Marcus.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day takes place 14 years before the events of Gears of War. It focuses on Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago coming home to "face a new nightmare" in the Locust horde. The game serves as an origin story for the Gears of War series, and the name E-Day refers to Emergence Day. This is the day when the subterranean monsters rose up from below the surface to lay waste to humans.</p><p>While the game is called E-Day, referring to that one fateful day, the game itself will span multiple days and not just one, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to the developers.</a></p><h2 id="Gears_of_War__E_Day_game_engine">Gears of War: E-Day game engine</h2><p>Gears of War: E-Day is in the works at The Coalition using Unreal Engine 5, which is the latest version of Epic's game development toolsuite. Microsoft says Gears of War: E-Day will deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." As of yet, however, no gameplay footage has been revealed.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_Gears_of_War__E_Day_">Who's developing Gears of War: E-Day?</h2><p>Gears of War: E-Day is in development at the Microsoft-owned Canadian game studio The Coalition. The studio previously made Gears 5 and Gears of War 4. The studio also assisted 343 Industries with Halo Infinite.</p><h2 id="Gears_of_War__E_Day_development_news">Gears of War: E-Day development news</h2><p>Gears 5 changed things up with its more open-ended maps, but Gears of War: E-Day will pull that back somewhat and bring back the franchise's more traditional linear levels. Creative director Matt Searcy told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, "We know for sure that Gears, you know, has those linear, epic moments in them."</p><p>For Gears of War: E-Day, Searcy promised that the team will "absolutely be doing more of that" as it relates to more linear missions.</p><p>As for continuing the Gears of War story chronologically speaking, Microsoft said "other ongoing stories" in the franchise will be told... eventually. However, the "collective passion for such an iconic origin story was simply too great to ignore," <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft said.</a></p><p>Another important thing to know is Gears of War: E-Day is not a spin-off. "It's a completely new entry to the mainline series, set earlier in the timeline. The events of the game not only serve as an exciting origin tale of two beloved characters, but it also adds detail and context to this period that will resonate through stories that will follow," Microsoft said.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Gears of War: E-Day as we learn more.</p>

As the hunter traipsed through maze-like jungles or arid deserts, they’d bump into creatures that fit those biomes, which made up the hierarchy of monster in a given region. Everything from the lowliest critter at the bottom of the food chain to the apex predator at the top was accounted for, and getting to see these monsters interact and even fight each other was (and still is) a thrill.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>doubles down on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer-scoutflies-classes-minimap-1851613731&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer-scoutflies-classes-minimap-1851613731">many of these features</a></span>, especially the focus on living ecosystems, and expands on or refines just about everything else about the experience to make it the most razor sharp installment in the series yet. It refreshes the slinger—the hunter’s slingshot—into a much more dynamic tool in their repertoire, and even provides a mount (a feature introduced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a></span>) to ensure the game teems with life from the very get go.</p><h2 id="h46448"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>hands-on</strong></h2><p>After a few cutscenes established <em>Wilds </em>’primary characters , I was almost immediately launched directly into the action-packed opening which had me leaping onto a Seikret mount and pursuing a kid being hunted by a pack of sandworms through the desert. The heavily on-rails section does a pretty good job of introducing and highlighting many of the basic movements players will become used to, such as farming slinger ammo from small enemies, using its new grappleshot function to tear apart pieces of the environment, and using the mount to navigate tough terrain. That it manages to communicate these mechanics while keeping things exciting is key to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The <em>Monster Hunter </em>series is famous for its complexity and the sooner it can demystify that notion and get you straight into its top-notch combat, the better.</p><p>Speaking of which, after you manage to save the kid, you are sent on the game’s first proper hunt against the Chatacabara, a large amphibian monster that covers its weak points with protective rock armor. At this point, I grabbed my insect glaive (my chosen weapon of the past few <em>Monster Hunter </em>games) and immediately fell back into my old rhythm. For fans of the series who have played several games, don’t expect <em>Wilds </em>to be an immense departure from business as usual. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, y’know? Capcom reworked some of the weapons—and it breaks my heart that you can no longer bounce off of the end of an aerial glaive attack—but some time with it, the switch axe, and the light bowgun proves that the developers aren’t doing away with the solid foundation that’s been built over the series’ history.</p><p>Instead, <em>Wilds </em>is trying to streamline the often laborious process of hunting a monster to ensure that everyone who picks up the game can feel like they’re getting the best experience. You still need to track monsters down via scoutflies that emit a glowing trail, and fights are functionally the same as they always have been, with parties of up to four players picking away at massive creatures with the series’ 14 main weapons, and a slew of other tools and traps. There are some new things in <em>Wilds </em>though that should make players feel way more impactful, like the new Focus feature.</p><p>Focus allows the player to aim their attacks by holding down the left trigger and summoning a reticle, which <em>is </em>a significant change for folks who use melee weapons. By focusing, attacks can now be delivered with more precision than ever, which lends itself well to picking at weak spots and opening up wounds on monsters, which will glow red when in Focus mode. While focusing does little to change your moveset, it does provide a Focus Strike which is tied to the right bumper, and every weapon has its own. These high-powered moves are essential to targeting wounds to maximize damage, which can speed up hunts, break off parts of the monster that can be turned into gear, and even stagger them.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>players have gotten by this far without such a tool, but I think it’s a game-changer. For beginners, it will be handy to be able to attack with more precision than is usually the case. I spent my first several hours of <em>Monster Hunter World </em>fumbling my attacks before I learned to read enemy patterns and pick my moments. For players at every level, Focus now tells you exactly where you should be targeting by highlighting wounds and it does so subtly. Any feature that communicates vital information without bludgeoning the player with a billion tooltips (or worse, a garish new bit of UI or overlay) is a win in my book, and I see no reason why everyone shouldn’t be using Focus by default in <em>Wilds</em>.</p><h2 id="h46449"><a id=""></a><strong>The thrill of the hunt</strong></h2><p>The hunt itself went smoothly. The Chatacabra’s a great first monster, because it’s just menacing enough to where if you don’t take it too seriously it could sneak up on you, but it’s also incredibly slow. That means that it telegraphs its moves significantly ahead of time, giving even the most nerve-wracked hunters enough time to dodge out of the way. The Seikret mount picks you up and immediately hauls ass when summoned, which is incredibly handy for getting out of a tough pickle like that, and their ability to hold a second weapon—which needs to be unlocked down the road— will massively streamline advanced hunts.</p><p>Soon after finishing that first hunt, we were dropped into a later point that did have more features unlocked, such as a mount with a second weapon, and allowed to hunt the Doshaguma, which has featured prominently in most of the game’s pre-release material. In an interesting change, the Doshaguma is actually a herd monster, and is surrounded by a pack of smaller versions of itself that are just as scrappy as the alpha. In what would turn out to be my favorite part of the preview, we had to actually fire large dung pods (yes, shit) from our slinger which exploded upon impact and sent the lesser Doshagumas scattering, isolating the leader. It’s a small but incredible touch that makes it feel like <em>Wilds </em>ecosystems really are as dense as they are billed and that every bit of it, including animal droppings, does in fact feed back into these intertwining environments.</p><p>With the Doshaguma backed into a corner, a tooltip suggested I fire an SOS flare, a mechanic that calls for players to join you in a multiplayer hunt, and gang up on the poor thing. Since my session was offline, I was instead immediately greeted by a full party of AI companions that admirably held their own and made fantastic use of their weapons and traps to aid me. Part-way through this really one-sided fight, the sky darkened, lightning began to come down, and the Doshaguma absconded into the darkness in a weakened state, where it probably hoped to escape any more hardship. Instead, it fled into the desert where it was greeted by a Rey Dau, a wyvern that spews lightning and did the job of weakening the Doshaguma with aplomb for me. After narrowly surviving the run-in with the apex predator of the region, the Doshaguma finally fell to a few more blows once I followed it back into a small cave. </p><p>All the while, <em>Wilds </em>was also the most seamless time I’ve had in one of these titles. A new dynamic healing option in the radial menu made it so that I didn’t have to dig through my item pouch for the right potion while the Doshaguma treated me like a chew toy. After wrapping up my second hunt, which more or less ended the planned bit of the preview, all the materials I picked up were sent to my storage and I was set loose on the Windward Plains, rather than being sent back to the village. I tracked down a second Chatacabra, changed to the light bowgun from my mount, and took it on just to see how quickly I could acclimate to a weapon I don’t typically use. The transition was buttery smooth, and I triumphed over the monster in no time. I did so well I actually had time to even track down the sandworm monster that plagued the kid in the game’s opening, known as a Balahara, and though I didn’t get to finish the fight, it was funny to watch it run into <em>another </em>Rey Dau. That thing just can’t stop inserting itself into beef!<br></p><p>I’m already dying to get back to those windswept dunes and see what further monster interactions I can find and exploit. I can’t wait to get more time with Focus mode on all the weapons and learn what the best loadouts are based on the monster I’m hunting.I’m excited at the prospect of apparently seamless multiplayer (and in the absence of that, competent AI companions) in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, especially since revisiting <em>World </em>recently reminded me of what a pain in the ass it could be. I’ve rarely left a preview so effusive, but <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>genuinely impressed me at just about every turn. Sure, it had some technical hitches, but given its ambitions, I don’t see how an in-progress build of the game wouldn’t have some small issues. On just about every other level though, <em>Wilds </em>is more than just solid, it’s immense. It cannot get here soon enough. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/VancityReynolds/status/1828411571665612988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/VancityReynolds/status/1828411571665612988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short scene</a></span> posted to X (formerly Twitter) on August 27, we see Tatum’s Gambit walk through the aftermath of a big battle and turn around toward the camera where we see a universe-hopping portal reflected in his eyes. These portals, dubbed Marvel Sparkle Circles by Deadpool, are the way characters traverse the cinematic multiverse, meaning that Gambit could make his way into the MCU proper. In a follow-up tweet Reynolds noted that a version of this scene can be seen in the movie on one of the TVA screens but that it was too small to notice the portal.</p><p>Gambit getting another chance would be a big win for fans and Tatum. If you don’t know, there is a lot of history and crushed dreams behind Tatum’s performance as Gambit. The actor was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://uproxx.com/hitfix/channing-tatum-i-almost-played-gambit-in-x-men-the-last-stand/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://uproxx.com/hitfix/channing-tatum-i-almost-played-gambit-in-x-men-the-last-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">originally slated</a></span> to appear as the beloved X-Men character way back in 2006’s <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> before being written out of the script. Later, when 2009’s <em>X-Men: Origins: Wolverine</em> was in production, Tatum was not available, so the role went to Taylor Kitsch. In May 2014, Tatum signed on to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/channing-tatum-gambit-movie-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/channing-tatum-gambit-movie-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gambit </em>standalone film</a></span> but that movie was stuck in development hell before being officially canceled in 2019 after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox. Tatum clearly has a passion for the character, and that movie remains one of the biggest what-if projects in Marvel cinematic history that fans constantly wish could have seen the light of day. His appearance in<em> Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> finally gave Tatum the chance to show off his take on the character, and it absolutely rocks. </p><p>The hope of this deleted scene is that <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> won’t be the end of Tatum’s tenure as Gambit, and that he could find his way into the larger MCU. With the appearance of the X-Men in the MCU only being a matter of time, it would make a lot of fans happy if Tatum could be part of that. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spectre Divide wrapped up a positive closed beta phase just days ago, and now the team at Mountaintop has confirmed that the game will be released worldwide (in early access) on PC on September 3rd. The recent beta might have been closed, but sharing gameplay and talking about the all-new competitive shooter was very much open, allowing potential fans to form early opinions.</p>



<p>This 3-vs-3 competitive shooter has been created with esports in mind, with the likes of Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek lending his professional expertise to the game’s development. It’s a unique enough premise, and it’s expected that it’ll do well once it hits the open market on September 3rd.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-two">Becoming Two</h2>



<p>Spectre Divide’s unique concept is that players can control two bodies – one tangible, the other a ‘Spectre’. In every mode, players are free to use these bodies as they see fit, and if their ‘fleshy’ character dies, they’re left to control their Spectre. </p>



<p>It’s comparable to Valorant in how it looks and plays, but it leans on traditional ADS gunplay to encourage a little more arcade-like play. With an individual art style inspired by retro cel animation and Japanese anime, Spectre Divide looks phenomenal on-screen, but it’s in the gameplay where this competitive shooter excels.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide will be released with four maps, twenty weapons, and both ranked and casual playlists. It’ll also support weekly competitions. It’s a free-to-play game but it <strong>is </strong>supported by cosmetics-based MTX, which is more or less the standard operating system now.</p>



<p>Are you going to be playing Spectre Divide when it’s released on September 3rd?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Echoes Act 3 adds a few new guns to Destiny 2, including Chronophage, a new Void trace rifle that's built for disintegrating enemies. It's a solid alternative to some other, tougher-to-get trace rifles, like the Rise of Nightmare raid's Acasia's Dejection. The Chronophage god roll is especially good in PvE, with a few perks that are great for synergistic Void builds to keep you shielded and happy as you zap your way through hordes of opponents.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Chronophage">How To Get Chronophage</a></li><li><a href="#Chronophage_God_Rolls">Chronophage God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Chornopage_PvE_God_Roll">Chornopage PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Chronophage_PvP_God_Roll">Chronophage PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Chronophage">How To Get Chronophage</h2><p dir="ltr">The launch of Echoes Act 3 adds Chronophage to the episode's loot pool, meaning you'll start to see it drop from Echoes activities: Breach Executable, Enigma Protocol, and Battlegrounds. The gun can also come from Echoes Engrams you'll earn all over the solar system, but in order to focus those engrams into Chronopage when you visit Failsafe, you'll need to complete new Nessus Specimen quests to unlock its focusing upgrade. Like the other guns from Echoes, Chronophage is craftable, so you can get it with your pick of enhanced perks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357880-destiny2chronophage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357880" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357880-destiny2chronophage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357880"></a><figcaption>Chronophage</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357880-destiny2chronophage.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chronophage_God_Rolls">Chronophage God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Chornopage_PvE_God_Roll">Chornopage PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: Stability +7, Range +7</li><li dir="ltr">Fluted Barrel: +5 Stability, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace / Shoot To Loot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Repulsor Brace: Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li><li dir="ltr">Shoot to Loot: Shooting an Orb of Power picks it up.

The combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds is always great in a weapon for clearing small enemies, particularly if you're running a Void build, since you get to turn enemies Volatile while constantly creating an overshield for yourself as you rack up kills. Chronophage also includes the Echoes origin trait Radiolaria Transposer, which combines well with any set of perks that let you kill a lot of enemies quickly, as multikills cause targets to explode and create pools of radiolaria on the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not looking for Void synergy, Shoot to Loot can keep your trace rifle firing for longer, and Target Lock takes advantage of the beam's requirement of melting a single target to boost its damage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Chronophage_PvP_God_Roll">Chronophage PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +7, Range +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Elemental Capacitor  <ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Substantially increases stats based on the currently equipped Super.<br>[Solar] increases your reload speed.<br>[Arc] increases handling.<br>[Void] increases stability.<br>[Stasis] moderately controls recoil and increases movement speed when aiming down sights.<br>[Strand] increases airborne effectiveness.</p></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Desperate Measures  <ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Weapon final blows grant bonus damage for an improved duration.

If you must take it into the Crucible, aim for both the range and stability stats to make the gun effective as far away as possible, and to keep your aim on target as much as possible. For perks, Elemental Capacitor gives you solid bonuses based on whatever subclass you're running and is particularly good if you choose Solar, and Desperate Measures can give you a damage bonus without too much difficulty in activating it, which should help you win two-on-one engagements more often.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a>-a-like 4v4 multiplayer shooter is transitioning from a premium title to a free-to-play game on 4th October, just eight months after its initial release.
</p>
<p>
Square announced the news in a <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/news.php?id=19278&amp;la=1&amp;n=2&amp;drt=1724734800&amp;tag=87d9005e3aa0690a5e94dc228934fdabf6edcc4a&amp;s=31">brief update on its support website</a>, noting the game - which remains a PlayStation exclusive after its free-to-play transition - will no longer require a PlayStation Plus subscription to play from 4th October.
</p>
<p>
Players that purchase Foamstars prior to its price change in October will receive a Legacy Gift set providing "exclusive" in-game items, including 12 colour-variant Bubble Beastie skins, one Slide Board design, and the "Legacy" title. "Your continued support of Foamstars would be greatly appreciated", Square adds.

<p>
Foamstars initially released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 back in February this year, sporting a £24.99 price tag - although Square attempted to give its player base an early boost by giving the game away as part of a PlayStation Plus subscription at launch.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, early reviews were a little tepid. Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin called Foamstars a "serviceable paintballer... lathered with some wild lore and underwhelming hero shooter elements" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-review">review</a>, asking, "What does it say about this shooter if the... character details are more entertaining than the 10-minute shooting galleries that precede them?"

		<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land has been announced today by Koei Tecmo, during the Nintendo Direct. While it was shown on Nintendo’s show, Atelier Yumia is not a Switch exclusive, with Koei Tecmo confirming that the game will be released on PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. The Xbox versions mark the first time the series has been available on Microsoft’s consoles.</p>

<p>Outside of the teaser trailer, nothing has really been detailed about the game. But, the development team at Gust will be hosting a livestream on September 2nd that is going to go into detail about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. The stream will be happening at 13:00 BST, and it will be streamed in Japanese only.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/">Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Atelier game we reviewed was Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, and in that review Miguel said,<em> “Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It’s incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours. I’m excited to see how ideas from this remake come forward to inspire whatever this series has in store for us next.”</em></p>

<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release in 2025.</p>
