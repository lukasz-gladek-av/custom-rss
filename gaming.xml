            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced a new board game set in the world of Exandria. The new board game, <em>A Familiar Find</em>, is all about the loyal animal companions going on an adventure on behalf of their summoner.</p><h2>Critical Role's <em>A Familiar Find</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>According to an official <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/afamiliarfind/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on Darrington Press' website, A Familiar Find is a fast-paced strategic card game. In the game, players take on the roles of magical familiars charged with an important task by their arcane master.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>That task is to find rare magical ingredients across the land of Exandria. To that end, you will explore ever-shifting magical locations, seek and collect magical components, and try to stay one step ahead of rivals attempting to sabotage you. Those rivals will set traps, call your bluff, and attempt to ruin any strategies you implement. Thankfully, you can utilize your own wits and magical spells to vex them as well.</p><p><em>A Familiar Find</em> is designed for up to four players. Each copy of the game contains a rulebook, over 84 Arcane Cards, 13 Location Cards which contain various game-changing effects, and ten playable familiars complete with their own unique character boards. The first player to either collect a full set of ingredients or three Astral Essence cards is declared the winner.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-campaign-4-episode-1-review-fascinating-narrative-frame-glorious" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> fans may recognize a few of the playable options. They include Trinket, the armored bear from Campaign 1 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, the Wildfire Spirit Monkey, Mister, and the reanimated rat Pate de Rolo are from Campaign 3.</p><p>Curiously, <em>A Familiar Find</em> doesn't feature any companions from Campaign 2. Sprinkle the Crimson Weasel and Nugget The Blink Dog, two of Jester's pets from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-mighty-nein-season-1-review-but-theres-only-eight-episodes-of-you" rel="nofollow">The Mighty Nein</a>, aren't mentioned.

It's another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> dev vlog, this time one with a big focus on multiplayer. This ability to play with, heaven forbid, other people is one that developer Unknown Worlds very much understands is not for everyone, given the first game's big focus on isolation and ruffing it yourself. So, this vlog is all about explaining why you don't need to worry if you like to go solo. And also to show off a dive elevator.
</p>
<p>
In the video, lead engineer Jon Bjarnason noted how the very first internal demos the studio held only a few weeks after development were multiplayer, and that "every single feature that we made since then has been multiplayer capable." But, as design lead Anthony Gallegos explained, "The important distinction there is that any part of the game isn't going to require cooperative play. If I want to come along and bring a friend, they can totally participate with me in every moment along the way. We never wanted to encroach on someone's game that just is like, 'I want to play solo.'"

<p>
Essentially, co-op is entirely optional through every aspect of the game, it's just that every aspect of the game also has co-op in mind. This stretches right through to things like animations too, as now other people can see your whole human body, so limbs and the like need to work properly, something that Brandt Beach, who I'm making sure to mention by name because it's funny his name is Beach and he's working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, says is more work, but worthwhile.
</p><p>
There's also that snazzy new dive elevator, which is as literal as it sounds, a fancy doohicky you hold onto to help you dive down deep into the depths. "The Dive Elevator just adds a lot to co-op in general," lead gameplay engineer Adrian Lopez-Mobilia explains. "I realized that it would be really cool to be able to both go with friends on it, but also to be able to attach stuff to it. So, as we started developing the prototype we realised that that would make it even more meaningful. Be able to load it up and then shoot it down to the depths and then come back with all the stuff you collected down there."
</p>
<p>
It also sounds like they're trying to make playing with your friends as easy as possible, as you'll have the option to invite folks to play either through your platform of choice's friends list, or through an in-game one for cross-play functionality. A big emphasis was placed on being able to play the game anywhere too, as a whole team is apparently devoted just to optimising the game for handheld devices like the Steam Deck apparently.
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that Subnautica 2 is also a slightly contentious game at the moment, given that the ex-leads of the game are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">suing publisher Krafton</a> after being ousted from the company, ultimately leading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">Unknown Worlds themselves to sue these former execs in kind</a>. A tad messy! So throw an appropriate amount of caution to the wind here.

              <p><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs are assessing the damage from an ongoing duplication glitch before it decides how to respond. T<a href="https://kotaku.com/all-of-besiege-beaten-with-a-single-perfect-machine-1688320789">en years later</a>, <em>Besieged</em> still has new content coming. And <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> isn’t skimping on its fighting game roster at launch. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>The voice actor from <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, Bryan Dechart, might be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitron.bsky.social/post/3mehke7eta22r">teasing fans with the threat</a> of a sequel. Quantic Dream has announced a live service MOBA called <i>Spellcasters Chronicles </i>and a <em>Star Wars</em> game called <em>Star Wars Eclipsed</em>, but it’s now been almost eight years since it last shipped something. Maybe in the Detroit sequel the humans will try to become AI instead of the other way around. Or maybe Dechart is just trying to get <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/2020873211286528029">more subscribers on Twitch</a>.</p>   <h2>A duplication glitch taking over <em>Arc Raiders</em> gets an emergency fix</h2> <p>Embark Studios has been playing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r0x0i7/just_a_heads_up_before_you_check_the_patch_notes/">whack-a-mole with this exploit</a> for a couple weeks now and it’s taking its toll. Players can essentially duplicate any item in the game that their character can hold, leading to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qq36np/12m_loot_in_one_raid_killed_a_guy_with_this_loot/">inventory screens</a> that all look hacked. Today’s big &nbsp;1.15.0 patch didn’t have anything about it, but Embark ended up rushing out a hotfix just hours later.</p>

 <p>“We have just pushed a hotfix to resolve the current duplication issue. We are still actively monitoring the situation to ensure we’ve covered all cases – should you encounter other duplication issues, please raise them to us in the bug report channel,” the development team wrote on Discord. “We are still investigating the full impact of the issue, and will be taking action based on the severity of the different cases as we complete our investigation.”</p> <h2>A group of <em>Valheim</em> devs have a demo for their next game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMxYZAlpPU"><em>Begraved</em> is a medieval PVE looter</a> from some of the developers who made the hit Viking survival crafting sim. Think a coop dungeon crawler with extraction shooter elements. It now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113160/Begraved/">a free demo</a> for players to try on Steam ahead of its upcoming Early Access launch.</p>

 <h2>Hit medieval destruction sim <em>Besiege</em> goes to space</h2>  <p>The unusual physics sandbox arrived a decade ago, only hit 1.0 on Steam five years ago, and is still heading to new frontiers. Besiege: The Broken Beyond will hit Steam sometime around mid-2026 and add a new campaign, environment, mechanics, and blocks.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> will feature 20 comic book characters</h2> <p>That number l<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-tokon-steams-page-has-been-updated-revealing-roster-size-20-characters-at-launch-single-player-mode-64-player-lobbies-psn-acc-required.1430548/">eaked on Steam</a> ahead of this week’s PlayStation Showcase. <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384">Arc System Works’ riff on the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> formula</a> has already confirmed eight of its roster members, including Captain America, Doom, and Iron Man. It’s very light on X-Men at the moment so maybe the upcoming State of Play will reveal Magneto and others are joining the fray.</p> <h2><em>Until Dawn</em> studio Supermassive reveals a new release date for its next game</h2> <p>Upcoming horror release Directive 8020 was supposed to be out last year but ended up getting a long delay. It’s now resurfaced with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61OMILUgVyo">a new trailer</a> and a May 12 launch date. Hopefully it marks a turn around from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/18/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-interactive-has-reportedly-laid-off-45-people">the very rough last few years</a> the studio’s been through.</p>

 <h2>A <em>Marathon</em> hands-on leak out of China sounds very positive</h2> <p>Bungie’s extraction shooter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0wp7k/marathon_handson_event_in_china_impressions_leaked/">reportedly had a recent test event there</a> that went very well. General impressions summarized in a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JCcPzYEov/">video posted on Bilibili</a> suggest a lot more depth and tension than the original alpha test in early 2025 conveyed. We’ll probably get a closer look at the world building and lore in a new State of Play trailer this week.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">How did Super Bowl ads get so cringe?&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-thing-about-the-winter-olympics-are-the-drone-cameras-2000666958">The best thing about the Winter Olympics are the drone cameras</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865">The latest roguelike from Binding of Isaac’s creator is a brilliantly poopy take on strategy&nbsp;</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Get ready to take over the career of the “Best in the World” CM Punk in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming reported several weeks ago that CM Punk, the WWE 2K26 cover star, was planned to be the focal point of this year’s WWE 2K Showcase. Now, 2K has confirmed the news and is giving fans a deep dive into what to expect this year and the different paths to unlock all Showcase content.</p>







<h2 id="h-get-punked-in-wwe-2k26-showcase">Get Punked in WWE 2K26 Showcase</h2>



<p>WWE 2K not only released a written <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> on the forthcoming mode, but also a new trailer narrated by the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion, who breaks down how players can relive his history in some matches and rewrite it in others.</p>



<p>The mode, taking a page from last year’s Showcase, kicks off with a match from this year’s WrestleMania, putting players in the middle of the action between Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns, and CM Punk. Other historical bouts include John Cena, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar, and more. Check out the full list of historical matches below:</p>



<ul>
<li>CM Punk vs. JBL, SummerSlam 2008</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Rey Mysterio, Armageddon 2008</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Randy Orton, WrestleMania 27</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Undertaker, WrestleMania 29</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. John Cena, RAW Feb. 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. The Rock, Elimination Chamber 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs Brock Lesnar, SummerSlam 2013</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre, Bad Blood 2024</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Seth Freakin’ Rollins, RAW Jan. 2025</li>



<li>CM Punk vs. Seth Freakin’ Rollins vs. Roman Reigns, WrestleMania 41</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also three announced “Fantasy Warfare” scenarios. One match sees CM Punk take on Steve Austin. Another sees CM Punk facing off against Eddie Guerrero. The last sees CM Punk teaming up with his wife, AJ Lee, to do battle with The Miz and Maryse. These all take place in a fantasy arena called the “CM Punkvillion.”</p>



<p>Lastly, there are the what-if scenarios. These include matches that ask questions such as “What if CM Punk never left WWE in 2014?” and “What if certain rivalries went differently?”</p>

<h2>Players Can Choose to Run the Gauntlet Instead</h2>



<p>For anyone who wants to unlock all the content associated with WWE 2K26’s Showcase mode, players can simply run the Gauntlet instead. In this mode, you can choose either CM Punk or AJ Lee and try to beat 20 consecutive opponents. In any case, there is a wealth of content to be unlocked.</p>



<p>Speaking of unlockables, this year’s game introduces a new Ringside Pass system. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">this link.</a></p>

		<p>Developer Multiverse has announced that it is delaying Pax Autocratica’s early access release date again. It was originally scheduled for February 2nd, then moved to March 4th. Now, the release date has been set for May 7th, meaning an additional two month delay. The reason is that from further internal testing, the studio has decided it needs more time before the colony builder and FPS roguelite hybrid is ready.</p>

<p>In a statement the developer Multiverse highlighted three particular areas for improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Early Experience &amp; Onboarding – Final adjustments to how new citizens are introduced to core systems, improving early-game flow, clarity, and pacing based on player feedback.</em></li>
<li><em>Core Systems Polish &amp; Balance – Light tuning across progression, base building, and management systems to incorporate requested quality-of-life improvements and ensure a smoother, more consistent experience.</em></li>
<li><em>Performance &amp; Stability – Ongoing optimization and bug fixing to address reported performance issues, edge cases, and crashes before Early Access authorization.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>

<p>On <strong>17th February 2026</strong>, owners of the Nintendo Switch versions of both games will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Editions for free. And if you have the newer console, why wouldn't you? The price for the Switch 2 Edition straight-up hasn't been announced.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, you'll be able to play both games and 1440p and 60fps docked, while handheld is bumped to 1080p and 60fps. You all want to see some terrifying sea creatures in crisp, shiny visuals in the dark now, don't you? *shudders*</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vtkxyq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Controls have also been "optimized" for Switch 2, so perhaps there's some Mouse Mode integration there?</p>
<p>Both Subnautica games arrived on Switch 1 back in May 2021 and we enjoyed both of them a lot — though the first game <em>just</em> edges out Below Zero for us. If you've never played them before, then make sure you have a read of our reviews, <em>and</em> check out the rundown from the games' eShop page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining the award-winning game Subnautica with its sequel Subnautica Below Zero, this Nintendo Switch™ exclusive allows players to fully immerse themselves in the full mystery surrounding the water world of planet 4546B.</p>
<p>Craft equipment, pilot submarines and out-smart wildlife to explore lush coral reefs, volcanoes, cave systems, and more - all while trying to survive in both hostile water zones and frozen terrain.</p>
<p>Features:<br>
- Survival Is Key: Gather valuable materials, craft tools, manage your hunger and thirst, all while evading the dangerous wildlife that sees you as its next meal<br>
- Crash Landing on Planet 4546B: Beneath the serene waves of this aquatic planet are clues around its complicated history and how it warps the lives for all those that crash land there<br>
- Exploration: Delve into unique aquatic and terrain biomes that will unlock not only materials, but the answers that you seek<br>
- Build Your Habitat: Crafting and building the comforts of home here. These bases will be integral for your survival from not only the wildlife, but also the harsh environment around you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sequel, <strong>Subnautica 2</strong>, is due to come to Early Access 2026, but Switch 2 isn't one of the slated platforms for it.</p>
<p>Plus, the sequel's publisher Krafton (who acquired the dev in 2022) and Unknown Worlds are embroiled in a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">rather messy lawsuit</a>. Krafton has also attracted additional negative attention after it announced it was working on becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">an "AI first" company</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>According to two separate and trustworthy sources, <strong>Microsoft</strong> is reportedly considering the merging of the <strong>Xbox Game Pass Premium</strong> console subscription tier with <strong>PC Game Pass</strong>. The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> that the plans are far from finalized, but that's what Microsoft is thinking right now, and Windows Central has subsequently <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-plans-to-expand-xbox-game-pass-and-merge-pc-game-pass-with-another-tier-more-third-party-service-bundles-may-be-on-the-way-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed up the reporting</a> with its own sources.</p>



<p>Here's a breakdown of the respective feature sets as they are currently available to users:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Feature</th><th data-align="left">PC Game Pass</th><th data-align="left">Xbox Game Pass Premium</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Price</strong></td><td data-align="left">$11.99/month</td><td data-align="left">$14.99/month</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Platforms</strong></td><td data-align="left">PC only</td><td data-align="left">Console, PC, Cloud</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>First-Party Day-One Access</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No (added within 1 year)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>EA Play Included</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Cloud Gaming</strong></td><td data-align="left">No</td><td data-align="left">Yes (unlimited)​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></td><td data-align="left">N/A (PC only)</td><td data-align="left">Yes (on console)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Game Library Size</strong></td><td data-align="left">Full PC catalog</td><td data-align="left">~200 games</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Merging Xbox Game Pass Premium with PC Game Pass likely means the new tier would include <strong>cloud gaming, EA Play, and first-party day-one access</strong>, arguably the three primary features of Game Pass. Of course, <strong>it's most likely going to cost slightly more</strong> if this plan goes through. It's hard to take a guess, but perhaps somewhere around $17-18.</p>



<p>At that point, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <strong>could really need more bundled third-party services to boost its value</strong>. Indeed, that's the other half of Warren's rumor, though he does not share any specifics on which ones. <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong> and <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> are already included <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since October's big restructuring</a>, so it would have to be something else. Do you reckon Microsoft should go forward with this merger plan, or would you rather things stay as they are? Let us know in the comments below.</p>



<p>In related Xbox news, it seems like the next-generation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2027</a></strong>, but Microsoft hasn't fully committed to that yet. Most sources agree <strong>it's going to be a console/PC hybrid</strong> that runs PC apps and will even have different SKUs from other OEMs like ASUS.</p>

              <p>Norwegian Olympic athlete Sturla Holm Lægreid wasn’t celebrating when he won a bronze medal at the ongoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-thing-about-the-winter-olympics-are-the-drone-cameras-2000666958">2026 Winter Olympics in Italy</a>. Instead, he broke down on live TV and confessed to cheating on his girlfriend three months before.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nrk.no/ol/sturla-holm-laegreid-innrommer-utroskap-pa-direkten_-_-mitt-livs-storste-tabbe-1.17763479">On February 10, as first reported by </a><em><a href="https://www.nrk.no/ol/sturla-holm-laegreid-innrommer-utroskap-pa-direkten_-_-mitt-livs-storste-tabbe-1.17763479">Norwegian Broadcasting Company (NRK)</a>,</em> shortly after <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/norway-and-france-top-podium-mens-biathlon-20km-individual">Sturla won a bronze medal in the men’s 20km biathlon,</a> he was interviewed about his accomplishment. And it was during this interview that Lægreid pivoted to confessing to recently cheating on his girlfriend, losing her, and being miserable.</p>

 <p>“There is someone I wanted to share this with who might not be watching today,” said Sturla in a post-event interview. “Six months ago, I met the love of my life, the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life and was unfaithful.” He said he’d admitted a week ago to cheating and added, “This has been the worst week of my life.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="no" dir="ltr">Så ikke helt denne komme. Tidenes mest absurde medaljeintervju. 🫣 <a href="https://t.co/fFwJ1B0vCO">pic.twitter.com/fFwJ1B0vCO</a></p> <p>— Daniel Vassbund (@Smoothedan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Smoothedan/status/2021231796759748765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span dir="auto">“I want to be a good role model, but I just have to admit when I make mistakes. </span><span dir="auto">It hurts to admit when you do something you can’t stand for and hurt someone you love so much. But that’s life now.”</span></p>

 <p>So why did Sturla admit to cheating on his girlfriend at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/winter-olympics-injecting-penis-acid-skiing-real-men-ski-jumping-cheating-2000666137">Winter Olympics</a> right after winning a medal? Well, in a follow-up inteview with <em>NRK</em>, the skiier explained it was his attempt at possibly getting her back.</p> <p>“I have nothing to lose. I had a chance at true love, and I screwed up so badly. It’s not necessarily forgivable. But if this gives me a tiny chance to tell her how much I love her, I’d rather commit social suicide on live TV just to get that little chance,” said Strula.</p>

 <p>When the reporter pointed out that he just aired their private situation publicly to the world, he seemed to realize this was probably not the best choice, replying: “Maybe I messed up my chance now to get her back.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-launches-next-week/</link>
            <guid>1431463</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s second season officially launches on February 17, and the action is headed to Germany.</p>



<p>The news was announced via the official drop of a gameplay trailer on February 10. However, the trailer had leaked earlier, revealing that the action centers on the seizure of Hagental Airbase in Bravia.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-launches-with-new-map">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Launches With New Map</h2>



<p>Two maps will launch next season. The first of which is called “Contaminated.” <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA previously stated</a> that the map size falls between Eastwood and Mirak Valley and is comparable to classic Battlefield maps such as St. Quentin Scar from Battlefield 1 or Arras from Battlefield 5. The map is also supposedly designed to specifically address time-to-action concerns.</p>



<p>In the same blog post, EA tells fans that Golmud Railway, a popular map from Battlefield 4, is being rebuilt for modern Battlefield and will be available in a future season.</p>







<h2>Battlefield 6 Has Been a Financial Success</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of 2025. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-ea-sales/">EA’s NET bookings increased</a> 38% year over year, driven by the success of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Despite this strong start, player numbers have declined due to a lack of post-launch content. Perhaps the launch of season 2 can turn that around.</p>

More like space the final funtier am I right (cue canned laughter that goes on a touch too long)? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a>, the physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building game</a> about building all manner of medieval machinery to destroy your enemy, has taken you to all kinds of lands and with its 2024 expansion, The Splintered Sea, a few oceans too. But with its newly revealed follow-up expansion, there's nowhere to go but up (because it's set in space, hence my absolutely hilarious opening line).
</p>
<p>
This next expansion, only sort of shown off in a brief teaser trailer, is called "The Broken Beyond," and sees you doing your usual thing of putting some wood and metal together until you've got something that could wipe out an army, but against aliens this time. "Put your engineering talents to the test as you master space flight, navigating gravitational fields, avoiding asteroids and other challenges using a suite of exciting new blocks," the expansion's Steam page description explains.

There's a new campaign to play through where you'll head to different planets, build some spacecrafts, and presumably make a space catapult. You'll also find new space themed blocks, a new sandbox to play around with, and suitably, some new physics mechanics. Details are slim aside from that, but I'm quite tickled by the commitment to sticking with that medieval aesthetic even in the far corners of the galaxy. It's certainly not a vibe for those who are particular about anachronisms, but to them I say find a different hobby.
</p><p>
The expansion doesn't have a release date as of yet, though its trailer says it should be coming in Q2 this year, so you don't have all that long to wait ultimately. And if you like, you can add it to your infinitely growing Steam wishlist right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639470/Besiege_The_Broken_Beyond/">here</a>.

So if you have a subscription and still haven’t gotten around to Insomniac’s latest open-world superhero romp, it sounds like you’ll be able to play it soon for free.</span></p> <p><span>Though Sony hasn’t announced it yet, </span><i><span>Dealabs</span></i><span> says that </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Neva </span></i><span>will be part of February’s PlayStation Plus offerings. </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>is obviously the headliner, and it’s also coming to the service at a pretty opportune time, as the next game in Insomniac’s Marvel universe is imminent. </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer-ps5-release-date-bloody-2000628275"><span>is coming to PS5</span></a><span> later this year and while it won’t star Peter Parker and Miles Morales, it will take place in the same shared universe, so there will likely be a nod or two to the Spider-Men’s stories.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>launched on PS5 in 2023, then came to PC </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-pc-steam-psn-login-nycc-2024-ps5-1851676683"><span>a little under two years later</span></a><span>. The sequel stars both Peter and Miles as playable characters, and sets up a potential third game that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-spider-man-yuri-lowenthal-ice-alex-pretti-2000663563"><span>actor Yuri Lowenthal</span></a> <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive"><span>confirmed is in the works</span></a><span>. The first two games, </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</span></i><span>, are both part of the PlayStation Plus catalog if you have an Extra or Premium membership, so the whole series will be available to you if you’re a subscriber.</span></p> <p><span>We’ll probably get official confirmation from Sony this week, especially with the State of Play presentation </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-sony-marvel-wolverine-release-date-2000666866"><span>scheduled for Thursday</span></a><span>. I can already see them showing off new footage of </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>, giving that game a release date, and being like, “Hey, you can play all of Insomniac’s other Marvel games now on PlayStation Plus.” Brand synergy, ya know?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, that didn't take too long! After launching on the Switch eShop back in December, Dotemu and Tribute Games have today updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> to ver. 1.0.5, bundling in a fresh batch of hero colour palettes to boot.</p>
<p>The 'Cosmic Collabs' update includes a new wardrobe option for 12 of the 15-hero roster, each inspired by a different Marvel game. Spider-Man and Venom each get a crossover fit from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Black Panther and Rocket Racoon take theirs from <strong>Marvel Snap</strong> art, She-Hulk and Wolverine's new looks come from <strong>Marvel Strike Force</strong>, Captain America and Nova take inspiration from <strong>Marvel Future Fight</strong>, Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill's palettes are all about <strong>Marvel Contest of Champions</strong>, and even <strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest</strong> gets a nod in Storm and Iron Man's fresh threads.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The update also includes its fair share of bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and new features, so you can be sure things are running smoother than ever before as you put these new palettes to the test.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753970?emclan=103582791475080003&amp;emgid=519737782627731794">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion Ver. 1.0.5 (10th Feb 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Epic MARVEL Games Collaborations!</strong></h3>
<p>We’re bringing in tributes to our favourite MARVEL Games experiences, including palettes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Rivals</strong></em> - Spider-Man and Venom</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Snap</strong></em> - Black Panther and Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Strike Force</strong></em> - She-Hulk and Wolverine</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Future Fight</strong></em> - Captain America and Nova</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Contest of Champions</strong></em> - Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Puzzle Quest</strong></em> - Storm and Iron Man</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New Features!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hero Lab Upgrades</strong> - with new palette previews to help you get a great view of new cosmetic options, and a new Team Level indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Tweaked Arcade Modifiers</strong> - swinging into danger with modifications. The Double HP modifier is now an HP Multiplier - where enemy HP can now be multiplied by 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 times their standard amount!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Improvements!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of visual changes based on your feedback, designed to make it easier for you to keep up with the on-screen action, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroes will now be highlighted when HP is low</li>
<li>The Focus bar has been split to make it easier to read</li>
<li>Special Damage number visuals have been changed to red - making them easier to identify</li>
<li>The Heteropteron Level Larva Bug has been tweaked to make the enemy stand out. In addition, we’ve added flashes on the Larva during throw animations and introduced colour cycling effects on the attack!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also taken some time to go back for further balancing on boss fights, tweaking these to provide a little more fair play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hela</strong> - Increasing cooldowns for both Grudge and Hellblades attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Venom</strong> - Reducing block and parry actions and removing combo parry, increasing reaction cooldown, lowering damage on the Bite attack and removing some post-Grudge attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Phyla-Vell</strong> - Reducing block actions and lowering chance of using Cosmic Attack. We’ve also added cooldown on some attacks, increased the cooldown on cosmic Fury and lengthened the initial block action to prevent instant parry.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></h3>

<p>Marvel Rivals is ready to launch Season 6.5. A new hero joins the action, Team-Up abilities change, and more.</p>



<p>Launching on February 13, Elsa Bloodstone will join the action as a Duelist. The news was announced in a social media video presented by GuangGuang from the development team.</p>

<h2 id="h-changes-to-the-team-up-abilities-in-marvel-rivals">Changes to the Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals</h2>

"I'm still playing now," he added. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/gettyimages-82648008-1770741008273.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ghost in the Shell director Mamoru Oshii. Image credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the appeal of Fallout 4 to Mamoru Oshii? The 74-year-old called it a "game that seems to have been made for my own desires," and described how he wanders the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world carrying a rifle and accompanied by the game's canine companion, Dogmeat.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Fallout 4, Oshi explains that he's also a big Hideo Kojima fan and plays every new game from the Metal Gear Solid creator — he recently finished playing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, in which he actually appears as an NPC known as The Pizza Chef. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for almost a decade, Oshi said he had followed a cycle where he breaks off from playing Fallout 4 to play Kojima's new game upon release, completes it, and then... returns back to Fallout 4 once more. "There are no other games I want to play," Oshii simply said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I once tried PUBG and racked up 250 hours," he casually noted, but said that he didn't really like online multiplayer games or first-person shooters that require quick reflexes. "They're not for me," he noted.  (He does recall taking a commemorative screenshot after getting a Chicken Dinner in PUBG, but only once.) "After all is said and done, I prefer playing games on my own," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fallout 4 is just right," he continued. "Although it's an action game, as people who play it will know — it has the VATS system." Fallout's slo-mo aiming system allows even people who are no good at aiming to land shots, he suggested. "If the game didn't have this, I probably couldn't play it." </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout 4 Next-Gen Update Makeshift Weapon Pack Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mamoru Oshii previously revealed in great detail to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yes-ghost-in-the-shells-director-is-obsessed-with-fallout-4-and-we-have-a-record-of-his-chaotic-escapades-in-the-game-penned-by-the-man-himself/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> that he has a rather eccentric way of playing Fallout 4 - that he doesn't ally with any factions, and has ignored the main storyline in favor of spending hours on side quests and raids with Dogmeat as his sole companion. His playstyle seems to be that of a community-minded lone wolf, stripping all the gear off raiders and gunners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a win-win," he noted, "I get to enjoy the pleasure of stripping scumbags naked while also contributing to the local community’s welfare." He's said that he is particularly hostile towards Brotherhood of Steel members (who he likens to Nazis) and always sneak kills whole units (at one point, he amassed so many Brotherhood of Steel Power Armors that he used them to build a moat). Back when he played on console, Oshii apparently gathered so much loot at his base that his PS4 struggled to run the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Around 4 years ago, I ran out of things to do (in Fallout 4)," Oshii explained. "So I installed mods." However, the Angel's Egg director noted that Fallout 4's new version (i.e. the 2025 Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition update) rendered his mods unusable. Upon launching Fallout 4 after the update, Oshii says that instead of his customized character, "some random bald guy wearing a suit suddenly appeared, and it took a lot of effort to get the game back to normal. I wish they'd stop changing things without asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

If you've had your eye on one of them (or all of them), now's a great time to pick them up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We found a lot to enjoy in all of the above games. Both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> earned 9s in their respective reviews from IGN's Jada Griffin. So what makes CrossWorlds stand out? It "fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster, excellent courses, and lengthy list of customization options." And as for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it "takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights with a creative Shadow campaign and an appreciable graphical upgrade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">Sonic Superstars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">Sonic Frontiers</a> each earned a 7 in their respective reviews. Griffin found that Sonic Superstars "has a mix of both interesting and ill-advised new ideas, making it an enjoyable Sonic game but not exactly a Super one." Sonic Frontiers was reviewed by writer Travis Northup, who said it's "an ambitious open-world adventure that mostly succeeds at mixing up the Sonic formula, even when some of its ideas fall flat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what kind of Sonic adventure you're looking to drop into, these offers seem well worth taking advantage of before they're gone.

Clearly, work has now begun on Fares' next game — and intriguingly, he seems to be doing his best to disguise who the actors are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With his arm outstretched and thumb raised, Fares is successfully blocking most of all three actors' faces — and this appears to be by design. "Next game in the making," Fares captioned the post, with a thumbs up emoji. "We're back in the kitchen, cookin' up something really delicious," the official Hazelight Studios social media account responded, adding: "Now with Strategic Arm Placement Tech."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>✌️We’re back in the kitchen, cookin’ up something really delicious! 🥘</p><p>Now with Strategic Arm Placement Tech®️</p></div>— Hazelight Studios (@HazelightGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/2021176093907009637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Fares' games have commented on the post to say they are suitably uncertain who the actors involved might be — though many more have noted the fact that Fares is using this first sneak peek to showcase <em>three </em>actors being visible. Could this signify a three-player game, after the studio's recent focus on titles featuring a pair of prominent characters?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Three-player Hazelight Game?" wondered one fan, Spenny99. "It Takes Three?????" questioned Jcbartlett25. "It Takes Three lookin great Mr. Fares," added hotpicklepizza.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-op adventure Split Fiction launched last year to rave reviews, and went on to sell more than 4 million copies. Its story focuses on a pair of writers, Zoe and Mio, who become trapped in their interweaving sci-fi and fantasy narratives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An expertly crafted co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of constantly refreshed gameplay ideas and styles – and one that’s very hard to walk away from," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction review</a>, awarding the game 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fares' previous game It Takes Two also proved popular, with its story focused on a husband and wife who plan to get a divorce. We called it "a beautiful, breakneck-paced, co-op adventure that’s bubbling over with creativity," in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-review">It Takes Two review</a>, which also returned a 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before that, Fares previously released prison escape adventure A Way Out, starring two convicts, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, starring... two sons. Should Fares actually be making a three-player game, it would indeed be a break from the norm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-so-do-you-prefer-hollow-knight-or-silksong</link>
            <guid>1431355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="afbb73de2ace7"><a title="Hollow Knight vs Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afbb73de2ace7/hollow-knight-vs-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite pledging that we'd take a break from games of this ilk when we finished pouring blood, sweat and tears into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> last year, Team Cherry has somehow found a way of dragging us back in with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, we put the halls of Hallownest behind us for good many years ago now, but the promise of buttery smooth performance had us flying back to it like a Markoth to a flame — <em>mmm, "additional effects"</em>. The more we played, the more we remembered just how much we love this world, these characters, this floaty little knight.</p>
<p>'Oh no,' we suddenly realised, ' without the performance argument in our arsenal, there's nothing stopping us from asking the ultimate question: do we prefer Hollow Knight or Silksong?'</p>
<p>When Silksong launched last year, it felt like a foregone conclusion. In this sequel, Team Cherry had done everything in its power to take what made the first game so wonderful, and make it even <em>wonderfuller</em>. Hornet is quicker and more acrobatic than the Knight. Her tools open more combat possibilities than we ever thought possible. The map makes Hallownest feel piddly.</p>
<p>We even said as much in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>: "It elevates map design and purposeful challenge effortlessly, and is an improvement on Hollow Knight in every single way." And yes, for reference, we <em>only</em> awarded its predecessor a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>But, returning to Hallownest on Switch 2 in recent days, our preference isn't quite as clean cut as it was back in September, when the long-awaited Silksong was still so shiny and new in our hands. The map may be smaller, but it feels just as dense. The overarching narrative of the fallen kingdom is sublimely woven into your surroundings, with a simplicity that's tough to knock. And can anything ever truly replicate the feeling of pure dread experienced with your first steps into Deepnest?</p>
<figure data-uuid="2ec88e322390e"><a title="Hollow Knight / Silksong Bench" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2ec88e322390e/hollow-knight-silksong-bench.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>So... come here often? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, there are voices for both sides of the argument here at Nintendo Life Towers, so we thought it was only right to throw it out to you, our lovely readers. Do Silksong's improvements leave it at the top spot in your mind, or is Hollow Knight still your number one? You can cast your <del>Zote</del> vote in the following poll.</p>

			<p>Later this week, <strong>Sony</strong> is set to host its first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a> </strong>event of 2026. This hour-long showcase will include several announcements we could guess at, and many we won't be able to, but a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has pretty much cemented one of the announcements that we'll see at Thursday's show (if we don't see it tomorrow): the games entering the <strong>PS Plus Extra Catalog</strong> for February 2026. Which, according to the report, will be headlined by <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</strong></p>



<p>The first of <strong>Insomniac's</strong> Spider-Man titles, <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> (the remastered variant, that is), entered the PS Plus Extra library of games <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">back in <strong>August 2025</strong></a>. With <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong> already included in the catalog, this means that players who sign up for the second tier of <strong>PlayStation's</strong> subscription service will be able to play all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games so far.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2 isn't the only game mentioned in the Dealabs report, as it also cites that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/neva-the-gris-follow-up-from-nomada-studio-receives-beautiful-new-gameplay-trailer/">Neva</a>,</strong> the follow-up to the critically acclaimed <strong>Gris</strong> from <strong>Nomada Studio</strong>, will enter the catalog alongside Spider-Man 2, as will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a></strong>.</p>

<p>There will undoubtedly be more games than just those three entering the catalog, but those are the only ones mentioned in the report. Normally, it's worth taking any leaks you see ahead of showcases like Thursday's upcoming State of Play with a grain of salt, but in this case, you'll want to add more salt to the pile. Dealabs and Billbil-kun have an extremely strong record of revealing PS Plus news ahead of time.</p>



<p>So, at least in this case, we can bet that we'll see Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Neva, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown as part of the PS Plus Extra games for February 2026.</p>



<p>PS Plus subscribers at every tier can already enjoy <strong>Undisputed, Ultros, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">PS Plus Essential games</a> for February 2026 (which, unsurprisingly, were leaked ahead of time by Dealabs).</p>
