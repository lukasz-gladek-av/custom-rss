            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>When Valve introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the Steam Deck OLED</a>, I called it “everything the original should have been.” Asus is trying to do the exact same thing with the new ROG Ally X. </p><div><p>After months of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167267/yes-i-can-confirm-this-is-the-rog-ally-x">leaks</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">teases</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">exclusive early details</a> from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">yours truly</a>, it’s official: the ROG Ally X handheld gaming PC is going on preorder today <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-ally-x-7-120hz-fhd-1080p-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-processor-1tb-black/6583218.p?skuId=6583218">for $799</a>.</p></div><p>When it ships on July 22nd, it’ll come with double the battery, double the storage, double the USB-C ports with quadruple the USB bandwidth, 50 percent more (and faster) 7500MHz memory for up to a 15 percent performance boost, dramatically revised ergonomics, an overhauled internal layout, and an extensive list of other tweaks. </p><div><p><figcaption>ROG Ally (top) vs. ROG Ally X (bottom).</figcaption></p></div><p>There are so many changes, in fact, that I spent two hours on the phone with Asus technical marketing director Sascha Krohn to hear about them all. I also went to the company’s US headquarters to open up an ROG Ally X with my own screwdrivers and play with the new build. I took plenty of pics, because I want you to nerd out with me. </p><p>But first, let me remind you what the ROG Ally X <em>is not</em>. Here’s what I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">last month</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Don’t call it an Ally 2: when it ships in the second half of the year, the Windows-based Ally X will have the same AMD Z1 Extreme chipset and the same 7-inch 48–120Hz VRR screen. It’s not quite like&nbsp;the Steam Deck OLED, where Valve got AMD to revise its chip for better battery life and stability and added a larger, brighter, gorgeous new OLED panel with improved response time and slimmer bezels.</p></blockquote></div><p>The ROG Ally X is a revision, not a sequel, and it’s a pricier one. It still runs Windows, and I still firmly believe Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20been%20almost%20a%20full%20year%20since%20Asus%20released%20the%20ROG%20Ally%20and%20over%20two%20years%20since%20the%20Steam%20Deck">drags gaming handhelds down</a>. But the Ally X might be the best Windows handheld yet — because Asus has crammed a monster 80 watt-hour battery into a handheld that <em>doesn’t feel </em>heavy, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">one that fits my average-sized hands better</a> than any Windows handheld I’ve tried. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->18</p><p><figcaption><em>Want to see some comparisons to the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck? Here’s a quick hardware tour:</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At 1.49 pounds (678g), the ROG Ally X is only 0.15 pounds (70g) heavier than the original, and it’s only 0.18 inches (4.5mm) thicker at its thickest point. It’s almost exactly the same weight as the original Steam Deck, and almost half an inch thinner, but with twice as much battery capacity inside. </p><p>How? While the bigger battery added over 120 grams of weight, Asus was able to offset half of it by making other components lighter. Krohn says a stronger, thinner, lighter chassis offered the biggest savings — the weight of the talcum-filled ABS / polycarbonate composite went from 176 grams to 134 grams by the time Asus was done. (I did run into one side effect of the stiffer plastic blend: it’s harder to pop it open for repair.)</p><p>The Ally X has lighter circuit boards, too, shaving away lots of unnecessary board, and a lighter cooling module — including 23-percent smaller fans that are actually <em>more</em> powerful, because the company’s in-house design team created its own custom set of 77 ultra-thin blades that trump the 47 of the original. Krohn says you might see the Ally run a couple degrees cooler, and the thinner blades help reduce the audible noise bump at around 5,000Hz, too. </p><p>And, there’s a new series of vents that let the Ally X cool its touchscreen more effectively — up to 6°C cooler.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->11</p><p><figcaption><em>Let’s tour the Ally X internals, starting with the 80Wh battery.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The joysticks are another place where they’re both better <em>and</em> lighter: completely revised modular boards now use the same high-grade potentiometer based ALPS sticks you’ll find in a PS5 or Xbox gamepad, with far tighter throw than the original Ally, delightfully tacky concave tops a la Steam Deck OLED, wider bases for better dust resistance, and low friction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene">POM plastic</a> stems for smoother action when they scrape against the joystick ring’s edge.</p><p>They’re rated to 5 million rotation cycles, up from 2 million, and if that’s not enough, they’re modular — ready for a drift-resistant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsBw3nxAzfY/">Hall Effect magnetic joystick upgrade kit</a> that Gulikit already has in development. (Krohn says not enough gamers prefer Hall Effect sticks for them to come standard, which... maybe?)</p><p>And, Asus has seemingly addressed almost all of the biggest complaints about I/O: </p><p>You get a full-length M.2 2280 PCIe 4 SSD slot now, one which supports double-sided drives too, opening up both the highest capacity and the most cost effective storage options on the market. </p><p>Asus has also ditched its proprietary XG Mobile eGPU port for a second USB-C port, one that offers all the benefits of Thunderbolt 4 too: 40Gbps speeds, 100W USB-C PD charging, DP 1.4 video output, and 4 lanes of PCIe for standard eGPUs. (No <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152087/ayaneo-plans-ornate-ag01-graphics-starship-egpu-dock">Oculink</a>, sorry.)</p><p>Both ports are top-mounted, but Krohn says that lets even the weaker one offer 100W charging and 10Gbps data.</p><div><p>And yes, Asus says you get a <em>new</em> SD card reader that is <em>not</em> the same as the one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20Asus%20still%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20that%20the%20Ally%E2%80%99s%20SD%20card%20reader%20ever%20had%20any%20fault">that Asus won’t admit has an issue</a>.</p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X one-pager. 24GB RAM means the GPU and system basically no longer need to share.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Here are some of the smaller details I learned:</p><div><ul><li>The D-pad is not only eight-way now, it’s also larger and more comfortable. I vastly prefer it.</li><li>The face buttons are 3mm taller, inside a longer tube for more stability. I found they have a flatter press.</li><li>The speakers have a slightly larger chamber for slightly more volume and bass.</li><li>The haptic actuators have moved to the edges of the device, beneath palms, for more pronounced feedback and weight distribution.</li><li>The shoulder buttons are mounted differently on the board so they don’t break as easily in a fall.</li><li>The triggers are wider and made of smoky semi-transparent plastic that looks cool.</li><li>The rear intake vents are slightly larger.</li><li>The joystick tops are now attached with screws, so you could theoretically 3D print your own tops or stem extenders.</li><li>Similarly, the new back buttons are screwed into the rear shell now, so you could theoretically move their position in your own 3D printed rear shell.</li><li>There’s a ring around the fingerprint power button now to find it easier by feel.</li><li>The Turbo mode still operates at 25W, but Silent has been bumped from 10W to 13W, and Performance from 15W to 17W. </li><li>The battery is now rated to have 80 percent remaining capacity after 3 years of cycling, up from 70 percent</li><li>The handheld uses a different IMU now.</li><li>It still has magnetic Hall Effect triggers, but revised slightly to make sure they don’t interfere with the speakers or vibration motors.</li><li>While it does support 100W charging now, it still comes with the same 65W adapter.</li><li>It’s not compatible with existing cases and mounts, but Asus is in touch with fan favorites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23769329/jsaux-valve-steam-deck-pc-gaming-accessories-china-interview-hands-on-testing">JSAUX</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163651/steam-deck-magsafe-gopro-fingers-brilliance">Deckmate</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23924719/dbrand-killswitch-asus-rog-ally-steam-deck-update">Dbrand</a> to offer new ones.</li><li>Existing Ally owners will be able to migrate settings to an Ally X with a cloud backup.</li></ul></div><div><p>Last but not least, there’s an easter egg in the comfy new grips — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture">just like the PS5’s controller is studded with incredibly tiny PlayStation symbols</a>, the ROG Ally X’s grips are covered with “ROG ROG ROG”:</p></div><p>I can’t wait for a review unit of this handheld, because battery is king in handheld gaming PC world, and the Ally X is about to be king of handheld battery packs. Just don’t necessarily expect it to dethrone the Steam Deck OLED, because there’s only so far Asus can go without a more efficient chip and screen — and because I’m still not sure how I feel about Asus’ <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/asus-tone-deaf-response-to-ongoing-rma-support-issues-isnt-going-to-encourage-me-to-keep-recommending-asus-tech/">deteriorating reputation</a> for support.</p><p>Some small news today there too, though: <a href="https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROGNA/status/1797131331446669510">Asus has just announced</a> that all ROG Ally devices in North America now have a two-year warranty.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on IGN</a>, Take-Two is planning to sell or shut down its indie publishing label, Private Division. The NYC-based publisher was founded in December 2017 to help bring games from smaller developers to market.</p>
<p>It published games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ancestors-humankind-odyssey-humans-were-a-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disintegration-explosive-cracked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disintegration</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rollerdrome-the-grind-is-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rollerdrome</a>. However, in April, most employees were told they would be laid off as Take-Two is pulling the rug under Private Division. Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games and OlliOlli World developer Roll7 are also on the verge of being shut down.</p>
<p>For now, a skeleton crew remains in place to honor the deals with Moon Studios (for No Rest for the Wicked, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> just about three months ago on Steam Early Access), Wētā Workshop (for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-is-a-cozy-hobbit-life-sim-out-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales of the Shire</a>, due later this year), and Pokémon developer Game Freak, which is currently working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-freak-pokemon-is-working-on-a-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new action/adventure IP</a> codenamed Project Bloom. Meanwhile, earlier this week, Private Division backed down from the partnership <a href="https://wccftech.com/private-division-and-bloober-team-partner-up-for-new-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late 2022 with Bloober Team.</p>
<p>The Polish developer noted <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/espi/pl/reports/view/2,561716#pvy7zfso61" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an official report</a>:</p>
<p><em>Observing the situation on the global gaming market, Bloober Team has taken such a scenario into account and is prepared for potential alternative solutions. As of the date of publication of the current report, the Company continues work on Project C in accordance with the planned production and marketing schedule in the self-publishing model. At the same time, Bloober Team does not rule out the possibility of continuing this production based on cooperation with a new publisher. The current situation of the Company allows maintaining the assumptions of the Strategic Plan adopted by the Company for 2023-2027. This situation may constitute a significant opportunity to increase the potential revenues related to this title.</em></p>
<p>Private Division clearly isn't profitable any longer for Take-Two, which is reportedly trying to sell the Kerbal Space Program IP, possibly in a bundle with developer Intercept Games. Moreover, the entire label might be sold to a private equity firm, though the report says a deal hasn't been reached yet.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is coming to Netflix on October 10, as confirmed recently by a new trailer showcasing the all-animated series. It was back in 2021 that the series was announced, and we finally have the lowdown on who will be voicing Lara Croft in this production.</p>



<p>It’s Hayley Atwell, known best for her work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Peggy Carter. In comments online, fans of the Tomb Raider franchise have praised Netflix for their casting choice, sounding off with the firm consensus that Atwell offers the perfect vocal representation of the iconic heroine.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-lara-croft">The Legend of Lara Croft</h2>



<p>On October 10, 2024, a new Lara Croft will surface on Netflix in an exclusive animated series, voiced by Hayley Atwell. Most recently, Lara Croft has been played (consistently) by Camilla Luddington, who has upheld the identity of the game-based character since 2013’s reboot, known as Tomb Raider. She would reprise the role in Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>On the big screen, many will claim that Angelina Jolie’s portrayal of the video game legend will go unbeaten until the end of time, but Alicia Vikander did a fine job in 2018’s Tomb Raider.</p>



<p>Now, the mantle passes to Hayley Atwell, who voices Lara Croft through eight episodes of the first season of The Legend of Lara Croft. Admittedly, it’s yet another ‘reboot’ or reinterpretation of Lara Croft in another universe, but it’s one that fans are very excited about.</p>

<p>Gamers don’t die, they respawn – right? </p>



<p>Recently, a debate was struck up online when some Steam users took an interest in what happens to their library of games when they pass away. It was a topic that was picked up with Valve, who subsequently confirmed that <strong>nothing happens</strong> – they can’t pass the ownership of your account to someone else or ‘merge it’ with someone else’s library if you die, and it can’t be transferred via a will.</p>



<p>Now, gamers are getting increasingly concerned about what happens to their game libraries when they die.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-be-prepared">Be Prepared</h2>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://respawnfirst.com/what-happens-to-your-gog-account-if-you-die-gog-confirms-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by RespawnFirst</a>, the team at GOG – a competing storefront to Steam – was probed about this topic, with the RF squad asking what would happen to their library if they were to suffer from an untimely passing.</p>



<p>GOG was a little more forthcoming and lenient than the stricter employees at Valve:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable. However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account… we’ll do our best to make it happen. We’re willing to handle such situations and preserve your GOG library, but currently need the help of the justice system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>RF also discovered that Epic Games won’t transfer your account to another user in the case of your death, either. But what about other platforms and providers? In 2022, 89.5% of all games sold in the United Kingdom were digital, so there are vast libraries out there stacked to the brim with titles that true gamers wouldn’t want to go to waste.</p>



<p>For the most part, it seems as though when a gamer dies, they take their libraries with them. Of course, if you’re able to get into their account and change the details, you’re more than welcome to what’s there, but it’s a shady way to secure someone’s gaming collection posthumously. In almost every scenario, the platform provider <strong>won’t </strong>transfer an account to another user or merge gaming libraries – which could ultimately mean that hundreds of games and thousands of dollars go to waste.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s terms suggest that when someone dies, their account and library are left to fade into the abyss. It’s a similar situation for Xbox users, but there are some suggestions online that talk about Nintendo being open to allowing an executor of an estate access to digital profiles. </p>



<p>The long and short of it is that users should find some way to make their account details known before they pass – if that’s at all possible. If not, there doesn’t seem to be any legal basis that requires providers to open up their accounts to next of kin or any family members or close friends. In this increasingly technical world, it’s not <strong>that </strong>uncommon to see people leaving their digital treasures to those they bid farewell to when they leave this mortal plane.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23940888/godzilla-minus-one-review-digital-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="oZ88Ao"><small>This review of </small><small><em>Godzilla Minus One </em></small><small>was originally posted in conjunction with the movie’s theatrical release. It has been updated and reposted now that the film is available on digital platforms.</small></p>
<p id="EtSW6T"><em>Godzilla Minus One</em> is the throwback movie that longtime Godzilla fans have been waiting for. This is an age of abundance for Godzilla media: Over the past seven years, as part of a partnership between Toho and Hollywood studios, the giant lizard received three animated films on Netflix, two U.S. movies, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906907/godzilla-apple-tv-show-monarch-monsters-review">an Apple TV series that premieres Nov. 17</a>. Godzilla fans like me haven’t been left wanting. And yet something crucial has been missing from most of this media, something fundamental to the earliest films in the Godzilla franchise: terror. </p>
<p id="O2W3x0">We nearly had a decade of terrifying Godzilla. In 2016, Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi released<em> </em>the horrifying <em>Shin Godzilla</em>, widely regarded as one of the best entries in the franchise. It promised a return to the petrifying, humanity-destroying Godzilla of the past. But <em>Shin Godzilla</em> marked a lengthy hiatus in the production of Japanese live-action Godzilla films, and signaled the beginning of a colossally successful American era for the big lizard. The American Godzilla media of the past seven years, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/7/18648048/godzilla-king-of-monsters-post-credits-ending-kong-woolly-mammoth-interview"><em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22356658/godzilla-vs-kong-review"><em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em></a>, and those Netflix anime movies, ranges from serviceable to pretty damn good, though its creators borrowed far more from the Marvel Cinematic Universe than from classic kaiju matinees. </p>

<p id="YtT0PU">After years of letting Hollywood take its contractually mandated turn, Toho returns with a literal throwback movie that lands Godzilla nearly a century in the past. He doesn’t have any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_Godzilla">adorable friends</a> in this new Japanese-produced live-action period piece. You won’t see him save Tokyo from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedorah">kaiju that represents oceanic pollution</a>, or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoC3IuB_Au0">reptilian mech that embodies capitalism</a> gone awry. Nor will you <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22356658/godzilla-vs-kong-review">spot King Kong</a> or hear mention of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906907/godzilla-apple-tv-show-monarch-monsters-review">the Monsterverse</a>.</p>
<p id="ItgbCu">Instead, <em>Godzilla Minus One </em>sticks to the original recipe. The movie that kicked it all off, 1954’s <em>Godzilla, </em>mixes horror, classic melodrama, and a feverish anti-war message to mine the anxieties of ’50s Japan. <em>Minus One</em> goes even further into the past, with a story set in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Writer-director Takashi Yamazaki (who took another beloved franchise back to basics with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/11/3/21546514/lupin-iii-the-first-movie-review-hayao-miyazaki-castle-of-cagliostro"><em>Lupin III: The First</em></a>)<em> </em>imagines how a Japan with no military, no economy, and no international support would respond to Godzilla’s first attack. </p>
<p id="BBcWvR">So is this a reboot? A remake? A reimagining? A bit of all of the above.</p>

<p id="1CXuWC">Our reluctant hero is Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who, in the waning hours of the war, faked a plane malfunction to escape death. In a Godzilla film, the giant monsters typically carry the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/05/godzilla-meaning-monster-metaphors.html">central political metaphor</a>, but in <em>Minus One</em>, Koichi shoulders that burden on his tiny human frame. As a kamikaze pilot who survived the war, he returns to his neighborhood to find that little remains beyond rubble and a few surviving neighbors.</p>
<p id="seIKOq">This is ground-level Godzilla storytelling: We see the events through the eyes of Koichi, his neighbors, and his co-workers, rather than through knowledgeable government leaders, superhuman soldiers, or Godzilla himself. As with any great kaiju film, we spend much of the film’s first half learning to care about these lovable folks just before their world gets obliterated by hundreds of tons of giant lizard.</p>
<p id="mkRhKp">Koichi is an unusually grim lead, even by the standards of the more somber early Godzilla films. He despises himself for his decision to bail on his kamikaze mission, and his neighbors, who’ve lost their homes and families, aren’t especially thrilled to see him either. Nonetheless, together they rebuild from bombed-out blocks to bivouacked shacks, and eventually to modest homes that cluster among the suburban Tokyo sprawl. Considering this a Godzilla movie, it’s like watching people rebuilding their lives with a giant box of dominoes.</p>

<p id="53AR5H"><em>Minus One</em> isn’t a period piece in aesthetic alone: The story itself feels like something preserved from the 1950s. Yamazaki steeps it in the melodrama of a classic historical epic. His characters are capital-R Romantic, constantly making bold proclamations and grand sacrifices, discussing heavy topics where modern characters would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P05deS1h6oM">quip about shawarma</a>. </p>
<p id="UKCBWc">Koichi and his companions debate the power of nonviolence, the value of self-preservation, and the unjust expectations governments put upon their populations in times of war. The latter point makes <em>Godzilla Minus One </em>a surprisingly potent pairing with Hayao Miyazaki’s animated semi-biopic<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275291/the-wind-rises-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-hbo-max"><em>The Wind Rises</em></a>, and a timely response to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/02/national/japan-sdf-recruitment-problems/">Japan’s current military buildup</a>.</p>
<p id="Jkm7x0">Of course, it’s precisely when Koichi and company begin to open their hearts and get their feet on the ground that Godzilla arrives. (Technically, he appears earlier in the film, but I’ll spare you the spoilers.) When Godzilla makes his first legitimate impression, he strikes like a 2023 version of the original Godzilla: the living manifestation of nuclear terror. His initial physical destruction is dwarfed by his heat ray, which, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23855460/godzilla-minus-one-trailer-release-date">as shown in the trailer</a>, leaves behind little more than a crater and a mushroom cloud.</p>

<p id="GfwhSr">This is the moment in modern Godzilla movies where the heroes send in mechs, a rival kaiju, or some cutting-edge military aircraft. But <em>Minus One</em>, to its credit, sticks to the original formula, using historical reality to wave away any easy solutions. Most of Japan’s military has been decommissioned following its surrender to the U.S., its remaining warships sent away for disassembly. The U.S. government won’t help, either; its government is afraid to move weaponry into the region, which might provoke an anxious Soviet Union. So there’s only one group left to stop Godzilla: the civilian population. It’s a legitimately terrifying prospect — a group of average people versus a kaiju.</p>
<p id="2I9j0Z">For those of us under the age of 70, conceptualizing Godzilla as a genuinely frightening horror monster can be a challenge. Hell, he appears in an upcoming <a href="https://amazon.com/Love-Godzilla-Olivia-Luchini/dp/0593661443?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://amazon.com/Love-Godzilla-Olivia-Luchini/dp/0593661443?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23704929__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23704929__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">children’s book that espouses the power of love</a>. But in 1954, Godzilla terrified audiences across the globe, as a metaphor for nuclear weapons’ imprecise, passionless ability to level whole cities.</p>
<p id="yKfXfa">In its back half, <em>Minus One</em> recreates that style of terror with human stakes and an intensely political message. Yamazaki brings together the threads he carefully put in place: Koichi’s mental health, the barely rebuilt Japan, the absent government, the abandoned military, and, in true classic melodrama fashion, a love story. Then he pits them against an indifferent, catastrophic force.</p>

<p id="aHRpiL">Is Godzilla the threat of nuclear weaponry? The temptation to respond to violence with greater violence? An indifferent American military in a period of national rebuild? The fact that<em> Godzilla Minus One</em> prompts these questions underscores what modern Godzilla media has been missing.</p>
<p id="beu9UY">Don’t get me wrong; I’ve enjoyed the near-decade of Godzilla entertainment in America. But as someone who has <em>Shin Godzilla </em>at the top of<em> </em>his Godzilla tier list, who introduced his child to Mothra at far too young an age, and has a Hedorah anatomy poster sitting behind him at this very moment, this is the Godzilla I’ve been waiting for. </p>
<p id="Z8VTz4">Godzilla films provide filmmakers a precious opportunity to tell political stories not just about individuals, but about communities, or even entire nations. And because Godzilla movies will always feature a kaiju destroying famous cities and landmarks like a toddler let loose in a Lego museum, people will show up. It’s a fantastic entertainment vessel for big ideas. For years now, Godzilla has been giving us plenty of sugar. But considering the state of the world, I’m glad he’s once again showing up with a bit of medicine, too. </p>

            <p>I haven't played Bloodborne and so references to its world or characters mean little to me. Kart racers, meanwhile? There I'm in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It's those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

<p>Here's the launch trailer:

<p>The free game includes 21 racers, 13 karts, 15 tracks and split screen multiplayer. More unusually, it also has a full campaign mode "with boss fights".
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, you can <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/nmkart">download Nightmare Kart from Itch.io</a> by naming your own price. It'll also be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930160/Nightmare_Kart/">via Steam</a> "once the game is out of build review jail."
</p>
<p>Nightmare Kart is from the makers of Bloodborne PSX, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-psx-is-a-smart-demake-of-a-fromsoft-classic">similarly styled demake</a> that maintains the third-person action of its inspiration. Its kart racing spin-off began life as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvDQGmCeiTk&amp;ab_channel=LilithWalther">an April Fool's joke during development</a>. Sort of. 'Bloodborne Kart' is also a long-running joke within the Bloodborne community more generally.
</p>
<p>The change to "Nightmare Kart", and the removal of other more direct references to the FromSoft game, was the result of the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-kart-will-scrub-the-branding-off-after-being-contacted-by-sonys-lawyers">being contacted by Sony's lawyers</a>. Will I miss those references? As mentioned above, I wouldn't recognise them whether they were there or not, but I'm glad I still get the opportunity to speed around some gothic horror race tracks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wildermyths-developers-are-going-into-hibernation-with-no-sequel-or-new-project-planned<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>The may return from the wilderness one day, they say</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Turn-based tactical RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wildermyth">Wildermyth</a> is one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wildermyth-review">best games Sin has ever played</a>. It got a second DLC, Omenroad, which turned it into a roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/excellent-fantasy-rpg-wildermyth-is-turning-into-a-roguelike-via-dlc">earlier this month</a>.
</p>
<p>Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Active development on Wildermyth is complete. We will continue to support the game and fix critical bugs, but don't expect new content, going forward. We will be saying farewell to many of our team members. Worldwalker Games is going into hibernation for now," wrote studio co-owner Nate Austin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/763890/view/4151834437164418980">in an announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>The announcement isn't the result of Omenroad's sales performance, which is apparently "doing quite well". Instead, Austin says that they're "going into hibernation because we are done with this project."
</p>
<p>It sounds as if, while there's no timeline, this may not be the end of Worldwalker Games forever. "I'm pretty sure we'll eventually find something else to pour our passion into, and we'll let you know about it when the time comes."
</p>
<p>Austin elaborated on that thought, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wildermyth-developer-worldwalker-games-is-going-into-hibernation-not-because-it-has-to-but-because-it-wants-to-we-did-what-we-set-out-to-do/">telling PC Gamer</a> that "the only way we know how to [find a new project] is by going off into the metaphorical wilderness for a while." Austin also says that they're "not excited to make a Wildermyth sequel" after 11 years of working on the original.
</p>
<p>We spoke to the team at Worldwalker in 2022 to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-wildermyth-how-two-ex-riot-devs-and-a-college-grad-built-the-most-innovative-rpg-in-years">learn more about that eleven-year development process</a>.</p>

        <p>Flexible action-RPG launched in 2020</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It feels as if every action-RPG can be described in terms of its relationship to genre daddy Diablo. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolcen-lords-of-mayhem">Wolcen:Lords Of Mayhem</a>, for example, launched a few months after Diablo 4 was announced and helped to satiate some early click cravings. Briefly.
</p>
<p>Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they're ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Thank you for your unwavering support and dedication. We are fully aware of the challenges that have emerged from the early technical decisions made regarding the game's architecture, challenges that are insurmountable without a complete technology overhaul," says the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/424370/view/4187863234164885744">announcement regarding the future of the game</a>.
</p>
<p>"We have diligently updated Wolcen, enhancing every facet of the game from introducing new chapters and items to improving UI, animations, and the meticulous balancing of skills, items, and gameplay, alongside technical enhancements. Despite these efforts and the team's dedication behind our patches, we've encountered foundational hurdles that prevent further improvements under the existing framework.
</p>
<p>"It is with a heavy heart that we announce a significant change: Starting September 3, 2024, Wolcen will no longer support multiplayer functionality. Additionally, we will cease further development and support for the game."
</p>
<p>Wolcen Studio say ending development will allow them to "focus on new projects", where they can apply the lessons they learned from working on Wolcen. Wolcen: Lords Of Mayhem will remain playable in singleplayer and its price will be permanently reduced to reflect the loss of functionality.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hellboy-video-games-ranked-the-good-the-bad-and-the-wyrd/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hellboy-video-games-ranked-the-good-the-bad-and-the-wyrd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In 2024, one of the most popular and recognizable non-Marvel or DC Comics creations turned 30: Hellboy. Yes, the Dark Horse Comics staple has been around for three decades now, having appeared in some truly remarkable print stories along the way. Of course, given his icon status, it’s no surprise that Anung Un Rama has transcended the comic book medium on numerous occasions.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Since his first wide-release story, 1994’s <em>Seed of Destruction</em>, Hellboy has tried out numerous mediums. He’s a merchandise mover with plenty of t-shirts, action figures, and posters to show for it. He has popped up at the movies three times, with Ron Perlman and David Harbour taking him on. Hellboy has even made the jump to animation. Not to mention, he has also cracked paranormal cases in the video game realm.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">To say Hellboy’s gaming tenure has been a mixed bag would be an understatement. While his guest appearances in <em>Injustice 2</em> and <em>Brawlhalla</em> were fun, his dedicated titles have proven less so. Here they all are, ranked from worst to relative best.</p>  <figure data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via AppSpy</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-tooth-fairy-terror" data-injectable="false">5. Hellboy II: The Golden Army – Tooth Fairy Terror</h2> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Following the success of <em>Hellboy</em> in 2004, director Guillermo del Toro released <em>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</em> in 2008. Ultimately, it failed to reach the heights of its predecessor, but the cast, production design, and story are all pretty strong. However, the same cannot be said for its shoddy mobile game tie-in, Tuesday Creatives’ <em>Hellboy II: The Golden Army – Tooth Fairy Terror</em>.</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">Released in December 2008, <em>Tooth Fairy Terror</em> was available on the Apple App Store for free, and it’s not hard to figure out why. As the terrifying tooth fairies from the film fly toward you, you have to tap on them to “shoot” them. To reload, shake your screen, then get back to defending yourself. Survive as long as you can and rack up as high of a score as possible. </p>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">There’s not much more to it than that. <em>Tooth Fairy Terror </em>is basic, boring, and entirely skippable for even the most dedicated Hellboy fans.</p>  <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-hellboy-dogs-of-the-night-hellboy-asylum-seeker" data-injectable="false">4. Hellboy: Dogs of the Night/Hellboy: Asylum Seeker</h2> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true"><em>Hellboy: Dogs of the Night</em> was originally developed for PC back in 2000, later moving to the PlayStation in 2003 under the new title <em>Hellboy: Asylum Seeker</em>. The fact that this is the very first Hellboy-centric video game ever, and that it seems some amount of effort was made to translate the source material into a video game, is about all that this dual-titled Cryo Studios effort has going for it. </p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><em>Asylum Seeker</em>/<em>Dogs of the Night</em> has players control Hellboy (David Gasman) himself as he investigates the disappearance of one of his fellow Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense agents. He uses his fists (typically just his regular one, not the massive stone one) and his revolver to fend off enemies, slowly wandering around various environments to piece together what happened to his friend.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">All in all, this game is slow, the combat of the tank-control-bound Hellboy feels hollow at best, and the graphics are hideous, even for the era. There’s some amount of reverence for the <em>Hellboy</em> comics here in the design and story, but the execution is a big swing and a miss.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via IGN</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-hellboy-the-stench-of-evil" data-injectable="false">3. Hellboy: The Stench of Evil</h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Going back to the realm of mobile games, we come to another game meant to drum up hype for <em>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</em>, as well as tie into another soon-to-be-mentioned Hellboy game. This time around, it’s G5 Entertainment’s <em>Hellboy: The Stench of Evil</em>, which was released on July 10, 2008 and brings the title character into the exciting world of action platforming. The problem is, this game isn’t very exciting.</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><em>The Stench of Evil</em> is a pretty bare-bones platformer. Hellboy runs and jumps through a few different environments, plowing through enemies with ease. If you take enough punishment to fill up the rage meter, your attacks do even more damage. For a mobile game, the visuals are decent, with fairly detailed environments and plenty of color.</p> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">On the whole,<em> Hellboy: The Stench of Evil </em>isn’t horrifically bad, nor is it particularly good. It’s a middle-of-the-road promotional game and nothing more.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via IGN</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-hellboy-the-science-of-evil" data-injectable="false">2. Hellboy: The Science of Evil</h2> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">After spending some time away from the console scene, Hellboy and his companions made their grand return in 2008. <em>Hellboy: The Science of Evil</em> brings the del Toro <em>Hellboy</em> universe to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PSP, complete with Perlman back as Big Red, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien — all three being playable, no less. They unite to defeat the evil Herman von Klempt (Jürgen Prochnow) and his forces.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Compared to the previous three games, <em>The Science of Evil</em> is a huge step forward, but it’s still not great. The design, voice acting, combat, and story can’t quite make up for the somewhat lacking graphics and uninspired gameplay. With a bit more polish and development, <em>The Science of Evil </em>could’ve been the Hellboy adventure gamers had wanted for years.</p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">It has also been said that Lobster Johnson, voiced by the legendary Bruce Campbell, was slated for a DLC release, only for such content to be canned. This is just another example of <em>The Science of Evil</em> coming so close to greatness just to end up missing the mark.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-hellboy-web-of-wyrd" data-injectable="false">1. Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</h2> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">Well over a decade after receiving his own dedicated game, Hellboy returned to the gaming forefront in 2023 via <em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>. It’s not using a movie franchise as its basis, nor is it designed to promote something else. It’s just a Hellboy tale, in the aesthetic of the <em>Hellboy</em> comics, with Dark Horse and Mignola directly involved. But, how well does it all come together?</p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><em>Web of Wyrd</em> is undeniably the most beautiful Hellboy-centric game to date, appearing as a comic come to life. The late, great Lance Reddick makes for an excellent Hellboy, who’s looking for a missing BPRD agent through a dimension called the Wyrd. Unfortunately, the combat in this <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-difference-between-roguelike-and-roguelite-games/">roguelike (not to be confused with roguelite)</a> title leaves much to be desired, resulting in much of the gameplay feeling dull and repetitive.</p>
 <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">With 30 years behind him, evidently, Hellboy has yet to receive a truly definitive video game adaptation. Hopefully, at some point in the next 30, that game will come along.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-is-asobi%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98biggest-game-ever%E2%80%99-with-150-playstation-cameos.887355/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Team Asobi has clarified that Astro Bot is the company’s biggest game ever, boasting an ambitious scope that incorporates cameos from around 150 iconic PlayStation characters. Releasing in time to celebrate PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, Astro Bot is a full-fledged platformer that’s drenched in Sony-themed goodness, featuring 80 levels that give players ‘a renewed experience every 10 minutes or so.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-blasting-off">Astro Bot Blasting Off</h2>



<p>On September 6, Astro Bot will be released exclusively on PlayStation 5. It’s one of the most highly anticipated games that was shown at the recent State of Play event, which elsewhere was fairly lacklustre and didn’t hit too much of a mark with the community. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://ew.com/astro-bot-2024-game-playstation-cameos-exclusive-8655347">a recent interview</a>, Team Asobi’s Nicolas Doucet spoke at length about Astro Bot, revealing how in-depth and expansive a game it’ll be:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to make a big game. This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro’s big story. We call it&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>&nbsp;because we treat this as a new beginning. That’s a really, really big game. I think for us, that’s the biggest game we’ve ever made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the first Astro title was a free bolt-on that came with the PlayStation 5 console, Astro Bot is a premium release with plenty of content to explore. In some ways, Astro Bot has been touted as a ‘reunion’ for some of PlayStation’s most iconic characters. With a roster of 150 cameos being lined up, it seems impossible that any PS-based personality from the last thirty years will have been missed. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-gone-director-sony-execs-%E2%80%98were-never-fans%E2%80%99-hence-no-sequel.887352/</guid>

<p>Ahead of the recent State of Play showcase that revealed upcoming games for the PlayStation ecosystem, Jeff Ross, who worked as the game director on Days Gone, made a damning statement. On the subject of Days Gone 2 making an appearance at a PlayStation showcase, Ross explained that Sony executives, like the newly crowned CEO Hermen Hulst, ‘were never fans’, insinuating that’s a core reason why a follow-up title was never developed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-days-gone-by">Days Gone By</h2>



<p>Days Gone was a solid enough post-apocalyptic title with plenty of meat on the bones, but thanks to a launch that was plagued with issues, it drew negative feedback very early on, marring the game considerably. From the veteran team at Bend Studio, Days Gone emerged as something quite new and tasty in the zombie-slasher world, presenting players with motorbiking badass, Deacon St John, in a world torn apart and ripe for the plucking.</p>



<p>In a post published on social media before the recent State of Play showcase, Jeff Ross, one of the senior team members who worked on Days Gone, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen. Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were hopeful in the comments but Jeff Ross shut down one particular poster by writing, ‘This is a case of cancelled for now versus cancelled forever.’ It’s sad news for those who enjoyed Days Gone – like myself – but it was a one-shot wonder that won’t ever see the light of day again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="457" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the third and final season of <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em> and the miniseries <em>Tales of the Empire</em> now firmly in the rearview mirror, the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise is revving up for yet another new addition. The first live-action series in some time, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-release-date-poster-cast-and-more/">Star Wars: The Acolyte</a> </em>aims to take viewers back in time. Long before the Empire, long before the Clone Wars, there was the Jedi Order, the Republic, and a mysterious, powerful force seeking to destroy them both.</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false"><em>The Acolyte</em> takes audiences a century ahead of <em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em> as a group of Jedi attempt to sort out a criminal conspiracy. Jedi are being killed left and right and no one knows who is responsible. This intriguing tale comes from series creator and showrunner Leslye Headland, who’s no stranger to the Star Wars galaxy.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">In fact, Headland herself shared that her love of <em>Star Wars</em> helped her create <em>The Acolyte</em>. More specifically, her love and knowledge of <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs and the Expanded Universe influenced her creative direction. “I was coming at it as a fan who was much more into the RPG that the Extended Universe feeds on,” Headland said in an interview with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com./hollywood/2022/05/the-acolyte-star-wars-series">Vanity Fair</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">Continuing, Headland mentioned that <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs went a long way in helping her creativity come out as a kid. She didn’t feel the need to adhere strictly to what the films had to offer narratively, instead making her own fun in George Lucas’ massive sandbox. She brought that mentality to <em>The Acolyte</em>, affording her the chance to push the boundaries of <em>Star Wars</em> itself.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">“I was able to escape into that world with my friends, to pretend that I was part of that world. It was not like, ‘And now you have to do a scene from the original movie,’” she added, noting that, in her mind, there’s far more to <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling than strictly rehashing the core story elements, character arcs, and the like of the now-nine movie-long Skywalker saga.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Though Headland didn’t name any specific <em>Star Wars</em> games in her Vanity Fair interview, she did indirectly mention one game that helped lay the foundation of her <em>Acolyte</em> vision elsewhere. She told <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-wars-the-acolyte-shows-us-a-side-of-the-sith-weve-never-seen-before/">Den of Geek</a>, “Darth Traya really stuck out to me as an inspiration.” Traya (Sara Kestelman), formerly the Jedi Kreia, is a major player in the 2004 hit RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/better-with-age-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, fans don’t have to wait too long to see where specifically Headland’s enduring love for <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs manifests in her show. <em>The Acolyte</em> premieres on June 4 exclusively on Disney+.</p>

<p data-characters="224" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since 2005, when<em> Doctor Who</em> was revived after 16 years off screen, there have been six faces who have picked up the mantle to play the Doctor, in an official sense. However, they’re not the only Doctors we’ve seen.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">There are a whole string of Doctors and Doctor-adjacent characters, such as Jackson Lake, who briefly believed himself to be an incarnation of the Doctor after having his memories altered by a Cyberman, who appear throughout the series. While I haven’t mentioned all of them here, I’ve taken what I consider to be the man faces and ranked them.</p> <h2 id="h-10-the-14th-doctor-ncuti-gatwa" data-injectable="false"><strong>10 The 14th Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">I know that he’s only been the Doctor for four episodes, and I truly wish I could place Ncuti Gatwa higher up on this list because, as an actor, he has some serious talent. However, the storyline is severely lacking and there are so many questions left unanswered that I can’t even fathom him being anywhere other than here on this list.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">That said, the one episode of season 14 that I would consider a ‘proper <em>Doctor Who</em>’ episode, The Devil’s Chord, does display that he can play the role well and perhaps in future I’ll have reason to switch this list around a little.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-master-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>9 Master Doctor&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Imagine waiting countless years to become the Doctor, finally achieving it via forced regeneration and then screwing it up by being, for lack of a better word, an idiot. Not that anyone expected any differently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">There’s something truly incredible about witnessing the Master in the now familiar clothing of Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor, complete with delicate ear chain, while he prances around feeling proud of himself. Then, wearing what can only be described as his attempts to don clothing from every era, he gets marooned on a planet which only exists where it does because he has ambitions that are far too big.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">We love to hate him, but the Master Doctor was a truly bizarre moment in time that deserves a mention.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-8-war-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>8 War Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">The ninth known iteration of the Doctor, and the only one ever to have put down the Sonic and picked up a gun. After using the Moment to try and bring about the end of the war between the Daleks and the Timelords, the War Doctor is offered a glimpse of his future and sets to work with his future incarnations to end the genocide of both races.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">Sadly, thanks to some timey-wimey nonsense, the Doctor doesn’t remember his time as the War Doctor, and is led to believe that they destroyed Gallifrey instead of saving it. It’s a hard to watch moment in <em>Doctor Who</em> history, but the War Doctor deserves a place here as much as any other.</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-the-9th-doctor-christopher-eccleston" data-injectable="false"><strong>7 The 9th Doctor (Christopher Eccleston)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The first face of the Doctor when the show’s revival happened in 2005, Christopher Eccleston brought in an impressive 10.81 million viewers during this first episode. He was only the Doctor for one season, which I would say is a shame but it did bring David Tennant into the starring role.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">However, Eccleston’s episodes do cement his place as a part of history and I will never stop loving the entire Bad Wolf storyline. What really shines from his era, though, is Rose, who went on to star alongside David Tennant and is still a beloved companion.</p> <h2 id="h-6-the-13th-doctor-jodie-whittaker" data-injectable="false"><strong>6 The 13th Doctor (Jodie Whittaker)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor is close to my heart, mostly for the fact that she proved women could play the part too, but also because of some specific episodes. The six episodes which make up the Flux story are all-time favorites for me, not to mention her jaunt into the Pendle Witch Trials and, although he didn’t show up for very long, John Bishop made one hell of a companion in the shape of Dan.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-5-fugitive-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>5 Fugitive Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Although not considered an official Doctor, we discovered during Jodie Whittaker’s time that the Fugitive Doctor is indeed one of the Doctor’s iterations that had been forgotten due to memories being erased and kept by Division.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Every time the Fugitive Doctor appears on screen, you just know that things are about to get both badass, and a little confusing. Although she’s halfway down this list, she remains one of my favorite Doctors purely because of her no-punches attitude and lack of time for tomfoolery.</p> <h2 id="h-4-the-12th-doctor-peter-capaldi" data-injectable="false"><strong>4 The 12th Doctor (Peter Capaldi)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">With Stephen Moffat as showrunner, Peter Capaldi’s Doctor had some truly amazing storylines. From his one-man battle inside the time prison, to the introduction of everybody’s favorite Sontaran Strax and the reptilian detective Vastra. All of this isn’t even touching on the heartbreak of Clara’s story, ending with her taking a TARDIS back to Galiffrey to fix her own timeline after the Doctor loses all memories of her as his companion.</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-doctor-donna" data-injectable="false"><strong>3 Doctor Donna</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">Part Timelord, Part Human. While she may not be an ‘official’ iteration of the Doctor, I can’t write this list without including Doctor Donna. She absorbed the knowledge of the Timelords in order to save the Doctor, turned into an all round badass and as a viewer, isn’t that the dream? To know everything the Doctor does and be able to use it for good?&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-2-the-11th-doctor-matt-smith" data-injectable="false"><strong>2 The 11th Doctor (Matt Smith)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">Matt Smith’s Doctor is the reason we have the rather disgusting pairing of Fish Fingers and Custard, and his adventures brought in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(2005%E2%80%93present)#Series_6_(2011)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7.5 million viewers per week</a> on average. The 11th Doctor had arguably the best companion story, with Amy and Rory Pond along on his adventures. The whole plot of Amy being the mother of River Song is a head-twisting, timey-wimey joy ride.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-the-10th-and-14th-doctor-david-tennant" data-injectable="false"><strong>1 The 10th and 14th Doctor (David Tennant)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">The 10th Doctor, who was so good and so beloved that they brought him back to be the 14th as well. David Tennant’s Doctor lives on in other timelines not once, but twice – once with Rose and once with Donna and her family after the first ever bi-regeneration.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">When David Tennant was the face of the Doctor, viewing figures hit an all time high of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_Damned_(Doctor_Who)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13.31 million viewers</a> and the promise of Tennant’s return in The Power of the Doctor and the three 60th anniversary special episodes in 2023 dragged old fans back in, boosting view counts by over four million over the previous episode. That speaks for itself, really.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24169416/tianas-bayou-adventure-pov-video-4k-ride-through<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="iAXjJm">Tiana’s Bayou Adventure has finally replaced Splash Mountain at Disney World. The Disney Parks YouTube account is celebrating the completion of this unprecedented transformation with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLmhNWq5kT0">nearly 10-minute, 4K ride-through</a>. </p>
<p id="IhPtES">Our first impression? Holy moly, they <em>actually</em> pulled this off!</p>
<p id="YfdzXf">The ride’s designers had to walk a tightrope while reimagining — in terms of scale and popularity — one of the biggest rides at Disney’s theme parks. They would need to maintain (or improve upon) Splash Mountain’s abundance of animatronic characters, representing the classic approach to Disney’s most iconic rides. But they’d also have to incorporate modern technology (ultra high-resolution screens, custom 3D animation) for Bayou Adventure to fit alongside the parks’ other new “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_ticket">E-ticket attractions</a>,” like Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey’s Runaway Railroad.</p>
<p id="VWzHTa">In a decision that will please the most nostalgic among us, the design team favored the old-school approach, stuffing the ride with an astonishing number of animatronic characters. They used screens to supplement the experience, like the powdered sugar on a delicious beignet. </p>

<p id="vO0HpG">As with Splash Mountain, the ride has a relaxed start. On a log flume, the guests take a leisurely tour of Tiana’s garden and the nearby bayou, before collecting animal instrumentalists to play a tune at the Disney Princess’s restaurant.  First, the riders meet a zydeco band featuring possums, beavers, bears, and wolves. Then, the voodoo priestess Mama Odie shrinks the riders to the size of a frog so they can tour a mini-version of the bayou and befriend some musically gifted bugs and amphibian friends.</p>
<p id="yEAWWV">The ride culminates, as promised by its premise, with a performance by Tiana at her restaurant, accompanied by her animal orchestra. By our count, this humongous space features no fewer than 15 animatronics, a recreation of Tiana’s restaurant, and a wealth of high-res screens featuring additional characters from the film, reimagined from 2D into 3D.</p>

<p id="Qyn3jx">Splash Mountain, based on the 1946 film <em>Song of the South</em>, opened in 1992, despite Disney having never released the film in the United States on home video due to its racist portrayal of life on a plantation in the Southern United States. In 2023, Scout Tafoya wrote about Disney’s long history of attempting to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/century-of-disney/23649353/song-south-disney-splash-mountain-racist-controversy">alter or erase the history of <em>Song of the South</em></a>,  treating the film like a cultural artifact that has become toxic with changing sensibilities. “But even in its day,” Tafoya writes, “<em>Song of the South</em> was <a href="https://picturethis.museumca.org/pictures/song-south-protest">derided as racist pandering</a>, and it faced a nationwide attempt at a boycott.</p>
<p id="qPHmHM">In 2020, Disney Parks announced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/25/21303221/splash-mountain-disney-revamp-princess-and-the-frog-song-of-the-south">Splash Mountain would be replaced</a> by a ride inspired by 2009’s <em>Princess and the Frog</em>.</p>
<p id="oJfdZa">Tiana’s Bayou Adventure opens at Walt Disney World on June 28 and later this year at Disneyland. Polygon will be touring the ride ahead of its opening, so visit later this month for first-hand impressions and interviews!</p>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the most beautiful parts of building a new LEGO set is tackling it alongside someone else. If that person happens to be your significant other, it can even double as a wonderful date night or bonding experience. These 10 LEGO sets, in particular, are the best when it comes to offering ideas, themes, difficulty, or projects couples can enjoy together. </p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tranquil-garden" data-injectable="false">Tranquil Garden</h2> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Price:</strong> $109.99</li> <li><strong>Pieces:</strong> 1363</li> </ul> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">This particular LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/tranquil-garden-10315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set</a> is like a little glimpse of a tranquil Japanese garden in a corner of your home. The completed set looks great with the various cherry blossom trees and stunning a bridge. This is one of the most relaxing LEGO sets in existence, especially with the surprisingly great water pieces. Plus, there are other sets that pair nicely with it. </p>

It only has a handful of pieces compared to others, so it shouldn’t take long to make. However, the end result is an extravagant heart-shaped ornament with pink and red flowers throughout. This doubles as a great set to build together and a decoration for your home. </p>

But the one set I like the most for couples is the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/nook-s-cranny-rosie-s-house-77050?ef_id=CjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTddUudAGox-YyjLG5YqyRwm5Y0X010aLN1_VWFCeqd4oMu_ndSC7_wBoCzWYQAvD_BwE%3AG%3As&amp;s_kwcid=AL%21790%213%21%21%21%21x%21%21%2119930801640%21&amp;cmp=KAC-INI-GOOGUS-GO-US_GL-EN-RE-SP-BUY-CREATE-MB_ALWAYS_ON-SHOP-BP-PMAX-ALL-CIDNA00000-PMAX-HIGH_PRIORITY&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADESMXKrfpev75Co9J2lkOP25Nq_0&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTddUudAGox-YyjLG5YqyRwm5Y0X010aLN1_VWFCeqd4oMu_ndSC7_wBoCzWYQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nook’s Crannie &amp; Rosie’s House</a> one. This particular build lets you craft Tom Nook’s signature shop plus one of the most popular villager’s houses with Rosie. One person could tackle one building while the other completes the other, or you can work on it together.</p>

These birds are in love with one another, noted by the neat heart-shaped accessory between them. The little subtle details like the tiny hearts on the base of the set add a nice touch, plus it is one of the more affordable sets out there for couples to build together. </p>

While you can certainly build this particular set together as a couple, it would be sweet to present the already completed <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/flower-bouquet-10280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bouquet</a> to your partner — perhaps even with a vase to stick it in. </p>

The stunning cabin is a great centerpiece, giving off the perfect lakeside vacation vibes. It even comes with some autumn-themed trees in the background and a canoe boat to set the scene perfectly. This gets even better if you can build this in front of a fireplace with the mood just right. </p>

But the set doesn’t stop with just the ship. In fact, you take that ship and place it within the included bottle accessory once done. This doubles as a solid decoration for your home. You can even add your own spin on it like including a hidden message inside the bottle for someone to find someday.</p>

            <p>Curious about Destiny 2's final expansion but aren't sure where to start? One of Destiny's most dedicated fans, My name is Byf, has put together a 10-hour video to bring new players (and - let's face it - existing ones, too) up to date with the sci-fi shooter's complex storyline.</p>
<p>The video is particularly good timing given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-giving-all-playstation-and-pc-players-free-access-to-three-expansions-ahead-of-the-final-shape">Sony is giving all Playstation and PC players limited-time access to three Destiny 2 expansions</a> – The Witch Queen, Beyond Light, and Shadowkeep – ahead of The Final Shape's arrival next week. Additionally, Destiny 2's current expansion, Lightfall, is available to PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>

<p>Byf says the video details the "complete story of Destiny", from the origins of The Witness, and includes the full timeline of major events to happen in the game, as well as additional lore and backstories.</p>
<p>And there's clearly an appetite for Byf's – known in the community as "Lore Daddy" – videos.</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-the-final-shape-will-be-down-for-25-hours-before-launch">Destiny 2 will go offline for 25 hours</a> ahead of the launch of its final expansion, The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The downtime – which is scheduled to kick off at 5pm UK time on 3rd June (that's 9am PT, 12pm ET) and end at 7pm on 4th June – is required to prep for the new expansion, which is estimated to take up at least 129GB of free space on every platform, and almost 300GB on Steam.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/huge-destiny-2-the-final-shape-spoilers-leak-online-as-players-get-accidental-early-access">The Final Shape DLC has leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available</a> on PS5 earlier this week. Developer Bungie did eventually "kill" the servers, but not before spoilers about the story, raid, trophies, loot, and more – much, much more – swamped social media.</p>
<p>Bungie later acknowledged spoilers were shared online, and that a "small group of players" were able to access the campaign, Collections, Echoes, and "other reward info". It advised players who don't want the experience spoiled to "be very careful" on social media in the lead up to The Final Shape's release next week, and asked those who have seen the spoilers to "please be considerate of others".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24169013/tomb-raider-netflix-animated-series-lara-croft-release-date-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="TdYGWR"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23891556/netflix-tomb-raider-lara-croft-animated-series-release-date">Netflix’s new Tomb Raider animated series</a> will debut this October, the streaming company announced Saturday with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pF3ZbZRnRU">a new trailer for <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>. That trailer also teases what Lara’s new post-Survivor trilogy story will be about: a globetrotting adventure in search of a stolen artifact, naturally.</p>
<p id="S57eBx">According to Netflix’s official synopsis for the animated series, Lara Croft “has abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures. But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artifact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection.” On her journey, Lara will “confront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to become” in <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em>.</p>
<p id="vxt1Cr">The new series is set after the events of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/10/17838346/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc"><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em></a>, the final chapter in Crystal Dynamics’ Survivor video game trilogy — and seemingly before the events of Lara Croft’s next Tomb Raider game.</p>
<p id="cwVEPa">Powerhouse Animation, the studio behind Netflix’s <em>Castlevania</em> and <em>Master of the Universe: Revelation</em>, is producing <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22671548/netflix-tomb-raider-cast-hayley-atwell-lara-croft-voice">Hayley Atwell</a> (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23779999/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-review-part-1-tom-cruise-never-boring"><em>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning</em></a>, <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>) will voice Lara Croft in the new series. Atwell will be joined by Allen Maldonado (<em>The Wonder Years</em>) as Zip and Earl Baylon, who reprises his role as Jonah Maiava from the Tomb Raider video games.</p>
<p id="3mirGR">In addition to Netflix’s new animated series, Amazon is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/27/23574923/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-series-phoebe-waller-bridge">developing a live-action Tomb Raider series</a> with the help of writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Fleabag</em>, <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>). The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23011809/tomb-raider-new-game-unreal-engine-5">next Tomb Raider video game</a> is in development at Crystal Dynamics, and will be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23510939/tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games">published by Amazon</a> and run on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p id="fC8Q6Q"><em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> premieres on Netflix on Oct. 10.</p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Rivers of London</em> was written by author Ben Aaronovitch and is a masterful series set mostly around the city of London in the UK that blends grounded police policies, a fantastical world within our own, and Aaronovitch’s own excruciatingly precise memory for the details of London’s streets. </p> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">When I first picked this series up, I thought I’d be reading a murder mystery novel set in London that was grounded and offered a good twist ending. That’s not what I got, but I’m so glad it wasn’t because the <em>Rivers of London</em> series is so much better. The series has grown over time and now encompasses smaller novellas, meaning it can be difficult to understand what order to read them all. But don’t worry because I’ve got you covered with the definitive reading list.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-definitive-rivers-of-london-reading-order" data-injectable="false">The definitive <em>Rivers of London</em> reading order</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">The definitive <em>Rivers of London</em> reading order outlined below veers away from the published order and looks more at where the books fit in the overarching timeline. As such, you’ll be reading books out of published order, so you get all the information filled in before you move on.</p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">I think this order works because each book is approachable without necessarily having read any of the others that came before. While the novellas fill in gaps in time, they’re also better to read as you go through the series rather than waiting to go back in time because you’ll have all the information to reference what’s going on much fresher in your mind. </p> <ul data-found-items="34" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1738" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong><em>Foxes for Christmas </em>(2021)</strong> This book is actually an ebook that was released for free and can be read <a href="https://mailchi.mp/e646f1b0a7d4/ben-aaronovitch-newsletters-950322?e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </li> <li data-index="1"><strong><em>Nightingale: London 1966 – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li><strong><em>A dedicated Follower of Fashion – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong> <ul> <li data-index="2"><strong>Graphic novel #7: <em>Action at a Distance</em> (2019)</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li data-index="3"><strong><em>Rivers of London</em> (2011)</strong></li> <li data-index="4"><strong><em>The Home Crowd Advantage – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li data-index="5"><strong><em>Tobias Winter – Meckenheim 2012 – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li data-index="6"><strong><em>Moon Over Soho</em> (2011)</strong></li> <li data-index="7"><strong><em>The Domestic – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li data-index="8"><strong><em>Whispers Under Ground</em> (2012)</strong></li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>The Cockpit – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li>

 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">While I’ve included the exact stories from <strong><em>Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong> where they fit into the definitive timeline above, this series is always growing. You could definitely save that entire book for the very end, and read the above list in order without those short stories to make everything much simpler. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Note that the graphic novels, which are indented above, can be read within this order, but because they’re not the same format as the novels I don’t consider them essential. If you want to include them in your reading order, then do so where suggested as you work through the series. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Should you read the <em>Rivers of London</em> series in publication order or chronological order?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Whether you read the <em>Rivers of London</em> series in publication or chronological order is up to you. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the chronological order, which is the one listed above, but I do enjoy reading a series in publication order.</p>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">This is because the author has grown the world over the course of each book as they were released. So, if you read a series like<em> Rivers of London</em> in Chronological order, you could be missing out on the author’s knowledge of what’s to come or has already been, depending on where the books lie. </p> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">That’s just how I prefer to read, though, and with <em>Rivers of London</em>, I’m confident Aaronovitch has presented his stories in a way that actually works incredibly well when read chronologically. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Do you have to read the <em>Rivers of London</em> graphic novels to understand the story?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">The <em>Rivers of London</em> graphic novels closely follow the main story from the books, though there are some short stories that you don’t get in the major series of books. However, they’re not essential to the reading order unless you’re a diehard fan, especially because they’re a slightly different format not everyone is looking for. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">I like to think of these as accompaniments to the main series, which is why they’re offset in the reading list above. If graphic novels aren’t your thing, don’t ruin the series for yourself by forcing your way through them. Instead, read them if you know you’ll enjoy what they add to the series or just need an excuse for more graphic novels in your life. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168126/in-a-violent-nature-horror-movie-gory-moment-spine-gross-but-good<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ycUD0J">I watch a good amount of horror — I’m not as devoted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090384/best-horror-movies-2024-how-scary">as some of my colleagues</a>, but I consider myself relatively well versed in the genre, and conditioned to the depths of depravity it occasionally explores.</p>
<p id="or3ogj">I’ve also been known to enjoy gory movies, even outside of horror. I’m <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23602798/project-wolf-hunting-gory-action-horror-movie">well documented on this particular subject</a>, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens">action</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163417/kill-action-movie-thriller-indian-lakshya-train">movies</a>, where full-on gore is rare but can add extra stakes and pops of surprise to a particularly intense fight. But nothing has come close to the visceral reaction I had in response to one particularly brutal moment in the new experimental slasher movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24051853/in-violent-nature-review-sundance-horror-movie-slasher-villain"><em>In a Violent Nature</em></a>. The scene, and my reaction to it, shocked me.</p>
<p id="sG8bdz">From Canadian writer-director Chris Nash (<em>ABCs of Death 2</em>’s “Z Is for Zygote” segment), <em>In a Violent Nature </em>combines a slasher in the vein of <em>Friday the 13th</em> with the slow cinema of directors like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/20/18631794/a-hidden-life-review-terrence-malick-cannes-2019">Terrence Malick</a>. The 94-minute movie, which premiered at Sundance this January and opened in theaters on May 31, follows the point of view of its silent killer. The movie is filled with long, unbroken shots behind the killer’s shoulder as he walks through tranquil forests and fields, stalking his prey. There is no musical score. It’s a deconstruction and reinvention of the slasher genre, which largely works very well. It’s moody and atmospheric. The deliberate pacing makes the pops of gore hit even harder.</p>
<p id="keGA4B">Then we get to the scene that surprised me. I must again warn you before continuing: If you are at all squeamish, or just want to experience the gory details for yourself by watching the movie, please stop reading here. I will not judge you.</p>

<p id="LMEyfj">As the killer corners one of his victims, a young woman, near a cliff’s edge, the scene seems to be setting up a moment where she jumps to her death, or he pushes her off. Instead, the killer lodges a hook in her skull and uses the hook to pull her head down through her own stomach and out through her back. It’s extremely vivid — I get queasy just thinking about it — especially with the tremendous foley and effects work on her spine, which turns blue as the bones pop like tiny, gruesome fireworks under the strain.</p>
<p id="j4NC9s">On paper, that might sound like a cartoonish Mortal Kombat fatality. In practice, it’s startlingly real and upsetting. The combination of the contortions of the victim’s spine and the squelching and scraping noises as those bones break will continue to haunt me, which is a great credit to Nash and the entire team. </p>
<p id="rstjl3">There have been <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1578429/in-a-violent-nature-made-audience-ill/">reports of people throwing up in theaters</a> when they saw this moment, and I don’t blame them. Nash, for his part, isn’t sure whether that’s true, but he <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/in-a-violent-nature-director-audience-member-vomiting-reaction-2749600/">told Dexerto</a>, “I can’t take any pride in it, although I’m also not concerned.” If I hadn’t watched <em>In a Violent Nature</em> at home in the comfort of my couch, I could easily imagine myself joining their queasy ranks. The theater-watching experience is much more immersive, for better and for worse, depending on the movie and the audience. I could easily see this scene being overwhelming in that environment.</p>
<p id="Sj08Gr">Gore isn’t a guarantee for success in horror. It’s simply one of many tools filmmakers can use in the genre to aid a movie. But when used well, it can create unforgettable moments that permanently lodge themselves in your brain. One of the reasons I watch movies is to provoke visceral reactions. On that rubric, no movie I’ve watched in 2024 (other than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166500/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-interpretations-hope-jane-schoenbrun"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em></a>) has scored higher than <em>In a Violent Nature</em>. It’s an impressive feat for one of the year’s most fascinating movies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-dreamlight-valley-review.887286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Like grabbing a hot drink and unwinding with a good book, Disney Dreamlight Valley makes the hours pleasantly fly by. With two beefy maps to unlock and explore, more than 30 Disney characters to befriend, and a plethora of quests to complete, this Disney-infused cozy life simulator kept me blissfully entertained for dozens of hours – even having already played a whole bunch of it during its Early Access over a year ago. But despite hitting 1.0, Dreamlight Valley still feels as unfinished as it ever has in some ways thanks to persistent bugs, a newer storyline that ends on another unsatisfying cliffhanger, and a merciless grind that not even the wonderful cast of characters can entirely compensate for. That means it still has plenty more room to grow, but this effortlessly charming town game can still feel like stepping into a therapeutic hot spring all the same.</p><p>Despite a whole lot being added since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review-early-access">my initial Early Access review</a>, very little has changed about the heart of Dreamlight Valley – it shrewdly puts building social links with its iconic Disney characters front and center, then places you on a nigh-endless treadmill of relaxing fetch quests to take on (preferably while covered in a pile of blankets). It doesn’t necessarily stand up to its peers in most other regards, whether that’s its village decorating, its crafting system, or the resource gathering minigames like fishing and farming, all of which are overly simplistic and occasionally monotonous on their own. But what Dreamlight Valley continues to get right is how it makes you happy to tackle those chores when you’re doing so alongside quintessential characters from your childhood, all of whom are perfectly realized and extremely well-written.</p><p>Like a Disney-laced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing</a>, you’ll walk around town catching fish with Scar, tending to your garden with Mickey Mouse, and upgrading both your home and the village shops by giving big sacks of gold to the ever-greedy Scrooge McDuck in lieu of Tom Nook. You’ll also buy and craft furniture to decorate your abode, and build houses for your growing roster of villagers to settle down in once you’ve completed a quest to unlock each one. But unlike Animal Crossing, Dreamlight Valley focuses a lot less on completing daily rituals to earn money and much more on running quests and telling stories with its memorable cast of characters, who may ask you to deliver flowers to their love interests or investigate the dark presence that’s corrupting the valley. Even if many of those quests require grinding out resources through mining ore or picking fruit from trees, the payoff is often worth it, and adding new pals to the village and leveling up your friendship level with them through questing is very rewarding.</p><p>There’s a whole heck of a lot of characters to recruit and build bonds with, from Rapunzel, whose giddy and erratic animations are just the best, to Woody, who will sometimes hilariously decide to play dead in the middle of the level like he’s waiting for Andy to leave. My current favorite is Gaston, who is probably the best written cast member so far. Egotistical, chauvinistic, and lacking the sense God promised a goat, this guy is just the worst… so obviously I had a blast spending a bunch of time hanging out with the dim knucklehead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Adding new Disney pals to the village through questing is very rewarding.</p></div><p>Others aren’t quite as exciting, like WALL-E and EVE, who are mostly non-speaking characters that don't make for riveting company. Similarly, The Fairy Godmother and Merlin are both wise, old magicians who play very similar parental roles in the community, and I don’t know that we needed to pad out the roster with two zany fowls by including both Donald and Daisy Duck. Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas, Vannelope from Wreck-It Ralph, and even the old school legend Oswald (who was just added to the mix recently) are all much more interesting, but with so many great options to pick from, it’s odd how many of the additions feel like repeats of one another.</p><p>So far Disney Dreamlight has two major areas to explore: Dreamlight Valley itself, and the more recently added Eternity Isle that’s available as a paid DLC. Both feature the same progression system of doing village activities like cooking and gardening to get a special material that lets you unlock new areas of the map that have more characters to recruit, all while completing quests to improve your social links with said characters and progressing through each area’s self-contained stories. In the non-DLC map, that grind is mostly paced out well, with new areas and characters unlocking just as things start to get monotonous – but in Eternity Isle, it really gets dialed up to 11, with each of the three areas on the island being divided into tiny slices of space that require <em>tons </em>of a currency called Mist to unlock. Even worse, you mostly get Mist by using an item called the Royal Hourglass to play a minigame where you essentially follow a compass to find an invisible point on the map. It’s not a very compelling way to spend your time, but it at least makes for a decent distraction from watering dried out plants.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dreamlight Valley’s main story, which has you chasing down the physical embodiment of your childhood memories called The Forgetting, can now be completed in its entirety (having previously been drip fed via impressively meaty updates over its Early Access period), and deals with teenage anxiety and the joy of rediscovering childhood fancies in surprisingly poignant ways. It moves a bit slow as you go back to the grind between each major plot development, but the campaign, which took me well over 30 hours to complete, still ends up delivering a memorable tale that covers some serious topics without ever losing those essential, feel-good vibes. </p><p>Meanwhile, Eternity Isles has you repairing a ruined kingdom for a holographic Jafar who totally isn’t very clearly planning to betray you the entire time, but its story currently ends on an underwhelming cliffhanger that will presumably be wrapped up in due time like the original’s was. Where that main plot kept me interested with a central mystery that slowly revealed itself, so far Eternity Isles has played out like one of those super cliche stories where the obvious villain (who, in this case, is also literally a very recognizable villain from a Disney movie) tricks you into helping him obtain power, and I just don’t know if it’ll ever be able to pay off super well. But for right now it’s just an annoying dangling thread after hours of grinding, and at least that grinding is still as fun as it was on the mainland.</p><p>Aside from completing quests, hanging with characters, and unlocking or exploring new parts of these ever-expanding maps, you’ll also be able to visit the worlds of your real-life friends via multiplayer. While I hoped multiplayer functionality would offer a whole new way to enjoy Dreamlight Valley, it’s pretty limited in practice. You can only do very minor things while visiting, like steal your buddy’s vegetables or buy items from their shops, which might differ from your world. Having visitors or visiting someone else locks everyone’s ability to progress in the story or interact with NPCs, so the most important activities are completely gutted when you’re with a friend. For this reason, my friends and I mostly just hung out in the same Discord chat and played asynchronously, which is a bit of a bummer. It’s great that they included multiplayer at all, but its current implementation is mostly a wash.</p><p>On the other hand, a diversion that works out a little better is Scramblecoin, a board game you can play with any of the valley’s NPC residents. By placing miniatures of Disney characters onto a board and competing to see which player can gobble up the most coins, you get to wind down with a nice, little strategy game that serves as an excellent change of pace. And by accruing victories, you unlock new character pieces, each of which has its own movement patterns and special abilities with pros and cons to consider. It might not be the most challenging or sophisticated minigame, but it’s nice to be able to take a break from mindlessly fishing salmon out of the river to give your brain some exercise.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p>With how solid Disney Dreamlight Valley has shaped up to be in 2024, one thing that’s a little surprising is how many bugs I ran into after returning to it. It’s certainly not as bad as it was during the Early Access period, but I still stumbled into quite a few, whether it was buildings and furniture curiously disappearing during extended play periods, menus locking up until I backed out and reloaded, or even the occasional hard crash on Xbox. This still isn’t The Stablest Place on Earth™, but it’s not so bad that it ever actively knocked me out of that good vibe groove.</p><p>To that end, developer Gameloft Montreal has been steadfastly committed to supporting Dreamlight Valley with seasonal updates, regular patches and improvements, and new content (including characters) that continue to give me reasons to return to my beloved valley. They’ve teased both Mulan characters and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog in upcoming drops, and even while I was working on this review, added Mickey’s brother Oswald. They’ve also said that Eternity Isle’s currently incomplete story will get its finale sometime this summer, so it’ll be nice to hopefully get some payoff there.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>After more than a year since its original debut, Disney Dreamlight Valley is still pretty great, with cartoonish and colorful areas to explore and loads of charming characters to meet. Hanging out with a growing roster of Disney icons is a remarkably good time, and some of the recent additions, like Gaston, made my return to the valley an even more worthwhile venture. But a lot of the shortcomings from the Early Access days haven’t necessarily improved much either, including its habit of leaving stories on a cliffhanger ending, a monstrous grind that just don’t quit, and bugs that continue to plague an otherwise good time. Still, there’s something undeniably riveting about chilling with the goofy oddballs and loveable toons from Disney’s impressive catalog, and returning to this zen-like simulator washed my troubles away like few cozy games can.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-quirks-does-izuku-midoriya-possess-in-my-hero-academia/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-quirks-does-izuku-midoriya-possess-in-my-hero-academia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>My Hero Academia</em>‘s pitch is quite simple. It tells the story of a young powerless boy who aspires to be a superhero. Despite the numerous twists and turns, the series remains loyal to that idea. Izuku Midoriya’s hero journey started when All Might chose him to inherit One For All — the very same Quirk that allowed a Quirkless All Might to become the symbol of justice.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">Initially, One For All is thought to only grant immense strength. As such, the user’s body must be strong enough to endure the strain of releasing that much explosive power. But as the story progressed, the mysteries involving One For All slowly unraveled. It turned out that One For All not only passes superstrength from one user to another but also the Quirks the previous users wielded.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-quirks-does-deku-have" data-injectable="false">What Quirks does Deku have?</h2> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Being the ninth user of One For All, Midoriya, also known by his hero alias Deku, inherited the Quirks of the previous eight users. Given that both he and All Might were Quirkless before inheriting One For All, Midoriya only has seven Quirks in possession. The Quirks he has are <strong>One For All</strong>, <strong>Gearshift</strong>, <strong>Fa Jin</strong>, <strong>Danger Sense</strong>, <strong>Blackwhip</strong>, <strong>Smokescreen</strong>, and <strong>Float</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="891" data-injectable="true">One For All, obviously, has a complex history. It all started with All For One handing a stockpiling Quirk to his supposed Quirkless younger brother, Yoichi Shigaraki. That same stockpiling Quirk can also exponentially boost the user’s physical abilities, from strength to endurance. But unbeknownst to everyone at the time, Yoichi wasn’t actually Quirkless. He did possess a Quirk that allowed him to pass it from one user to another. This Quirk merged with the stockpiling Quirk, ultimately giving rise to One For All.</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Kudo, the second wielder of One For All, has a Quirk called Gearshift. As its name suggests, it allows the user to change the speed and/or velocity of its target. The user can use it on themselves or anything they touch. Fa Jin, the third user Bruce’s Quirk, also works in a simple manner. Fa Jin lets its user store kinetic energy, which can be released at the user’s convenience.</p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Danger Sense is perhaps Midoriya’s most-used Quirk. He may have discovered it later that One For All, but he kept the fourth user’s Quirk active at all times, especially during his stint as a dark hero. After all, Danger Sense can detect any threat within the user’s vicinity. For Midoriya, the warning comes via a stabbing sensation at the back of his head.</p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Blackwhip, the fifth user Daigoro Banjo’s Quirk, generates black tendrils that the users can manipulate as extensions of themselves. It’s the perfect Quirk to grab faraway objects ala Spiderman. It’s also the first Quirk that manifested other than One For All’s usual physical enhancements.</p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="false">The sixth user’s Quirk, Smokescreen, grants Midoriya the power to emit purple smoke, which he utilizes to obscure his opponents’ vision. The final Quirk, Float, is as simple as it comes. It gives the user the ability to remain in mid-air. Using Float jointly with the other Quirks ultimately allows Midoriya to fly.</p>

            <p>Valve has filed to trademark Deadlock, the hero shooter the company still won't confirm exists.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1796434450500419747">Gabe Follower</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/valve-has-now-filed-for-a-trademark-for-deadlock-the-hero-shooter-it-refuses-to-admit-exists/">PC Gamer</a>), <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98576353">Valve's trademark application</a> is pending approval, but the developer has applied for trademark protection for the term Deadlock across the categories of "entertainment services, namely, providing video games; provision of online entertainment, namely, online computer games; games services provided by means of the Internet". It was filed on Thursday, 30th May, 2024.</p>

<p>Of course, a trademark filing is just that, and is by no means evidence that Valve has a game of that name in development, or even proves that a game in mid-production will ever be released.</p>
<p>However, on top of the leaks that have been circulating for a couple of weeks now, it's hard to imagine this is another "Neon Prime", a different Valve trademark never came to be. Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. Shortly after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">gameplay footage also leaked</a>, showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.</p>
<p>As Tom pointed out for us at the time the leak went viral, the sci-fi setting of the game looks distinct from that of any Valve game setting so far - so no, this isn't a new Half-Life spin-off. Hopefully – with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest right around the corner</a> – we'll find out more about it soon.</p>

<p data-characters="385" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A fantastic way to watch horror as a kid — that you definitely didn’t hear from this website — is anime. Parents won’t suspect these beautifully animated stories for kids to hide some of the most messed-up stuff you can imagine, but we all know that they sure can. Let’s look at the best outings in the horror genre that we got by the hands of Japanese Animation.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Elfen Lied</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Elfen Lied’s Poster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="629" data-current-count="929" data-injectable="true">Elfen Lied has arguably the most famously gruesome opening in the history of anime. The series never reaches those all-time gory heights again, opting instead to create a very heartwarming narrative where the evil monster loses their memory and becomes the nicest creature on earth. The true horror of <em>Elfen Lied</em> lies in the constant fear of wondering if the beautiful tale will once again turn bad, because the first episode does a great job of showing just <em>how bad</em> things can turn out. Sadly, the <em>Elfen Lied</em> anime doesn’t tell the whole tale we see in the Manga, but it’s still absolutely worth your time and tears.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Parasyte</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Alien invasion stories are as common and old as the government’s attempts to keep them quiet, so there must be something special about <em>Parasyte</em> to earn it various series, live action adaptations, and even a spot on this list. </p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false"><em>Parasyte</em> rules because it shows the story of an average Joe who has to contend not just with seeing his world invaded by the slickest and scariest alien lifeforms to ever (dis)grace the world of anime, but also with being partially infected by one of these lifeforms himself. The uneasy dynamic is awesome, but so are the scares and the action scenes.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</h2> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MUBI</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">As far as vampire-themed properties go, I’d rank <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-post-apocalyptic-movies-like-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</a></em> as one of the best out of any medium. Yes, it’s up there with <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</em> and much better than whatever <em>Blade</em> movie you like the most. It features some of the most original art and best animation I’ve ever seen, and does a surprisingly good job of creating a badass vampire hunter main character who’s not all style over substance. </p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false"><em>Bloodlust</em> is a sequel of sorts to <em>Vampire Hunter D</em>, a much inferior outing that you can luckily just skip over if you want to see this one.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories aka Yami Shibai: Theatre of Darkness</h2> <figure data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"><em>Yami Shibai </em>boasts one of the most peculiar art styles out there, seemingly going all in on the classic harmless kid’s coloring book style, though it’s only using that to get your defenses down to later hit you with a gut punch.</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><em>Yami Shibai</em> features the best ratio of time spent/horror out there, as most episodes are very short, each serving almost like a quick shot of adrenaline. Best of all, there’s no shortage of small horror shots as there are already 12 seasons and counting.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Boogiepop Phantom</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="843" data-injectable="true">Boogiepop Phantom is the perfect name for a horror anime because it lures you in with a goofy name, then gets you with a spooky one. Just like a great jump scare! Jokes aside, the anime itself is just as good as its peculiar name. A strange beam of light, serial killings, monstrous superpowers, and an ancient ghost that may or may not be behind it all. <em>Boogiepop Phantom</em> uses a peculiar story structure that makes it both a great anthology that you can digest little by little, or something you can binge if you have a strong enough stomach.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Monster</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">Though it features a very traditional animation style, <em>Monster</em> is one of the most unique anime on this list. A very somber take on the genre that never betrays its calm pacing in favor of quick thrills.</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">What <em>Monster</em> intentionally lacks in jump scares, it more than makes up for with psychological horror. <em>Monster</em> invites players to go for a deep dive into the psyche of one of the vilest characters in the history of anime and manga, and they’re likely to never forget about it.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Gantz</h2> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>image via MUBI</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">As far as wild takes on sci-fi horror go, it’s hard to beat <em>Gantz</em>. It tells the story of a bunch of unlucky few who die and then somehow wake up to be forcefully employed by the titular Gantz to go on increasingly deadly missions.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Whereas most other anime would feature characters that would relish the opportunity, the characters in <em>Gantz </em>realistically have a lot of trouble dealing with what their lives have turned into. <em>Gantz</em> feels like an adaptation of a game that should exist. </p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, the series ends before telling the entire story present in the Manga, but I assure you that this half-trip is more than worth the full ticket price.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Berserk</h2> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><em>Berserk</em>, the original, not the awful series from 2015, remains one of the staples of anime. It features the grand scope that the best anime adaptation of <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> would require, and also small scale drama worthy of the great masters of old. Still, at its heart, <em>Berserk</em> is a tale of horror about how the idea of great power gets to corrupt even larger-than-life men. <em>Berserk</em> is one of the best horror stories ever told because it features great visual horror as well as some of the deepest personal horror you’ll ever encounter. </p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note, however, that <em>Berserk</em> does get too extreme with its themes and imagery at some points, and I say that not to hype readers even further. Viewer discretion is certainly advised.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Pet Shop Of Horrors</h2> <figure data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MUBI</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Do the eyes of Count D, which you can see even behind her hair, make you uneasy? Well, then you should really give <em>Pet Shop Of Horrors</em> a try, as there’s much more where that came from. Though rather short at only four episodes-long, this anthology about a possibly cursed story with a very interesting owner is very likely to entertain anyone who loves animals, and to scare straight anyone who doesn’t treat their pets like they should.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mononoke" data-injectable="false">Mononoke</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">Please do not accidentally start watching this thinking you were about to watch <em>Princess Mononoke.</em> Though both are amazing and feature brilliant animation, this one will plunge viewers into a much darker world.</p>
 <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false"><em>Mononoke</em> tells the story of a healer of sorts, one who will heal the world by facing actual demons. <em>Mononoke</em> offers a “healthy” mix of regular and psychological horror, the latter which is greatly boosted by the series’ very peculiar art style. Though far from the scariest entry on this list, <em>Mononoke</em> is the perfect example of true horror hiding behind pretty pictures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/one-punch-man-strongest-characters/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=one-punch-man-strongest-characters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>One-Punch Man</em> is known for housing some of the anime world’s zaniest characters, but don’t let their inconspicuous appearance fool you. Many of <em>One-Punch Man</em>‘s characters are <em>insanely strong</em>, to the point that obliterating Earth would be comparable to a grocery run. If you’re wondering which characters I’m talking about, then scroll on.</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Before anything else, however, a warning is necessary. Some characters and details from recent manga developments are included in this article. If you’re one of the many (me included) waiting for the elusive third season of the anime and still haven’t caught up to the manga, then don’t scroll on.</p> <figure data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-platinum-spermatozoon" data-injectable="false">10. Platinum Spermatozoon</h2> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Platinum Spermatozoon is the final form of Black Spermatozoon, and a former executive of the Monster Association. Platinum Sperm may not have the best character inspiration, but it’s undeniably one of the strongest monsters in the series. It boasts incredible speed, power, and endurance.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">During the Monster Association Arc, Platinum Sperm managed to go toe-to-toe with monsterized Garo and the S-Class Hero Flashy Flash. Their high-speed exchanges even left behind a spectacle that could teach constellations a thing or two about how to present themselves.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-9-centisennin" data-injectable="false">9. Centisennin</h2> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="true">Centisennin is the latest — and perhaps the last — centipede monster introduced in the manga. It is introduced as the “Incarnation of Father Earth,” which should show how strong Centisennin is. I mean, the Earth can’t be weak, right? Centisennin’s sheer size is already a force to be reckoned with. When it straightened itself during its fight with Garo, Centisennin easily reached the Earth’s atmosphere. However, size isn’t the only thing that makes Centisennin terrifying.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Like its younger kin, Centisennin is one tough nut to crack. Most physical attacks can’t even make a dent in its carapace, and those that can are almost instantaneously regenerated. The only means of defeating it is locating and destroying its ever-shifting regeneration core.</p> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-evil-ocean-water" data-injectable="false">8. Evil Ocean Water</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">If Centisennin is the Incarnation of Father Earth, then Evil Ocean Water is the Incarnation of Mother Ocean. Similar to the centipede, Evil Ocean Water is nearly impossible to obliterate. It’s one of the very few individuals who survived Saitama’s serious attacks. It can assimilate with any liquid, allowing it to grow massively.</p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">While it does not necessarily have the strongest attacks, Evil Ocean Water can still hold itself in a fight. After all, its water jets take down A-Class heroes without a problem.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-psychos" data-injectable="false">7. Psychos</h2> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Psychos, on her own, doesn’t deserve to belong on this list. While she’s a powerful esper in her own right, the likes of Platinum Spermatozoon would make an easy work out of her. However, that changes as she assimilates with Orochi, the Monster King.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Their fusion, also known as Psychorochi or Pyschos-Orochi, incredibly boosts Psychos’ fighting prowess. Before you say that’s cheating, it’s not (probably) since she retains control over the fusion. In that form, Psychos fended off numerous S-Class heroes. Her beam also cut a chunk of the Earth like butter.</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>screenshot via Crunchyroll Games X</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-tornado" data-injectable="false">6. Tornado</h2> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Tornado is officially known as the second-strongest hero, and she definitely gives her title justice. She’s undeniably the strongest psychic in the series, and there’s little chance that’s changing soon. Tornado can make buildings crumble without breaking a sweat and send gigantic boulders with a single thought. Heck, she twisted the entire Z-City to take down the Psychos-Orochi fusion.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via VIZ Media YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-boros" data-injectable="false">5. Boros</h2> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Boros is one of the first villains introduced in <em>One-Punch Man</em>, but that doesn’t mean he’s on the weaker side. Contrary to that, many fans believe Boros is the strongest opponent Saitama faced. And there may be some truth to that.</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Boros is a born fighter. He is so strong that he has to wear restraining armor and scour the universe to find someone to rival his might. As a testament to his strength, Boros, in his Meteoric Burst Form, sent Saitama to the Moon with a single knee strike.</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Blast</h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Acknowledged as the strongest hero by the Hero Association, Blast is certainly one of the strongest characters in the series. Unfortunately, Blast’s full capability is yet to be shown. Nonetheless, what little we know about his character is enough to put him in fourth place. After all, Blast is the only hero other than Saitama who could give Cosmic Fear Mode Garo a good fight. </p> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-garo" data-injectable="false">3. Garo</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Starting as a genius martial artist, Garo’s rise to power is a sight to behold. What makes Garo terrifying is his almost limitless potential. Not only can he adapt to almost any situation, but he can also make his enemies’ abilities his own.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, he can only go too high. Despite giving Saitama the greatest fight of his life (yet), he ultimately fails to take down the bald hero. Even so, it’s undeniable that Garo can take down those listed above by imitating Saitama’s Killer Move series.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-god" data-injectable="false">2. God</h2> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">God is perhaps the most enigmatic character in the entire series. Little is known about its character, but what we know of this individual (or is it individuals?) is that they’re really damn strong.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Living up to their name, God bestows divine power to those their chosen ones. That’s how Homeless Emperor became a powerhouse despite being a nobody. But God isn’t all benevolent. Taking that scrumptious-looking divine power comes with a high cost. The moment God changes their mind and retrieves that power back, almost nothing remains from the victim.</p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-saitama" data-injectable="false">1. Saitama</h2> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">As the titular character, Saitama is undeniably the strongest in his verse. He obliterates each and every one of his opponents with a single punch. Well, except Garo, who he defeated with his causality-defying Zero Punch.</p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="false">Probably the only existence in the entire series who can match Saitama’s power level is God. Both characters’ feats defy logic. But given that Saitama already learned how to harness God’s power once, there’s a great chance he can do it again to give God’s smug face a good beating. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-game-might-release-this-year-says-jeff-grubb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported </a>earlier this year via rumors, Sony announced a new Astro Bot game coming to PlayStation 5 on September 6. Following the State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a>, Team Asobi Creative Director Nicolas Doucet talked about the game in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/astro-bot-2024-game-playstation-cameos-exclusive-8655347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, describing the new Astro Bot as the studio's biggest-ever game thanks to eighty levels spread across six planets.</p>
<p><em>The charm of Astro and how he resonated with people went beyond what we expected. At that point, we decided to make a big game. We wanted to make a big game. This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story. We call it Astro Bot because we treat this as a new beginning. That's a really, really big game. I think for us, that's the biggest game we've ever made.</em></p>
<p><em>The core effort has gone into making Astro's own game so that he can stand on his own feet as a new PlayStation character with a good reputation and confidence. But also on top of that, there is this whole coating of nostalgia.</em></p>
<p>This makes sense since Team Asobi <a href="https://wccftech.com/team-asobi-gets-bigger-will-work-on-a-franchise-for-all-ages-with-global-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got larger</a> three years ago in preparation for this game. Astro Bot&nbsp;will feature lots of cameos from other PlayStation characters. Just in the reveal trailer, we've seen Kratos from God of War. Doucet added:</p>
<p><em>It's a kind of eye candy. There's going to be more. We're going to be talking over time about what they mean to the game, but, yes, there's going to be a big reunion. There's a lot of characters from the PlayStation universe crossing over with Astro's path. It's an Astro Bot story, of course, with Astro being the main character, but there's a lot of PlayStation characters that play a part.</em></p>
<p>There will be many other nods to different franchises and stories, too.</p>
<p><em>I would say it's pop culture in general in a very broad sense. That's something we've always done as part of our games — look at iconic real-world inspirations, a lot of them from Hollywood movies or famous animation — and looking at themes that really cross generations.</em></p>
<p>Are you looking forward to this new game? Let us know below.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24168298/halt-catch-fire-video-games-anniversary-best-show</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halt-and-catch-fire-understood-video-games-better-than-any-other-show.887265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168298/halt-catch-fire-video-games-anniversary-best-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vLrnuU">Despite numerous advances in the medium, video games largely remain something of a (usually solitary) frivolity, at least when it comes to on-screen depictions. Even when a show is ostensibly <em>about</em> games — your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23166678/players-review-league-of-legends-paramount-plus"><em>Players</em></a>, your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/23205812/mythic-quest-season-3-teaser"><em>Mythic Quest</em></a>s — it’s really all about the interactions that occur outside the games, or the process of their creation. </p>
<p id="n6ZrzH"><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> would appear to fit into this. The much-beloved AMC show made no secret of the fact that it was never really about the technology covered in a season; in the words of Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), the computer was always “the thing that gets us to the thing,” a vector for connection, expression, or some other deeper human need. In that way, <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> understands the draw of video games better than any show that’s come before it. </p>
<p id="emMy01">It would first demonstrate this in its second season when — in the aftermath of a scandal and a company liquidation — Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis) left computer company Cardiff Electric to form Mutiny, a primitive attempt at online gaming. The seed for the rest of the season comes when Donna Clark (Kerry Bishé) notices two players still connected after finishing a game, spurring the creation of a chat board. Even with the limitations of dial-up and 1-bit graphics, people still found ways to communicate. </p>
<p id="Zgu53d">Many shows set in the ’80s would feature <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24001610/super-mario-bros-speedrun-nintendo-nes-tool-assisted-niftski"><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on the NES</a>. But not many would follow two adults over the course of several days trying to beat it, giving tips on how to get past a tricky area, and trading off when one gets tired so they don’t have to restart the long ordeal again, all ending with them having grown closer to each other as well as with a deeper understanding of the people in their orbits. It’s less about nostalgia and more proving how technology — no matter how rudimentary — can lead to moments of insight and catharsis. </p>
<div id="D5Jevx"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb7SGxtu2P4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="4plYYa">Season 4 takes this idea and furthers the distance: Cam has released a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/myst/6576"><em>Myst</em></a><em>-</em>like game called <em>Pilgrim</em> that no one seems to understand. No one, that is, except for Donna, who solves it all on her own. By this point in the show, Cam and Donna have had a falling out, whatever bond they had shared that made them such great co-owners destroyed by hubris and backstabbing. It’s a beautiful scene, one that taps into Cam’s desire to make a sort of higher art form through her games, and Donna remembering when she used to actually <em>do </em>something, problem solving rather than funding projects. It spurs on their hasty reconnection, and one of <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>’s many strengths is the willingness to let each part of the ensemble be the villain for a season or so. Donna’s betrayal still stings; she’s pushing people to make a competitor to her friends’ new company. But there’s always an understanding of where someone’s coming from, and in this case, it’s a desire — subconscious or otherwise — to apologize and fix a relationship that might be broken beyond repair. <em>Pilgrim </em>is a perfect symbol for their relationship, and the idea that there can be 100 people who play your game, but you just need one person who understands it. </p>
<p id="olk3sG"><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> excels at these small moments of beauty, sometimes as simple as the way a certain line is read. Video games aren’t always the main plotline, but it understands the inherent draw of them, both in their communal aspects and artistic prospects. After all, what is a game like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/outer-wilds-guide/2019/7/19/20700735/beginners-tips-timer-nova-puzzles-explore-mystery-ship-log-damage-repair-heal"><em>Outer Wilds</em></a> but an attempt to draw you into the minds of the creators while simultaneously leaning on others for support? The characters may have failed and failed again over the course of the show, but they’ll never stop searching for that burst of connection no matter where it might be found. </p>
<p id="7bsOo8"><small><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em></small><small> is streaming on The Roku Channel and AMC Plus.</small></p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the world of <em>Demon Slayer</em>, the Demon Slayer Corps is humanity’s last line of defense against Kibutsuji Muzan and his man-eating army. Unfortunately, however, not all Demon Slayers can hold their ground against the vile monstrosities. </p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">The average Demon Slayer may be able to fight and even eliminate lower-ranked demons on their own, but they are helpless prey to stronger ones, especially the Upper Ranks. The only Demon Slayers who can match these powerful monsters are the Hashira.</p> <h2 id="h-the-hashira-are-the-strongest-demon-slayers" data-injectable="false">The Hashira are the strongest Demon Slayers</h2> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">The Hashira is the highest achievable rank for a Demon Slayer. Unlike many organizations, the Hashira title is earned and not just handed out, especially since the Hashira are the strongest warriors among all the Demon Slayers.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Hashira Training Arc  |  OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7w5Vfjozzb8?list=PLrNN1YufWexzXXmqHKw_MMuP3J44jhQ-W" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Each Hashira is a master of a Breathing Style, which can either be taught to them or developed by them. They are strong enough to make easy work of the average demons, as well as hold their ground against Muzan’s strongest henchmen — the Twelve Demon Moons.</p>
 <p data-characters="66" data-current-count="66" data-injectable="false">When Tanjiro joined the corps, there were nine Hashira. They were:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"> <li>Kyojuro Rengoku – Flame Hashira</li> <li>Tengen Uzui – Sound Hashira </li> <li>Mitsuri Kanroji – Love Hashira</li> <li>Gyomei Himejima – Stone Hashira</li> <li>Muichiro Tokito – Mist Hashira</li> <li>Obanai Iguro – Snake Hashira</li> <li>Giyu Tomioka – Water Hashira</li> <li>Shinobu Kocho – Insect Hashira</li> </ul> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, Rengoku was felled by Akaza and Tengen was incapacitated during the Entertainment District Arc. In the latest season of the anime, the Hashira Training Arc, only seven Hashira remain active.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-become-a-hashira" data-injectable="false">How to become a Hashira?</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">To become a Hashira, a Demon Slayer must prove their capabilities. There are two known ways to do that. The first is to either slay 50 demons while still at Kinoe rank or defeat a Demon Moon. The other option is to become a Hashira’s Tsuguko, which is basically both their protégé and successor.</p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Becoming a Tsuguko is also a task of its own. It’s a position that can be applied for, but it is ultimately up to the Hashira whether to accept the application. The Hashira may also scout and recruit their own Tsuguko, as what Rengoku tried to do to Tanjiro. </p>
 <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false">While becoming a Tsuguko almost guarantees becoming a Hashira, that will only come to fruition should the Tsuguko’s respective Hashira perish or retire.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-kagaya-ubuyashiki%E2%80%99s-illness-in-demon-slayer.887256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-kagaya-ubuyashikis-illness-in-demon-slayer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-is-kagaya-ubuyashikis-illness-in-demon-slayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="174" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that <em>Demon Slayer </em>is all about demon slaying. However, that is easier said than done, as those actual demons are in no way weak. </p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Eliminating even the tiniest of demons is already a laudable feat; which is why the titular group constantly hones its forces in preparation to face the mightiest of foes. But, interestingly enough, the one at its helm is not a swordsman with unparalleled skills but a dying man named Kagaya Ubuyashiki. </p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Kagaya Ubuyashiki has always been painted as physically pained. Despite attempting to train himself in swordsmanship, his body simply cannot endure the physical strain. And in the latest season of the <em>Demon Slayer </em>anime, the Hashira Training Arc, Kagaya has become too weak to even sit down and face the Hashira. So, what’s actually plaguing him?</p>
 <h2 id="h-kagaya-ubuyashiki-is-cursed" data-injectable="false">Kagaya Ubuyashiki is cursed</h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Kagaya isn’t the first Ubuyashiki to suffer from this condition, and that’s because Kagaya isn’t merely dealing with a disease but, a curse — a curse so potent that it affects the entire Ubuyashiki bloodline. The curse stems from the fact that Kibutsuji Muzan, the forefather of demons, shares a blood relation with the Ubuyashiki Clan from a thousand years back.</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">The curse causes the Ubuyashikis’ bodies to be physically weak and continuously deteriorate. The spreading scars on Kagaya’s face are a manifestation of that curse. Now that the curse has already spread down to Kagaya’s body and hands, he no longer has the strength to get up. </p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="false">Given their physique, most of the Ubuyashikis don’t live to 30. The curse is also more fatal for males, as the other Ubuyushakis have the option to escape their accursed fate by marrying outside the family at the age of 13. Even though their circumstances are quite dire, all hope is not lost. There’s a way to dispel the curse. All they have to do is eliminate the source of the curse — Kibutsuji Muzan himself. As such, the Ubuyashiki family has made it their mission to kill the Demon King once and for all.</p>

            <p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's stunning soundtrack is now available to buy as a custom CD boxset.</p>
<p>Comprising of over 300 tracks across nine CDs that run for 11 hours, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Legend-Zelda-Kingdom-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0D2RZGSTS/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Original Soundtrack</a> is set to release on 12th July (in the UK at least – other territories will vary) for a formidable £230.</p>

<p>"A total of 344 songs on 9 CDs, including songs from the game and songs used in trailers," explains the item description. "The total recording time is approximately 11 hours.</p>
<p>This edition includes "a three-sided luxury box with tall size digipak" and "a sword-shaped USB, which contains high-resolution and 5.1-channel sound sources, allowing you to experience the magnificent game world in greater depth and higher definition".</p>

<p>Each disc includes markings familiar to anyone who's spent time with the game, and comes in a hefty box to keep the CDs safe. However, the Master Sword USB that contains digital copies of the tracks is likely to be the main draw for most fans.</p>
<p>If you don't have a spare £200 hanging around, you can still enjoy the soundtrack on popular streaming services like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6VQ05hTl7qZGLVuAv0PsRn?si=d69d98f05f024211">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-just-dropped-another-batch-of-brilliant-game-soundtracks-onto-spotify">Sony also recently added the soundtracks for games like Gravity Rush, Shadow of the Colossus, Wild Arms, and PoPoLoCrois</a> to Spotify and other streaming platforms, joining other free-to-stream OSTs for games like Bloodborne, Destiny, Elden Ring, Silent Hill, and Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>"For Breath of the Wild, Nintendo <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/breath-of-the-wild-composers-on-changing-up-zeldas-music-formula-and-more/">lightened the soundtrack</a> even as it brushed away the heavily telegraphed optional activities that fill most open worlds, reducing the musical component to a troupe of travelling performers who seem as lost in this landscape as you are," Eurogamer contributor, Edwin, wrote in his fantastic feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-tears-of-the-kingdom-match-the-sly-genius-of-breath-of-the-wilds-music">Can Tears of the Kingdom match the sly genius of Breath of the Wild's music?</a></p>
<p>"Sometimes the piano feels like it's trying to play you, in multiple senses. It wants you to feel pleasantly lost in a world whose smiling desolation is always bringing you to a halt, mesmerised, even as every curve of the road throws up some gently magnetic object of interest. Other times, it sounds like it's reacting to your movements, swept along behind as you race for the next landmark, or knocked askew as you slide off the critical path to investigate a cracked rockface. One of the great surprises of Breath of the Wild, for me, was learning that while the soundtrack is layered and dynamic - it has escalating tiers of combat music, for instance - the piano isn't fully context-sensitive."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>One Piece</em> has a number of spinoff mangas. These range from sharing Ace’s story to following Sanji as he cooks delectable meals for his friends. The stories provide windows into the lives of side characters while also providing various art styles starkly contrasting with the main series. </p> <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">Without much ado, here is an explanation of every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-piece-chapter-1116-release-date-time-and-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em> manga</a> spinoff, all of which can be found on <a href="https://www.viz.com/search?search=one+piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VizMedia</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-ace-s-story" data-injectable="false">Ace’s Story</h2> <figure data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | One Piece: Ace’s Story—The Manga | VIZ" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpaga_3BWfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Ace’s Story begins by following Ace on his pirating adventures before joining the White Beard Pirates. To avoid heavy spoilers, I won’t discuss the plot details or nuances. I will say that, as a fan of both Ace and <em>One Piece</em> as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this spinoff and highly recommend it. </p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">The art is drawn by Boichi. Many of you may be familiar with his work, as he also draws for <em>Dr. Stone</em>. This particular artist shines thanks to his attention to detail, showcased through his gorgeous and incredibly consistent panel work. Though very different from Eichiro Oda’s own art style, the mangaka’s style exceptionally highlights Ace’s personality. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Naoshi Komi Covers Vivi’s Adventure</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">This particular one-shot is a redraw of a preexisting manga chapter. As the title states, Naoshi Komi covers Vivi’s adventure. Specifically, they cover chapter 216. For those unaware, Naoshi Komi is the artist for <em>Nisekoi</em>, a romance manga. </p>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Unlike Boichi’s art, which utilizes harsh lines to highlight details, Naoshi Komi’s recreation of <em>One Piece</em> utilizes smooth lines to create a soft mood. This spinoff doesn’t provide any new narrative or lore but rather allows you to relive a favorite moment in a different light. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Boichi Sensei covers the Zolo vs. Mihawk Battle</h2> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Similar to the previous entry, <em>Boichi Sensei covers the Zolo vs. Mihawk Battle</em> is a redrawing of a preexisting event in the original manga, again illustrated by Dr. Stone artist Boichi. The art is incredibly detailed and provides a vastly different reading experience compared to Eichiro Oda’s typical weekly entries. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Shokugeki no Sanji </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | Shokugeki no Sanji | VIZ" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AQ9HM4XYpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">Are there any <em>Food Wars</em> fans here? I have great news for you. Shun Saeki, the artist for <em>Shokugeki no Soma</em>, gives Sanji a new life. He creates incredibly fancy dishes, dazzling all those lucky enough to feast on his masterpieces. The narrative is set before Sanji joins the Straw Hat Pirates. </p>
 <p data-characters="92" data-current-count="92" data-injectable="false">The artist created it while participating in an event to promote and commemorate <em>One Piece</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Monsters</h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">To be honest, I might be stretching it a bit by calling <em>Monsters </em>a <em>One Piece</em> manga spinoff. In actuality, this is a one-shot Eichiro Oda made before <em>One Piece,</em> and it doesn’t make its relation to <em>One Piece </em>too obvious. However, most <em>One Piece</em> fans don’t realize the character in Monsters is referenced a number of times. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The main character of <em>Monsters</em> has the same name as Ryoma, a legendary swordsman from <em>One Piece</em>. This is the skeleton Brook’s shadow takes over on Thriller Bark. According to <em>One Piece</em>, Ryoma is a samurai from Wano Kingdom who slays a dragon. In <em>Monsters</em>, he’s a wandering ronin. </p>

EA Sports also introduced the TOTS lineup from the women’s leagues, along with names from the rest of the world. The list of available choices has never been longer, which also makes it tricky to identify the best <em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players for all positions.</p> <h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-24-tots-players-by-position" data-injectable="false">Best EA FC 24 TOTS players by position</h2> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Thanks to the vast number of TOTS cards released in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-felipe-anderson-end-of-an-era-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>, every position is pretty well covered. EA Sports has also released TOTS Plus items, which make it easier for players to keep squad chemistry pretty high even if they’re using items from the Mixed Leagues.</p>

 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Do note that some of the best <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-players-to-use-in-ea-fc-24-ultimate-tots-glow-up-evolution/"><em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players</a> are available in packs as of writing. The Ultimate TOTS has reintroduced some of the best items, so it makes a lot of sense to open all your saved packs. You can also buy these items from the market, but most of them are pretty costly (despite the higher supply from packs).</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Additionally, new End of an Era and Flashback SBCs will be released every day during Ultimate TOTS. These cards have great stats, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-thiago-silva-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Thiago Silva EOAE item</a> is undoubtedly among the better defenders currently available in Ultimate Team.</p>

  <p id="utJfhi">Happy June, Polygon readers. The weather is heating up, the sun is shining more brightly, and you’re probably doing activities outside a bit more. Good for you! But there’s still plenty of cause to plop on the couch, fire up the AC, pop some corn, and watch some great movies.</p>
<p id="vs336a">Every month, we collect the best movies new to streaming on Netflix, Hulu, Max, Prime, and more. This June, it’s a good group. We’ve got an underrated John Carpenter thriller newly on the Criterion Channel, two standout early works from directors with big releases this summer, and more.</p>

<p id="TRcBF9"><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Criterion Channel<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Action thriller<br><strong>Director: </strong>John Carpenter<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer</p>
<p id="Kdvbem">Often imitated but never outdone, John Carpenter’s 1976 crime thriller is one of the tensest 91 minutes ever put on screen, and now it’s on the Criterion Channel as a part of its “Synth Soundtracks” collection. Carpenter’s second feature film (following <em>Dark Star</em>, and just two years before <em>Halloween </em>changed everything), the movie follows a police officer (Austin Stoker) and a convicted murderer (Darwin Joston) who team up to defend the titular precinct from a heavily armed street gang.</p>
<p id="bfVPUU">Made on a shoestring budget of approximately $100,000, the original <em>Assault on Precinct 13 </em>is a master class of efficient filmmaking, using the closed-in setting of the movie to maximum effect in building tension and staging action sequences. It’s also an early peek at many of the skills that would make Carpenter one of the great masters of genre filmmaking. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="GdXYpc"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dramedy<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sean Baker<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, James Ransone</p>
<p id="NMn6bX">Director Sean Baker just became the first American to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/25/nx-s1-4981452/anora-wins-palme-dor-cannes-film-festival">win the Palme d’Or</a> since Terrence Malick won for <em>The Tree of Life </em>in 2011. Baker’s new movie, <em>Anora</em>, follows a sex worker (Mikey Madison) in a difficult relationship with a Russian oligarch. It does not yet have a release date in the U.S., but that big award win is a great reason to revisit one of Baker’s early projects, <em>Tangerine —</em> another story about sex workers, but in a very different style.</p>
<p id="UB1su5">Shot on three iPhone 5S phones, <em>Tangerine </em>follows two trans sex workers in Los Angeles who are the closest of friends. One just got out of a short stint in prison and has heard her boyfriend has been cheating on her. The two try to find him and get down to the bottom of this mystery in a raw and funny dramedy that looks gorgeous despite the technological limitations of the equipment. If you liked Baker’s later films — <em>The Florida Project </em>and <em>Red Rocket —</em> or are looking forward to the Palme d’Or-winning <em>Anora</em>, but haven’t made time for <em>Tangerine</em>, now’s your moment. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="1TaQ12"><strong>Genre: </strong>Romantic comedy<br><strong>Director: </strong>Mike Nichols<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith</p>
<p id="FikyIN">Mike Nichols’ (<em>The Graduate</em>)<em> </em>1988 rom-com classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and acting nominations for Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, and Joan Cusack. A class comedy about a secretary who fills in for her injured boss only to have said boss try to take credit for her hard work, this is a breezy comedy with an outstanding cast that also serves as a bit of a time capsule for late 1980s New York City, and makes an excellent companion piece to <em>9 to 5</em>.</p>
<p id="kUK17p"><em>Working Girl</em> also inspired a particularly funny episode of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>: the season 5 premiere “Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl,” a mashup of <em>Working Girl </em>and <em>Die Hard</em>. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="KSnzFi"><strong>Genre: </strong>Drama<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Isaac Chung<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, Alan Kim</p>
<p id="NNGE2J">Lee Isaac Chung’s <em>Minari</em> is an American story in the purest sense: Jacob (Steven Yeun), a Korean American father with dreams of a better life for himself and his children, moves his family from California to Arkansas in pursuit of his dream of becoming a farmer. As they weather the challenges and hardships that come with this strange new life in the Ozarks, he and his family learn the true meaning of what it takes to build a home. From our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21538912/best-movies-2020">best movies of 2020</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="LTneWs">Novelistic and warmly rendered, Minari is a drama about everyday life, and remembering to see the gifts of what’s right in front of you. And the perspective comes from a top-tier cast: Along with Yeun, playing a piercing patriarch, Han Yeri delivers a touching performance as a mother holding fast to her wayward loved ones, newcomers Noel Cho and Alan S. Kim buck every bad trope to play goofy and lovable kids, and renowned Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn solidifies her legacy in a film that is wholly American.</p></blockquote>

<p id="wkoA5L"><strong>Genre: </strong>Documentary<br><strong>Director: </strong>Godfrey Reggio</p>
<p id="JeuyQe">Consisting primarily of time-lapsed footage of cities and natural environments, <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> is a fascinating time capsule of 20th-century society on the verge of the new millennium, one which asks its audiences to consider the symbiotic relationship between human beings and Earth and whether or not, as the English translation of the film’s title suggests, life as we know it has been thrown out of balance.</p>
<p id="VPY1to">The movie has gone on to be referenced and parodied countless times since its premiere in 1982, including in the 2007 announcement trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80K51DosFo"><em>Grand Theft Auto 4</em></a>, which features a track from Philip Glass’ iconic score for the film. Make the time to appreciate this monolith of majestic introspective filmmaking. <em>—TE </em></p>
