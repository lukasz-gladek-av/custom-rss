You'll be able to find out for yourself when the collection, <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/bubsy-in-the-purrfect-collection-standard-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">from Atari and Limited Run Games</a>, hits Switch on <strong>9th September</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, being a Limited Run Games joint, there's a few options on physical versions to choose from here too, with a <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>Deluxe</strong> and <strong>Im-Paw-Sible</strong> editions, as shown below.</p>

<p>Here's some further details from the press release:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/sony-inzone-h9-ii-une-nouvelle-version-du-casque-gaming-sans-fil-arrive-bientot-60393">Billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, Sony is set to reveal a new headset in its Inzone lineup of accessories at Gamescom 2025, with the Inzone H9 II, the successor to 2022's Inzone H9, potentially being announced during Gamescom 2025's ONL Showcase.</p>



<p>The Inzone line of accessories was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-monitors-headsets-accessories-evo-2022/">first launched in 2022,</a> with Sony releasing headphones and monitors and then showcasing them during EVO 2022. We've already had a follow-up release of monitors, with Sony releasing OLED variants of its Inzone monitor line.</p>



<p>Dealabs also includes a spec chart for the new rumored H9 II headphones, which shows a few significant changes like the new model having a detachable mic, support for the latest Bluetooth standard, and weighing far less than the original H9 headphones.</p>

<p>As far as price is concerned, Dealabs reports that the H9 II headphones will set you back <strong>€349.99</strong>, with pre-orders set to go live when its revealed during Gamescom ONL. Dealabs doesn't include a specific release date prediction, but does suggest that it'll be out sometime in early September.</p>



<p>While it's important to remember that all of this information is, at the time of this writing, not verified and still a rumor, Billbil-kun and Dealabs have built a strong reputation for accurately reporting retail information ahead of official announcements.</p>



<p>We'll know by this time next week if their reputation continues to be just as strong.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-15-censorship</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-seemingly-censors-game-and-angers-fans.1271181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>are flocking to Steam to leave negative reviews owing to what appears to be an attempt at censoring some of the game's content in its latest update.</p>

<p>As noted by none other than Soulslike aficionado and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>modder</a> Lance McDonald on <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1955675217680105798" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-broken-by-a-push-to-censorship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>), Update 1.5, which was released recently, changes the game so that it's impossible to "kill any historically significant bosses or NPCs".</p>

<p>Instead, according to McDonald, these enemies and bosses simply "get 'exhausted' and relax after the fight and talk to you". It also seems as though a Pray emote, taught to the player by a Portuguese Christian missionary during the course of the game, has been removed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-censorship-boss.jpg?itok=ZQO3C6gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-censorship-boss.jpg?itok=pUjKBB7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>update is provoking ire amongst the game's community.</figcaption></figure><p>According to McDonald,&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>' fourth chapter is now "insanely easy" because half of the chapter's enemies will no longer attack you, and you also can't attack them, so a vast portion of that chapter's challenge has been removed.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game's protagonist now also apparently pledges to "continue [the] legacy" of bosses she defeats, which, as McDonald notes, "literally ruin[s] the entire point of the game's plot about impermanence".</p>

<p>There are many more examples of these kinds of changes throughout McDonald's social media thread, and I'd recommend reading it if you want to know what's different after the update.</p>

<p>The official patch notes themselves don't really make reference to these changes, either; there's a brief note about adding "dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots" and "further optimiz[ing] the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance", but nothing concrete.</p>




<p>Needless to say, these changes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">haven't exactly thrilled</a> Steam users, with many leaving negative reviews decrying&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322527246/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"sudden"</a> plot changes, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/saint-in-chief/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"censorship"</a>, and attempts to appease <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030735475/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"whiny Chinese nationalists"</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, those complaints now appear to have overtaken the very "nationalist" ire the update was seemingly intended to address. Whether or not Leenzee will make further changes remains to be seen, but it does seem as though&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>has been significantly changed through Update 1.5.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to check out the game, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9NPRHD8GQKQS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as a Game Pass title.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is the first game in the franchise to move from turn-based battles to real-time combat, and it sounds like it will take some getting used to. The first gameplay was revealed to content creators and critics ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, where it became clear developer Game Freak is unafraid <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-trailer-mega-evolution-az-1851766880">to change-up some decades-old formulas</a>.</p> <p>The demos were brief, split between 10 minutes of regular trainer battles and 10 minutes of a raid-like encounter against a Mega Evolution Abso. Unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-tone-nintendo-swit-1848478468">in 2022’s<em> Arceus</em></a>, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has you move around a battle in real-time, telling your Pokémon which moves to use or when to get out of the way at will. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/"><em>VGC</em> noted</a> that you can even sneak up on enemy trainers to get an advantage in battle, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>The Verge</em> compared</a> the Mega Evolution showdown to “a classic 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>boss.” Your trainer can even take damage herself during these battles.</p> <p>You can see what they’re describing in some of the hands-on footage from <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii <em>Pokémon</em> expert</a> Joe Merrick:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A Demo WORLD FIRST Exclusive Preview" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bjZLO8cKyw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions"><em>IGN</em>‘s preview</a>, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> makes some other drastic departures from series’ staples, like getting rid of PP points and relying on ability cooldowns instead. This lets you use any attack an unlimited number of times, but only once its meter is full. “<em>Legends: Z-A</em> didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening,” writes Casey DeFreitas.</p> <p>Like everyone else, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-trying-out-real-time-and-mega-evolution-fights/"><em>CNET</em> demoed</a> the game on <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">Switch 2 in docked mode</a> and noticed “no performance hiccups.” Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-with-overhauled-battles-and-denser-exploration-im-shocked-at-how-fundamentally-fresh-this-could-feel/"><em>Gamesradar</em> was</a> underwhelmed by the urban playground <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>&nbsp; takes place in “The streets and rooftops are bare and lack personality and, while appearing to be a bustling metropolis, Lumiose City is strangely quiet. The limited character animations are also quite noticeable,” writes Michael Leri. “It does make me wonder if the game is underwhelming in these areas because<em> Z-A</em> is still chained to the archaic original Switch compared to its more powerful successor.”</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> might still be visually hemmed in by the franchise’s history, it sounds like the city’s map still shows it being densely packed with points of interest. Combined with reworked moves to cater to the real-time flow of combat and mechanics like collecting orbs of energy in fights to trigger your own Pokémon’s Mega Evolutions, it feels like at the very least, this year’s release, the first new one in three years, is taking some fresh risks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Once more unto the breach. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, and more, is here. This morning we’re looking at a second screen for the Switch 2 and a wider Steam, we’ve got good news about that new <em>Mafia</em> game, and the devs behind<em> Battlefield 6</em> are making some changes to the beta. Oh, and don’t worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspBUfY8IKs">we’re getting a new video game based on <em>Chicken Run</em></a>. I know everyone was waiting for that.</p> <h2><strong>Rush in the <em>BF6</em> open beta isn’t a great experience</strong></h2> <p>The<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta is back for its second and final weekend</a>, and that’s great. This weekend also sees a new mode join the fun, Rush, which is a classic <em>BF</em> mode. Sadly, Rush in the beta is bad. I played a few matches last night and didn’t enjoy it. Maps are too small, points are too close, and attackers are at a big disadvantage when trying to blow up the MCOM stations.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MCOM Timer Changes to Rush</p> <p>We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players.</p> <p>We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments.</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA seems to get that Rush isn’t working, and a few hours after the beta went live, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143">the team changed how long it takes to blow up an MCOM station with a bomb</a>. Previously, it took 45 seconds, which gave defenders plenty of time to run in and defuse it. Now it takes 30 seconds, which should help. But if this mode is going to join my rotation in the full game in October, more changes will have to be made.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam game pages are getting wider&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Don’t be alarmed if soon store pages on Steam look a bit wider. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">Valve is testing out some new options</a> for developers and publishers that will let them customize and alter how store pages for games look on the popular digital storefront. Valve is also testing out the option to let devs upload high-quality videos to the store page instead of just gifs. Hopefully this makes store pages look nicer and doesn’t turn Steam into a giant mess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is selling really well</strong></h2> <p>2K’s linear action game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a></em>&nbsp;has received fairly good reviews and seems to be a hit with fans of the franchise. But more importantly for the bean counters at 2K, the new <em>Mafia</em> sequel, which is actually set before all the other games in the series, is selling like hotcakes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf/">According to some data shared by Sensor Tower</a>, <em>The Old Country</em> has already sold 800,000 units in just two weeks. PS5 and PC are the biggest platforms for the game. Hopefully this is good news for Hangar 13, and they can avoid layoffs.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em> devs now own the franchise</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718?l=english">On August 14</a> Blackbird Interactive, developers behind spaceship salvage sim <em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker,</em> announced that it had bought back the rights to the game and the franchise from publisher Focus Entertainment. The devs also announced that they were now working on multiple projects within the <em>Hardspace</em> universe and promised a small <em>Shipbreaker</em> update in the future that will tweak some things to reflect the new ownership.</p>

 <p>“We’re eternally grateful for [Focus Entertainment’s] partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the <em>Hardspace</em> IP,” said Blackbird Interactive.</p> <h2><strong>WNBA stars will be able to play with NBA stars in <em>2K26</em></strong></h2> <p>While women players from the WNBA have been a part of the <em>NBA 2K</em> series for a few years now, the latest game in the franchise will let them compete against NBA stars for the first time ever. <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k26/courtside-report/myteam/">This will be possible only in <em>NBA 2K’</em>s popular (and profitable) MyTeam mode</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">What I'd consider the best parts of horror in games aren't jump scares or gruesome monsters chasing you, rather an eerie atmosphere or a lingering feeling of dread – knowing something is a little <em>off</em>. I've long heralded the 2008 cult-classic OFF, an RPG Maker (2003) game from developer Mortis Ghost, for how it wields its lo-fi art style to evoke that powerful sense of dread and reveal things that are truly horrifying. As a small-scale game that only had an English version via fan translation in 2011, this official remaster in 2025 is important for preserving an influential retro-style RPG, especially as it is largely faithful to the original. In some respects, it hasn't aged quite as gracefully as I'd hoped (partially due to the hindsight of having played so many amazing games it inspired in the years since), but OFF's blend of goofiness embedded in a deeply unsettling story has stood the test of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF is one of those games where its limitations are part of its strengths. Color and the absence of it are used to shift the vibe of the overworld in chilling ways as you progress. The hand-drawn sketch-like character designs give a deranged look to enemies that complements their desolate, off-kilter world. And the low-tech pixel art has a way of being a powerful tool for creating a foreboding atmosphere, letting your imagination tease out an underlying psychological horror. These are some of OFF's defining features, and also remain effective as you unravel its disturbing truths.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You control The Batter, a guy rocking a baseball uniform and armed with a bat who is ready to hit some dingers, and you’re on a mission to "purify" a dystopian world of evil ghosts. Without much explanation, a nightmarish cat called The Judge speaks to you in a philosopher's tone to ponder how your decisions will be accounted for. Aside from one specific moment, there aren't choices to make, but it's interesting context for a story that reveals itself through the actions you <em>have to</em> take. I, as the player, felt increasingly uneasy about where things were going – but to The Batter, it's just another plate appearance. That contrast is still quite effective, and OFF makes this distinction clear in its breaking of the fourth wall from the very start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fairly short game, taking about seven-to-eight hours to finish and defeat the secret bosses, including a few new ones. The world is made up of five zones, some of which represent industrial production where workers are ground to the bone by authoritarian figures. Liquid plastic makes up its seas, meat and metal are harvested ad nauseum, and the sugar mines bring about the worst parts of its society. A few dialogue sequences use obscure sketches like they're out of an old textbook and items you inspect in the environment feed into its cryptic worldbuilding. More often, however, it's the unconventional way characters talk to you and accept their meager existences, which grows more disturbing as you see the consequences of your mission.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">OFF Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration is met with basic puzzles that often require you to pay closer attention to the clues embedded in the environment, playing into slightly bizarre changes in the world – door codes hidden in seemingly nonsensical texts, numbers scribbled on the wall guiding you in switch-hitting puzzles, or navigating sets of rooms that break conventional logic. I wouldn’t call these things particularly engaging, but it's the surrealist subtext tucked within them that adds to its uncanny nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of random battles and NPCs patrolling the overworld make up encounters, and this is one aspect of OFF that hasn't really held up: its primitive turn-based combat system. The Batter and the floating circles called Add-Ons, which are very nondescript party members you gather throughout the story, each have a basic attack and special attacks with turns running on an ATB-style system. While The Batter is the heavy hitter, Add-Ons provide more of a support role. Other than prioritizing certain targets and accounting for a few elemental affinities, there isn't much depth or strategic nuance to combat, which becomes a tired exercise outside of a few challenging secret bosses. OFF isn't really about its combat as it's more of a vehicle for everything else it does, but it’s a shortcoming nonetheless.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You don't have to love OFF, but you damn well better respect it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF doesn't necessarily tell a complex story with tons of layers to peel away, nor is it a straightforward one where everything is spelled out for you. It doesn't try to be too clever, yet leaves room for interpretation where all roads lead to a… well, really sad story. For all its accomplishments as a uniquely disturbing experience, something beyond that still sticks with me – it's a strange kind of emotional resonance because of how blunt and unapologetic it is, increasingly off-putting especially with what it ultimately asks you to do. And with each bizarre twist along the way is a unique artistic vision that makes for a memorable experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few things that have changed in this remaster, one of the biggest being the soundtrack, which is somewhat polarizing to those familiar with the original such as myself. In light of not being able to bring the original composer back on board, this version of OFF features new songs that try to capture the unsettling, industrial, and discordant sound it once had. It largely succeeds, even if I do miss the specific low-tech flavor of the original. In a full circle moment for both parties, Toby Fox (of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">Undertale</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">Deltarune</a> fame) contributed to a few tracks, lending his sound in small ways, which was nice to hear. This isn't a soundtrack you're going to bob your head to or throw onto a playlist to evoke memories of a whimsical experience, but it's an important part of OFF's identity. It's one that complements the ghastly barks of its characters and faint ambient sounds that feed into its discomforting vibe.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Indie Games</h3><p>These are my personal favorites. Don't hate, appreciate.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate OFF as a relic of the old gaming forums where it gained traction and tumblr blogs that harnessed dedicated fandoms, and as a product of a certain era of the internet I look back on quite fondly. Discovering the original felt like unearthing a gem you wouldn't find anywhere else, shaping my taste in horror and helping identify what it is that activates that part of my brain, alongside other RPG Maker hits like Yume Nikki. Evidently, it resonated with others, having paved the way for games like Omori and being a stated inspiration for all-timer Undertale. Replaying OFF was like dusting off the blueprints of some of my favorite games, fascinating to revisit and one you have to put some respect on in spite of the ways it aged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming hot off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">Deltarune's latest chapters</a> and having been deeply moved by the series so far here in 2025, I have a certain fondness for its progenitors and I can't help but see how OFF's influence persists to this day. Indie games that delve into morality, break the fourth-wall, and subvert expectations have grown and evolved in the years since, meaning OFF doesn’t come across quite as deep as it once did in retrospect. But it is foundational material for the indie RPG scene, and this is a good excuse to play it all these years later regardless of your history.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">OFF is an important relic of the old RPG Maker scene, a pioneer in the realm of independent, small-scale RPGs that innovated in its own right. To have an accessible, modernized version that is a nearly 1-to-1 rerelease, without having to dig up old download links for a fan-translated version, is a win in itself. As a faithful remaster of a 2008 RPG Maker game, however, it also shows its age rather clearly, with a shallow turn-based combat system and barebones structure – such is the thing with aging. But even within those limitations, some things do age gracefully; the eerie atmosphere, off-kilter art style, cartoonish humor that feeds into a uniquely disturbing style of horror, and the breaking of convention that still sends chills down my spine. OFF walked so others could run – so, you don't have to love OFF, but you damn well better respect it.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/off-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-%E2%80%93-battle-system-first-impressions.1271163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">This week is the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, and with it, the first playable demo of Pokémon Legends: Z-A. I had the chance to play two different ten-minute segments of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and though I’m still left with a <em>lot</em> of questions, I did play just enough to develop some first impressions about the mechanic I’m the most curious about: its battle system.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, a quick aside, to answer a big question many of you no doubt have: I played the Pokémon Legends: Z-A demo on a Nintendo Switch 2, and it ran well and looked moderately better than the new Switch 2 versions of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. Of course, this is just a demo, and thus I didn’t get to experiment with draw distance or put it to the test with dozens of wild Pokémon on screen. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the demo: one portion of my play session was set in the early-game of only the fourth main mission: Battling in the Z-A Royale. Here, I entered a Battle Zone marked by a red area on the map, where I needed to earn enough ticket points in trainer battles to get a Challenger’s Ticket, which is needed to take part in a Promotion Match. Winning that Promotion Match for the Z-A Royale would upgrade my rank from Z to Y. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If a trainer attacks you when you aren’t looking, that means the opponent’s Pokémon gets that free first attack on your Pokémon, which is also a guaranteed critical hit.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We already knew about this core gameplay loop, which I assume we’ll be taking part in repeatedly until we reach Rank A and earn the vague prize of a single wish. It’s an entertaining enough system, where, at night, you roam the streets of a predetermined area to face other starry-eyed trainers. In expected Pokémon fashion, as soon as a trainer sees you, the battle is on–but in Legends: Z-A, if a trainer <em>attacks </em>you when you aren’t looking, that means the opponent’s Pokémon gets that free first attack on your Pokémon, which is <em>also </em>a guaranteed critical hit. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I find this to be an incredibly rude tactic that goes against the friendly competitive spirit of Pokémon, but of course, I took advantage of it myself when one of my stylish teammates, Lida, suggested I try it out. The tight corners of city streets mean it’s easy to get surprised, but it also offers opportunities for you to crouch and sneak in close to a target yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle begins seamlessly, just like in Legends: Arceus, but Legends: Z-A does away with Legends: Arceus’ slightly modified version of the core turn-based battle mechanics we’re all most familiar with. Instead, Z-A is full real-time action. At least, that’s how it presents itself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To attack, you essentially use Z-Targeting by holding the ZL button and then pressing the face buttons to instruct your Pokémon which move to use. This is the same whether you’re in battle, initiating a battle, or instructing your Pokémon to attack an obstacle–like some rocks I saw at the beginning of the mission that none of my Pokémon were strong enough to break. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, each Pokémon can know four moves at a time, and those are the moves you have access to on the four face buttons. Surprisingly, the moves don’t seem to have PP (Power Points), meaning that they can be used an unlimited number of times, with consideration to their cooldown, a new mechanic for Pokémon commonly used for skill-based action games. Different moves have different cooldown times, but the moves I had access to this early in the game all had relatively short cooldowns (around six or seven seconds) and short “casting” times as well that aren’t communicated in any menus.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of these limitations, I was pretty much always able to attack with another move as soon as my Pokémon was done attacking with the first. The moves will “fill up” with color as the cool-down counts down, indicating when you can attack with it again, but I do wish that feedback was more clearly communicated. I ended up just using almost all of the moves available in rotation pretty mindlessly. You can’t instruct your Pokémon to dodge or perform any other maneuvers besides those four attacks, though Pokémon can miss attacks if the opponent is too far from the attack’s range. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle actions appear on the right side of the screen, informing you of things like attacks performed, debuffs, and critical hits. The feedback for missing attacks, however, seemed to be nonexistent, so I can see learning <em>when</em> the best time to attack could be a bit difficult. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In trainer battles, you can’t be damaged or take the hit for your Pokémon (I tried. Mareep still fainted.) But you <em>can</em> get hurt in battles against wild Pokémon and the more dangerous Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, the other core gameplay plot device in Legends: Z-A. (And you still can’t take a hit for your Pokémon, at least it seemed to be that way.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second part of the demo pit me against a Rogue Mega-Evolved Absol after following the dog-like Zygarde 10% forme to it as part of another early-game mission, this time, the ninth. Somehow, the small-ish Zygarde carries you up to the roof where the Absol is, but apparently your character closes their eyes while this happens as the screen fades out and suddenly you’re on the roof.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, this early in the game, you don’t have the ability to Mega Evolve a Pokémon on your own, so the mysterious AZ lends you a Mega Ring, a Lucario, and the Lucarionite Mega Stone so you can face the Rogue Mega Absol without getting your butt categorically handed to you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this battle, you must dodge to avoid the opponent’s attacks, as Absol <em>is </em>coming for you–not just your Pokémon. I found it a bit cumbersome to balance attacking and avoiding enemy attacks, as you can attack only while you’re locked onto a target with ZL, but you can’t dash or dodge while targeting. I’m sure this is something I’d develop better muscle memory for as I play more, but it felt odd to have my actions restricted like that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a secondary goal to pay attention to when up against Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon: you must collect Mega Power orbs to build up enough energy to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, and keep collecting them so your Pokémon doesn’t de-Mega Evolve. Attacking the Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon forces the Mega Power orbs out of them, which you then must pick up yourself. It’s a pretty clever way to force you to put yourself in danger and use the dodge mechanics. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This fight was much more interesting than the trainer battles, as is expected considering all the extra things I needed to worry about besides pressing the attack buttons. Another thing I noticed is that, although you can’t tell your Pokémon to dodge, they <em>will</em> default to returning to your side when you’re not locked on to an opponent. So if <em>you </em>start avoiding the enemy’s AOE (area of effect) attacks, your Pokémon will too, as long as you give them enough time to retreat. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I do hope Legends: Z-A gets challenging enough to make me more intentionally dish out commands and think about switching Pokémon at just the right moment. I can see the potential, but with just twenty minutes of experiencing the early game, it’s much too soon to tell if this real-time battle system will scratch the strategy-itch Pokémon games usually do for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some last-minute housekeeping, as I did briefly explore the menus: Pokémon have the common six-stat spread, no abilities (just like in Legends: Arceus), but <em>do</em> have Natures that affect their stats (<em>unlike</em> in Legends: Arceus). I also found a shop that sells Mints to change these Natures while I played through the ninth story mission.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said before, I have a lot of questions and I’m <em>very</em> keen to play more Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but for now, we’ll have to wait until it’s out on October 16 to know more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor of guides at IGN and has been catching Pok</em>é<em>mon since Red and Blue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> publisher EA is making "changes" to Rush mode to "better balance" the gameplay between attacking and defending players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes arrive just as fans step into Battlefield 6's Open Beta Weekend 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-confirms-playlist-changes-custom-search-and-start-time-for-open-beta-weekend-2"><u>which is live now (August 15) and will run until Sunday, August 17</u></a>. The All-Out Warfare playlist includes Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush… and it's the latter that doesn't seem to be going down all that well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who've yet to play, Rush tasks players with destroying military communications — better known as MCOMs. You can either do this with a heavy explosive assault or by placing a bomb. It's placing a bomb, however, that has been causing problems: with a lengthy 45 seconds between placement and detonating, the timer was too long and giving one side an unfair advantage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer DICE is already on the case, though. In a post on social media, the team <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed</u></a> "we've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team said it would "continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments," which is just as well, as the timer is not the only problem upsetting players right now. Others have criticized the spacing between MCOM objectives and spawn points, making for some unpleasant spawn traps on maps like Iberian, Empire, and Siege of Cairo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the Rush game mode should be disabled in Battlefield 6 until it's been properly worked on," <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> one unhappy player. "Every map has insane balance problems, ZERO space between sectors/MCOM locations and even 12v12 feels like an utter clusterf**k. Such a shame. Rush used to be great." The post has secured over 3,000 likes at the time of writing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement"><u>EA issued a statement acknowledging the cheating occurring in Battlefield 6, and highlighting its efforts to combat it</u></a> on top of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next"><u>requirement for players to enable Secure Boot in their BIOS</u></a>. In the post, the publisher said its existing tech has already prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hardspace: Shipbreaker - PC Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> addressed to its community, the developer shared that an agreement had been reached with its former publishing partner to reacquire full ownership of the Hardspace IP.</p><p dir="ltr">"As our studio begins this exciting new chapter, Hardspace is going to become a core part of our business strategy going forward," stated Blackbird Interactive's comms director Steven Messner, confirming that multiple Hardspace projects are currently in development, which suggests that there may be games spanning different genres within the game's universe rather than just a sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">For players who own Hardspace: Shipbreaker, the new ownership will also be reflected through a small update, including updated splash screens, logos, and privacy policies around the collection and use of private data.</p><p dir="ltr">While it is confirmed that Focus Entertainment will no longer be affiliated with Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Messner added, "Let's not mince words, Hardspace: Shipbreaker wouldn't be what it is today without [Focus Entertainment]. We're eternally grateful for their partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the Hardspace IP."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement also coincides with the pre-registration for the <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" rel="nofollow ">LYNX Pioneer Program</a>, where the Hardspace community can sign up for the chance to access exclusive early playtests of future Hardspace projects (and other original IP from Blackbird Interactive), behind-the-scenes development updates, and more.</p>

                <p>Grinding Gear Games has released an announcement teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2's</a> next content update, The Third Edict, confirming just when you'll be able to play it. There's not much to go off in the trailer, showing the inside of a large, cylindrical tower covered in runes as a figure appears to be performing some kind of ritual. A voiceover also ominously describes the need for some kind of weapon, saying, "This weapon is our only chance to save humanity. We must invoke The Third Edict."</p><p dir="ltr">According to a Steam post announcing the new update, it will be available 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 9 PM BST on August 29. Ahead of that, next week there will be a livestream taking place also at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 9 PM BST on August 20 that promises to properly reveal The Third Edict.</p>

            <p>Crimson Desert, Pearl Abyss' visually impressive action game, will be at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in Cologne next week, but if you aren't going you can see how it's shaping up in this new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>In the 13-minute video you get a solid slice of action and exploration, plus a look at the rather splendid visuals. From large-scale fights to boss battles, you'll get a little taste of what Crimson Desert will be offering.</p>
<p>The gameplay jumps in following the protagonist being ambushed by the Drunken Black Bears.</p>

<blockquote><p>FEATURES</p>
<p><strong>Large-Scale Warfare Setting </strong></p>
<p>The video immerses viewers in epic-scale warfare, with countless NPCs battling in real time across every corner of the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Missions</strong></p>
<p>Kliff undertakes a variety of battlefield missions, from firing cannons to destroying enemy watchtowers and aiding allies in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Traversal Methods </strong></p>
<p>Kliff can call and ride his horse to increase mobility and use the "Crow's Wing" ability to glide across the air in the most efficient route. His skill "Axiom Force" also allows him to not only travel with more maneuverability but to execute strategic maneuvers in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<p>As Kliff advances through missions and the questline, he faces a wide range of combat scenarios, each offering multiple strategies that allow players to adapt and showcase their own combat style. Kliff can strategically use not only his wide array of offensive abilities but also execute well-timed dodges and blocks to gain advantages and switch between multiple weapons.</p>
<p>Kliff's "Axiom Bracelet" enhances attacks with elements of fire, lightning, and ice, with each attribute resulting in different effects on the enemies.</p>
<p>Kliff also uses "Artillery Whistling Arrows" — an arrow that calls in allied forces to take fire on a designated location.</p>
<p><strong>Graphics </strong></p>
<p>Behind the battlefield, magnificent natural environments and terrains, such as rock cliffs and mountain ranges unfold in the background, witnessing the realistic graphics implemented through Pearl Abyss' proprietary "BlackSpace Engine."</p></blockquote>
<p>Crimson Desert was set to release at the end of this year, but recently got pushed into a Q1 2026 release window. We might get more details at Gamescom next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mafia: The Old Country arrived on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC a week ago at the time of this writing, and according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">new report from data firm Sensor Tower</a>, Hangar 13's latest entry in the series has sold more than <strong>800K copies</strong> in its first week.</p>



<p>That figure is across all platforms, but according to Sensor Tower, 48% of those copies were sold on PlayStation. </p>



<p>"<em>The robust early sales underline the enduring appeal of the Mafia IP and validate the studio’s choice to deliver a linear, narrative-driven experience with cinematic presentation</em>," writes Sensor Tower on LinkedIn.</p>



<p>"<em>The stronger performance on PlayStation may reflect the platform’s strategic alignment with story-focused single-player games.</em>"</p>



<p>Some other first-week stats shared by Hangar 13 show that players have already "<em>dispatched</em>" more than 185 million in-game enemies, and fired over 600 million shots.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>It's all together a good start for the game, though we'll see if 2K and Hangar 13 will be able to keep up the momentum going forward. The studio is already working to add requested features from players, as Hangar 13 also confirmed that the ability to 'Free Ride' in the map is on its way, along with "<em>new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Mafia: The Old Country for us, </a>and enjoyed his time with it, despite not being able to explore the Sicilian countryside as much as he would have liked, writing in his review, "<em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>Wuyang</span></a><span>, the 44th hero in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s roster</span></a><span>, isn’t officially in the game yet, but he’s already showing a lot of potential. The water-wielding Support character is playable for the next few days as part of a trial period, and after just one day with the hero, players are coming up with some diabolical combos. I played around with him a bit, and I don’t think he’s my style of Support hero because his low healing output makes him feel a bit too passive for my liking. Despite this, I can see how a skillful player could make the most of his kit by setting up devastating opportunities for teammates. Wuyang feels evocative of the approach to Support hero design from when the first game launched, which was less about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-best-healer-gay-character-support-role-1850071120"><span>healing as the be-all, end-all utility</span></a><span> and more about, well, supporting other players to do their thing. As such, his ultimate, Tidal Blast, isn’t a big defensive ultimate that outheals incoming waves of damage. Instead, it’s one of the game’s new best set-up abilities.</span></p> <p><span>Tidal Blast has two major functions. First, it creates a water-based barrier around either Wuyang himself or an ally. This gives the target a bulky chunk of overhealth that will keep them safe from most incoming attacks. The second thing it does is detonate after a few seconds, doing a little bit of damage to enemies within its radius. However, it also knocks enemies to the ground, similar to Reinhardt’s Earthshatter ultimate, in a circular radius. This will give you a precious few seconds to follow up and do some real damage to an enemy team while they’re on the ground. On its own, this is a really solid ability that can take down enemy defenses and give you a window to wreck shop. However, with coordination, it can also be absolutely devastating when paired with characters like Tracer, Junker Queen, and Sombra, who can quickly dive into an enemy backline.</span></p>   <p><span>Coordination will be key in making these combos work. Timing is everything with Tidal Blast, because if your target is seconds early or late into a play, the whole setup can fall apart. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>players like KarQ have demonstrated a few uses for the ability, like shielding Junker Queen as she heads in with her own ultimate which has her dash forward and inflict Wound damage on enemies, potentially cutting off a group of opponents at the knees and&nbsp; leaving them open for a quick finish. Some characters don’t even need to be dashing into the backline to get value out of Tidal Blast. Orisa’s ultimate, which sucks enemies into her position before bringing down a powerful charged strike onto the area around her, can be risky because it’s somewhat easy to move out of its range if you have a mobility skill. If she goes in covered in a water bubble, however, she can bring enemies into range, then Tidal Blast will knock them down for her to finish them off. It requires precise timing, but there’s potential, when two well-coordinated players are working together, to wipe out several enemies and clear a path to an objective.</span></p> <p><span>Wuyang is playable until August 18, and officially joins the roster on August 26.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An insider has claimed that there are three playable characters in Resident Evil Requiem; however, we have only seen one in action till now. </p>



<p>Ahead of the new gameplay trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Resident Evil Requiem has been receiving a series of leaks daily. Recently, we learned that the upcoming game will feature ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us</a>‘ combat and vehicles. We also learned other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story details</a> about RE9. Now, the latest leak says there are more playable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-will-reportedly-have-alyssa-as-a-playable-character-for-a-bit">Resident Evil Requiem Will Reportedly Have Alyssa as a Playable Character for a Bit</h2>



<p>The new leak about Resident Evil Requiem’s playable comes from none other than AestheticGame (Dusk Golem) on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his previous posts, he stated that many diehard fans would feel that RE9 is “oddly like the Revelations games.” To which a fan asked whether the upcoming game will have four playable characters like Revelations did. Dusk Golem replied that players will be able to step into the shoes of Leon and Grace, and “a little Alyssa.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon &amp; Grace. A little Alyssa, but that's really it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>As of now, players have only seen Grace Ashcroft as the playable character in Resident Evil Requiem, and we have yet to learn about any new ones. Dusk Golem has claimed and reiterated several times that Leon will be one of the main protagonists in the game, but Alyssa is a new name. For those who don’t know, Alyssa Ashcroft is Grace’s mother and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> also the giant woman monster following her in the trailer. </p>



<p>As always, this information doesn’t come from an official source, so readers should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, the next Resident Evil remakes are expected to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive in 2027/2028</a>.&nbsp;Also, the upcoming Resident Evil movie by Zach Cregger will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“. What are your thoughts on Resident Evil Requiem having three playable characters?

According to French website <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch on November 14. If that date is accurate, then Black Ops 7 will be launching during a relaxed window in the gaming calendar, as November is a fairly light month--for now--when it comes to new releases.</p><p>This is par for the course with Call of Duty, as it typically launches between mid-October and mid-November each year.

<p>Dealabs also reports that Black Ops 7 will not be available for Switch 2 when it launches and it "remains uncertain" if Activision will port the game to the new Nintendo console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">despite Microsoft committing to bring the series to Nintendo hardware</a>. The game will also reportedly have a physical launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p><p>What we do know is that a "worldwide reveal" for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">will take place during Gamescom Opening Night on August 19</a>, so a release date confirmation could be likely here.</p><p>Developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, this is the first time that Activision has ever released Black Ops games in back-to-back years, and the developers claim that this will be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">"most mind-bending" entry in the Call of Duty series yet</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Crimson Desert developer and publisher Pearl Abyss has debuted a new 13-minute gameplay video showcasing a snippet of what Gamescom 2025 attendees will get a chance to play in the coming week.</p>



<p>The action-adventure game was delayed just days prior to this new gameplay drop, pushing the game into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">first quarter of Pearl Abyss' FY2026</a>. It's the game's second major delay, as it was initially meant to arrive <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">sometime earlier this year</a> after a demo showcase at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and then when that didn't happen, it was supposed to release sometime in fall 2025.</p>



<p>Now, of course, we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on it unless you'll be at Gamescom 2025, where you'll get to play the sections featured in this video and a bit more.</p>



<p>This gameplay showcase features a look at a few moments of narrative and exploration, but the highlight of the video is the extended look at combat, including a boss fight towards the back-half of the video.</p>



<p>At this point in the game's story, Crimson Desert's protagonist, Greymane Kliff, and his companions are ambushed, narrowly surviving the attack before Kliff has to take on the boss you'll see in the video, Cassius Morten.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Crimson Desert was first revealed all the way back in 2019, and with its release now set for sometime next year, it'll potentially be seven years from its reveal to its release. </p>



<p>At least it appears to be worth the wait, if the final gameplay experience is as polished as these gameplay videos make it seem. Hopefully, we'll have a proper release date to look forward to soon.</p>

              <p>Super-realistic revenge shooter <em>Better Than Dead</em> has just been announced, along with an intensely violent trailer. The brutal game, in which you play as a Chinese woman who has escaped from slavery and is now exacting revenge on the photo-realistic streets of Hong Kong, is all depicted as if from bodycam footage. And—wow—even the trailer is tough viewing. It looks amazing and terrifyingly real, and I suspect this could become gaming’s next big controversy.</p> <p>With each new graphical generation over the last 30 years, the FPS genre transformed from the cartoonish arcade styles of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> to the ultra-realistic visceral depictions of, well, <em>Doom</em>. Along the way, as fidelity improved, the FPS always courted controversy, with mainstream attention grabbed on the advent of games like 1999’s <em>Kingpin: Life of Crime</em>, 2000’s&nbsp;<em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, and any number of&nbsp;<em>Call</em>s<em> of Duty</em>. However, the genre has been so damned impressive-looking for so long now, it feels like the corners have rubbed down on the reactions. Attempts at moral panics have more recently focused on subject matter over looks, as we’ve all become inured to hyper-realistically shooting the kneecaps off our enemies. But I wonder whether&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> might trigger a new wave of concern.</p> <p>As a games critic who’s been around for the entire evolution of the genre, I think I’m pretty acclimatized to the whole shebang, and have read enough well-researched studies over the years to know that there’s never been a proven significant link between video-game violence and real-world violence. Which is my needlessly pompous way of saying: I love a good violent game! Gib me up any time. So it really took me back when I had such a visceral reaction to the trailer for <em>Better Than Dead</em>. It’s not because of the gun violence, or the blood splatters, or even that the protagonist’s targets are often running in fear (although it was that a bit); it’s that it’s all depicted as the most extraordinarily realistic bodycam footage.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Better Than Dead - MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqXZ1gPmU2E?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Real-world violence is something I go out of my way to avoid seeing, and when bodycam footage is released of police brutality and unlawful killings, I’ll desperately try to avoid seeing it. Like most people, I’m very able to separate fantasy and reality, and can enjoy blowing the brains out of perfectly rendered aliens at the same time as being horrified by seeing a living human in pain. But when video game brutality is depicted in such a specific format, complete with the curving of the fish-eye lens and those grainy textures typical of low-grade video recordings, that line for me is incredibly blurred.</p> <p>As a result, the footage of&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> incessantly swam down the uncanny valley, at times looking completely photo-realistic, and others clearly being video game graphics. What disturbed me more than anything else was not the blood from gunshots—that was cartoonish if anything—but the <em>walls</em>. I know that sounds silly, but there’s something about how utterly lifelike they were, the way the surface textures speckled with artifacts just like when you see real bodycam footage. They become the most incredibly convincing aspect of the trailer, selling the perspective such that everything else feels so much more real.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617987">© Ubisoft / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>The slightly silly perspective from which FPS games have always been viewed gives off the feeling that you’re a head with a gun jutting out just below your chin. Yes, some let you look down and see your feet, but it’s always felt far more like you’re playing a floating camera than a person. But a bodycam—that makes sense of the whole format. That <em>is</em> a floating camera, and suddenly the genre is given a pragmatic reality that I’ve found incredibly jarring.</p>

 <p>Then, added to this view, is the fisheye lens and faux-low-grade footage. It’s really interesting how incredibly effective this is every time the game shows something set outside, and how bizarrely crap it appears when indoors. That’s largely due to how awful the textures are in the office interior where a weird amount of the footage is set—those drink bottles and monitors look like something from the early 2000s, so jarringly different from the moments when it cuts to exterior action and then, good god, it looks like real life. The pixelating of faces, however, works both indoors and out, because oh my goodness that’s chilling. It all adds to the sense of this being genuine footage, recovered and edited.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617986">© MicroProse / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, were this idea being used for a game about, I dunno, saving people from danger, it would offer that same down-to-earth naturalism, but perhaps not be quite so disturbing.&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> is a game about a young woman who has escaped from cruel slavery exacting her murderous revenge on every single person involved—and from the footage, presumably everyone else nearby as well. According to the press release announcing the game, “In <em>Better Than Dead</em>, you’re not just surviving—you’re retaliating. Once held captive and humiliated on film by those who broke her, the protagonist now turns the camera on them. One by one, they’ll fall. Every mission is a ruthless, high-stakes raid through the underbelly of Hong Kong. No remorse. No hesitation. Only vengeance.”</p>

 <p>The game cites “gritty Hong Kong action cinema of the ’80s and ’90s” as its inspiration, although it’s hard not to think of Park Chan-wook’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_Trilogy">Vengeance Trilogy</a> when it comes to people released from unfair captivity and seeking brutal revenge on their captors. And those films didn’t exactly land without their share of controversy.</p> <p>Now, there’s a decent chance the game will be no good. This is being published by one-time PC gaming powerhouse MicroProse, the biggest surprise there being that MicroProse is still a thing. (In fact, I looked it up and it seems to be back in the hands of at least one of the original early-’80s founders.) Even more strange is that behind <em>Better Than Dead</em> is a solo developer who has previously only released a super-cute vertical FPS called (somehow)&nbsp;<em>Forza Polpo!</em>, and a demo for a chibi cartoon-like non-violent platformer called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2600000/Mountain_Boy/"><em>Mountain Boy</em></a>. This is, er, something of a shift.</p> <p>But of course, it’s not whether a game’s good or not that riles the pearl-clutching press who love to pretend to be horrified that games are training your kids for their next high school shooting. And yes, when this is eventually released (there’s no date yet), it could come and go with no one noticing—these things often do. But what remains so interesting to me, as an inoculated player of violent games for 40 years, is how it made me sit back in shock. I can’t think of a trailer that’s done that in years, perhaps even not since <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>‘s deeply unpleasant depictions of violence 25 years ago seemed to shock the whole games industry into backing off and focusing on excitement instead of brutality for a good few years after.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have already made changes to the Rush mode, which was introduced during the second Open Beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s Open Beta weekend 2 is now live, and it has instantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-huge-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in a vast number of players</a>. Many players must be looking forward to the weekend, as they will have two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new modes and a new map</a> to try out. However, one of the modes released this weekend, Rush, has already received a fix from BF6 developers. </p>







<p>The latest post from Battlefield Comms on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states that new balancing changes have been made to Breakthrough and Rush. The defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush have been fixed to 12 seconds; previously, they were set within the 6-12 second range. Also, in Breakthrough, fewer players are needed to capture an objective. </p>

<p>A couple of hours ago, the Battlefield Comms account posted another update for Battlefield 6’s Rush mode. The Rush mode’s MCOM timer was reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to improve the balance between attacking and defending players. The developers will continue to monitor the game mode and make further balancing adjustments as needed. </p>

<p>Since open beta weekend 2 began, several players have raised concerns about Battlefield 6’s Rush Mode. Popular Battlefield content creator, Westie, has been voicing their opinions about BF6’s Rush mode on <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. According to them, there are massive balancing problems across each map, and there is no space between MCOM locations. Players on the r/Battlefield subreddit also have issues with the game mode being locked to 12v12 games. </p>



<p>The new timer changes do help, but players are asking for more balancing improvements for BF6’s Rush mode, including adding “<a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1956262080064921803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sufficient space</a>“, among other things. However, players should keep in mind that Battlefield 6 is still in beta, and the beta was intended to identify problems like these, which could be addressed before the full launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield and Call of Duty ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-and-call-of-duty-complement-each-other-says-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complement each other</a>‘, according to BF6 developers. Additionally, many Battlefield 6 players have experienced issues with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA</a>.

    <p><span>A look at what attendees can expect on the show floor.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Pearl Abyss [36 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pearl-abyss">Pearl Abyss</a> has released a 13-minute gameplay demonstration video for <em><a title="Games > Crimson Desert [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a></em> ahead of Gamescom 2025, showcasing a first look at what attendees can expect to play on the show floor from August 20 to 24 in Cologne, Germany. The same demo will also be playable at PAX West 2025 from August 29 to September 1 in Seattle, Washington. <span id="more-984607"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Before this point in the story, the protagonist—the Greymane Kliff—and his fellow Greymane members are caught in an ambush orchestrated by their enemies, the Drunken Black Bears. After a fierce battle, Kliff and his comrades are separated and scattered. Kliff embarks on a search for his companions, and during his journey in the continent of Pywel, Kliff hears news that the Greymane Oongka—one of his most trusted companions–is in the region of Calphade.</p><p>Kliff arrives in Calphade only to find out that his efforts to reach Oongka is complicated by the rupture of a violent rebellion instigated by Cassius Morten—a subordinate of Marquis Stefan Lanford, lord of Calphade and an ally to the Greymanes—who has joined forces with the Black Bears to overthrow Lanford. Calphade is on the brink of defeat.</p><p>Kliff joins the battle, defeats both the rebellion and Black Bear forces, and is able to shift the advantage back to Calphade’s forces. On the battlefield, Kliff reunites with Oongka, who has been fighting off the rebels on the side of Lanford, and defeats Cassius Morten, ending the revolt in Calphade.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Large-Scale Warfare Setting</strong> – The video immerses viewers in epic-scale warfare, with countless NPCs battling in real time across every corner of the battlefield. As the Calphadean army and rebel forces clash with fierce intensity, artillery flies overhead and dynamic, high-tension combat unfolds on all sides. The shouts of soldiers, the clashing of swords, and the smoke and flames enveloping the field all come together to evoke the feeling of a real war zone.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Kliff undertakes a variety of battlefield missions, from firing cannons to destroying enemy watchtowers and aiding allies in trouble.</li><li><strong>Traversal Methods</strong> – Kliff can call and ride his horse to increase mobility and use the “Crow’s Wing” ability to glide across the air in the most efficient route. His skill “Axiom Force” also allows him to not only travel with more maneuverability but to execute strategic mane uvers in combat.</li><li><strong>Combat</strong><ul><li>As Kliff advances through missions and the questline, he faces a wide range of combat scenarios, each offering multiple strategies that allow players to adapt and showcase their own combat style. Kliff can strategically use not only his wide array of offensive abilities but also execute well-timed dodges and blocks to gain advantages, and switch between multiple weapons.</li><li>Kliff’s “Axiom Bracelet” enhances attacks with elements of fire, lightning, and ice, with each attribute resulting in different effects on the enemies. For example, arrows with fire enhancement explode on impact, while an ice-enhanced sword attack can freeze enemies, where they then can be shattered with a follow up blow.</li><li>Kliff also uses “Artillery Whistling Arrows”—an arrow that calls in allied forces to take fire on a designated location. Beyond simply defeating enemies, it can also be used strategically to take down enemy structure, such as watchtowers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boss Fights</strong><ul><li>Midway through the questline, Kliff face off against a formidable Black Bear opponent, a massive foe whose sheer size and strength set it apart from regular soldiers. Due to his size, grappling skills are ineffective, and he unleashes a range of devastating attacks, including powerful axe swings and moves that launch players into the air.</li><li>The war concludes in a boss battle against Cassius Morton, a formidable boss who wields a mace and shield with deadly precision. While evading his relentless strikes, Cassius can be defeated in multiple ways, including ordinary attacks.</li><li>Players can also choose a special tactic to bring Cassius down. Steadily dealing damage will push him into a staggered stage, where then Kliff can use a special skill to lift the pillars that have broken around him as a result of their battle and wield it as a weapon, delivering massive damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Graphics</strong> – The continent of Pywel that can be seen in the video provides another source of enjoyment. The explorable continent, which is rendered with high-quality graphics, and vividly experience various natural phenomena such as natural lighting and weather that changes over time. Behind the battlefield, magnificent natural environments and terrains, such as rock cliffs and mountain ranges unfold in the background, witnessing the realistic graphics implemented through Pearl Abyss’ proprietary “BlackSpace Engine.”</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Crimson Desert</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,117 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,691 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,918 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Q1 2026.</p><p>Watch the footage below.</p><h2><span>Gamescom 2025 Gameplay</span></h2><p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - 13 Minutes of Gamescom 2025 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKollpGYGrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-13-minutes-of-gamescom-2025-gameplay]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> keeps things focused with its recreation of 1900s Sicily, but for fans looking to break free from the linear nature of its design, a new Free Ride mode will be added to the game in the coming months. This will be a free update, and <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1956025890632077319" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer Hangar 13 says</a> it will add "new activities" and gameplay content. More details on it will be shared at a later date.</p><p>This will likely be similar to the Free Ride mode found in Mafia: Definitive Edition, which gave players more activities to pursue within that game's open-world structure. Mafia: The Old Country does offer a free-roam mode that can be accessed via the Chapter Replay menu, but when compared to the bustling levels of the main story campaign, the world does feel empty in comparison. It is worth checking out if you're a completionist, as you can hunt down collectibles and fully upgrade Enzo's arsenal along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mafia: The Old Country Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Hangar 13 shared a few more details on the game, as it says that in its first week, more than 600 million shots have been fired, 185 enemies have been taken down, 17 million bandages have been used to patch Enzo up, and players have "earned" a total of 10 billion Dinari from their sessions. And they say that (video game) crime doesn't pay.</p><p>One of the big new games for August, Mafia: The Old Country has received fairly positive reviews. Critics have highlighted its gorgeous recreation of Italy and excellent performances, while also noting that its gameplay systems can feel archaic at times.</p><p>"Mafia: The Old Country is at its best when things slow down, letting you take in all the sights and sounds of Sicily. Like previous Mafia games, it nails the look and feel of its real-world counterpart by investing heavily in the details. Unfortunately, generic gameplay and dated mission design hold Mafia: The Old Country back, making it feel like a relic of the early 2010s," Jake Dekker wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/">GameSpot's review</a>.</p>

                <p>Although handhelds are getting more powerful chips, they still lag behind the hardware that can be found in desktop and laptop PCs. However, one modder has created their own handheld system based on high-end laptop hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">Billibilli creator Qingchen DIY (via <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-builds-12-5-inch-4k-gaming-handheld-powered-by-nvidia-rtx-4090-laptop-gpu" rel="nofollow ">Videocardz</a>) has a built a portable device that has a huge 12.5-inch 4K IPS display panel. In their video, the custom handheld is shown to be running on Windows 11, while the system settings shows that it contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU as well as an Intel Core i9-149000HX CPU. It also contains 64GB of DDR5-5600 memory and 2TB of storage.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>It appears that this was a laptop that has been converted into a gaming handheld, with a light green shell containing the usual thumbsticks and face buttons, as well as a number of ports and a cooling vent at the top.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Qingchen DIY also demonstrates the system running Horizon Forbidden West, God of War, and Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, with the temperature staying at 72ºC, although it is also relying on an external power source to maintain high performance.</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to other handhelds available commercially, the largest handheld is the Acer Nitro Blaze, which has an 10.95-inch display. Most handheld chipsets also use GPUs from AMD, except for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, both of which use custom versions of Nvidia's Tegra mobile chipsets.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Switch 2's hardware lags behind PC handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-claims-the-switch-2-redefines-portable-gaming-graphics/1100-6532023/">the Switch 2 has redefined portable gaming graphics</a>.</p>

It's a notable first that organizers say will comprise the most diverse lineup in Gamescom history.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To accommodate burgeoning exhibitor interest, Gamescom 2025 is expanding its footprint to a record 233,000 square meters. Record registration numbers mean it's a smart move, with last year's event attracting 335,000 visitors.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opening Night Live, the digital and in-person show that kicks off the event with a deluge of video game announcements, has also been moved to Hall 1 for the first time. The switch means 5,000 people will be able to attend in-person—although the showcase will also be streamed online for a global audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Felix Falk, managing director of game—the German games industry association that owns the Gamescom brand and co-organizes the event with Koelnmesse—described interest in the show as "immense," but why has Gamescom flourished in the years following the pandemic when another major industry event that went by the name of E3 fell into ruin?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-18-arkane-union-brands-microsoft-an-accomplice-to-genocide-krafton-hits-back-at-unknown-worlds-founders-and-is-collective-action-the-answer-to-miscrediting-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #18: Arkane union brands Microsoft an 'accomplice' to genocide, Krafton hits back at Unknown Worlds founders, and is collective action the answer to miscrediting?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer earlier this week, Falk suggested Gamescom weathered that storm and emerged stronger because organizers understood the importance of establishing a digital footprint even before COVID-19 left the world in stasis.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opening Night Live was part of that push to attract a global audience via the power of streaming, and Falk explained that almost 50 million people watched last year's Geoff Keighly-fronted opening salvo. That's a lot of eyes on the Gamescom brand.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Falk said the pivot to a hybrid digital-meets-physical event that included online communities meant Gamescom was in "good shape" before the pandemic. But what about post-COVID? In a world where major publishers are by no means guaranteed to attend in-person events—largely because the likes of Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have all taken to saving their biggest announcements for their own digital directs—where is the value in meeting face-to-face?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gamescom organizer says face-to-face events close the 'emotional distance' between &nbsp;developers and consumers">Gamescom organizer says face-to-face events close the 'emotional distance' between &nbsp;developers and consumers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For both exhibitors and consumers, Falk suggested there is an "emotional" aspect to attending events in-person that is tough to replicate digitally."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/godforge-dev-fateless-raises-14m-through-community-driven-investments" target="_self" data-discover="true">Godforge dev Fateless raises $14M through community driven investments</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Being on-site is a totally different experience and much deeper and much more worthy for the companies and the games, compared to the digital format," he said. "You can see that if you head to the indie area, which is the biggest indie area we've ever had, and there you'll normally find the developer stood next to the game. You can talk to them—and they love the feedback. Of course, you could do a survey online and get feedback that way, but it's different from talking to each other."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, he explained that in-person events close the "emotional distance" between developers and players to create experiences that simply cannot be replicated online.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Falk described digital events as "fast" and "dynamic" by contrast, which makes them a unique proposition in their own right. So, by cultivating an online presence and letting people engage with the show virtually, Falk claimed Gamescom managed to become a "platform for the whole industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[The hybrid setup] means you do find target groups and communities you normally don't reach," he added. "You also reach media or stakeholders who wouldn't normally come to your specific showcase, because you're a part of the biggest show worldwide for gaming."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making digital inroads also allows Gamescom to expand without stretching the in-person event to a breaking point. Discussing what long-term success means for the showcase, Falk explained he doesn't believe Gamescom will live or die based on "one KPI of scale."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-indicates-paypal-has-dropped-support-for-steam-over-content-concerns" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve says PayPal support is no longer available in some regions due to content concerns</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, he said organizers have been intentionally limiting attendance in Cologne to preserve the atmosphere of the show.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We don't want the atmosphere to be worse because we squeeze in too many people," he continued. "We could squeeze more in—which we don't—because the quality of the experience is important for the fans."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, there is room for measured growth. Falk noted the record number of exhibitors was possible because there is still room to expand the show floor, but reiterated that "more" isn't the overarching plan.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have more exhibitors than ever before, which is great because we still have space to grow, but [success] is more about variety and diversity of content," he added. "It is not our aim to grow, grow, grow—because that doesn't make sense. It's more about the quality and most importantly the digital reach, which we have seen over the last few years is exponentially growing."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom is also expanding into other regions such as Latin America and Asia, but we'll have more on that particular topic next week.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate.1271043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been over a month since Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate launched and you may be wondering where our review is. The simple answer is we did not get a review code, and judging by Metacritic, no one else did either – there are just 12 reviews for the PS5 version, most for lesser known sites, and eight reviews on PC. Normally, this would not matter as I am a huge Destiny 2 fan, and so obviously I would buy the new expansion even if Bungie did not provide code for review… except that I didn’t.</p>
<p>When Bungie started flinging around terms like Metroidvania I immediately got worried, that does not sound like Destiny 2 at all. I <em>have</em> played the first mission from The Edge of Fate (and you can too, everyone gets it for free ) and I was less than impressed, so I decided that, for the first time in almost twelve years, I would skip a Destiny 2 expansion.</p>
<p>However, we do have some die-hard fans in the TSA Destiny 2 clan, so I asked them for their thoughts on The Edge of Fate and the state of the game,</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Bungie’s storytelling has improved considerably over the years, it had a bit of a wobble post The Final Shape but I think things had picked up by Heresy. So, what did you make of the new story?</em></p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Normally, I’d finish the DLC within a few days, but it’s been over a month now and I’ve still not completed it. I enjoyed what I have seen of the story so far, the budget seems a bit higher seeing as there are more cinematic cutscenes, and the use of the holograms displayed via your Ghost ‘on comms’ to diverge information and mission beats is quite cool, seems a direct progression of the hologram npc/chat mechanic that came in with the HELM. I’m unsure about how ‘contrived’ some of the story beats are written and how some of the characters directly link together in the past, even though we’ve known them for a decade and there hasn’t been a hint of that before, even with the copious amounts of lore and backstory the game drops.</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I agree with the needless ties to new backstories. I enjoyed the new elements and characters of the story – finally, a bit of freshness rather than the same old characters.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I quite liked playing through the story at the time, particularly the flashback cutscene, but to be honest, I remember very little about it now it’s done, or the relevance of the new fella.</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> The campaign itself I found a little complicated to follow. It felt a little disjointed and I was not sure if I was supposed to be doing side missions in order to make it make more sense.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I agree with Lee about the side missions – it wasn’t clear why they were there, if they had to be done in a specific order and if they related in any way to the main story.</p>

<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Rather than give you a new Super, The Edge of Fate gave Guardians powers that only worked on Kepler, the new location. Guardians could change in a ball of electricity and roll about, and also manipulate Dark Matter to rearrange objects and create new pathways.&nbsp; I found the ball to be horrendous to play and control and the exact opposite of what Destiny 2 is meant to be. I want to be a death-dealing tank that throws flaming axes, not a sparkling marble that hides in drainpipes. What did everyone else think?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jack :</strong> All of the puzzle mechanics were utterly stupid, unnecessary, and not fun.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Agreed. It is if someone suggested Metroidvania and instead of doing actually good gear gating and back tracking, they just played a Metroid game, saw you became a ball, and went with that.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> The ball mechanic was pointless and not really very enjoyable, but easy enough to get used to. But it did just feel like something they decided to chuck in just to have something different.</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> In typical Bungie fashion they drip fed the Dark Matter feature to us a bit at a time. It was rubbish until the feature was complete, then it became more fun to blitz around doing different mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> It has a steep learning curve, I think once things came together it was much more enjoyable, especially the last mission where you had access to all of the Dark Matter abilities. I enjoyed that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Kepler has one group activity, The Sieve, which occurs every 1hr 44 minutes, much less frequently than Public Events in other locations. What do you think of The Sieve?</em></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> Only played it once. Meh, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Played it because I had to, to get the gun. Nothing about it made me want to&nbsp;play&nbsp;it&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I second this.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Wait, it has a group activity? I thought it was just barren!</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> It has a baffling timed lockout system à la mobile games, which would be annoying if it was any good – but it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> It’s alright, although absurd it’s on such a sucky cooldown. It would make far more sense if it was one of the activities we should be grinding for power, based solely on the fact of it being new..</p>

<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Did anyone else feel a bit miffed that Bungie reset everyone’s progress levels, effectively wiping over ten years of progress?</em></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> No, not at all. A welcome refresh, with the ease of levelling up better&nbsp;than&nbsp;before&nbsp;too</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah, essentially just cutting a few zeroes off the level seeing as almost everyone was at 2020, since they gave out 2020 gear for free during Return of the Nine.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I was more upset about the reset of Guardian ranks – doesn’t mean much or affect the gameplay, but having just defeated the Witness after playing for 10+ years, only to be reset to the same rank as a newbie just felt cheap</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> Yeah same, I liked that it matters more now, but resetting rather than keeping it at your highest level from previous season was whack.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> Not effectively communicating that the rank of your rewards (Tier 5 Weapons etc.) was directly affected by your Guardian rank was a bit annoying.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>As Adam mentioned it, how are you finding the new weapon system and Armour 3.0?</em></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Really great. Quick and easy, and the fact that Master stuff is matchmade helps lots with that too.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> I don’t like that some of my best picks for slots are effectively vetoed if I want to play avant-garde or get maximum benefit for systems. The “selected weapons” and “selected armour” for the season unnecessarily limits buildcrafting. It took ages to get some Exotics in previous expansions and now using them is effectively a damage penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Love the Tier system, great way to improve loot and soft sunset old gear. The enforcement of using new gear sucks though, I’d rather just incentivise the new stuff by making it strong or having good artefact synergies, rather than just banning old stuff in some playlists.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:&nbsp;</strong> I’m still just playing with my old stuff; nothing they’ve introduced that’s dropped for me feels better so far. I had to massively change my load out to make the guns work with a different type of subclass and playstyle that I liked, so it didn’t synergise well with what I already enjoyed and had built to rely on over a long period of time. Some of the guns I probably would have used if I could craft them to get a roll I wanted that worked with my build, but I’ve played a reasonable amount and had terrible RNG so I stopped caring and went back to using my favourites.</p>

<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>What should Bungie do to bring back lapsed players like myself?</em></p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Meaningful choices in every piece of content, make the whole game matter as opposed to just the new DLC. Why launch half baked mechanics that barely play competently whilst also making everything else not work/count anymore, and funnelling you into playing their half baked ideas to progress?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> “Half baked” is a good point to make. This expansion feels like it’s half baked.</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I definitely kinda want to play D2 right now, but also at the same time, what do I play? And what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Where’s a global pandemic and enforced lockdown when you need it?</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong><em> And finally, what would you score The Edge of Fate out of ten, and why?</em></p>
<p><strong>Lee:&nbsp;</strong> The Edge of Fate brings some much needed freshness to what was a rather stale set of systems, but it is missing some of what you’d expect from a yearly expansion. The campaign was really good with links to historical events while also setting up the future, but that does very much feel like a set up, a block to build on. A solid mystery with plenty to look forward to.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Pros: Good story, great new character in Lodi, armour changes should be positive in the long run, custom difficulties for Portal activities allow more variety even when repeating the same things.</p>
<p>Cons: Kepler is a reasonably unexciting destination, with bland environments, reused textures and lack of Lost Sectors and public events. Mythic difficulty in Kepler is just straight up infuriating.</p>
<p>Also the portal is also somewhat bland in its presentation, but nothing some UI changes can’t improve. Better backwards compatibility with the armour changes would be appreciated.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> It has a good campaign and new systems have promise but need refinement. Some small improvements will go a long way such as adding Dungeon and Raid stuff to Portal.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Needs more time in the oven to be playable. It ruined more of the game than it improved.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Solid campaign, not enough new stuff. All the resetting and changes are attainable without the expansion.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong> I really enjoyed the campaign – it’s still Destiny. The Portal is underutilised and I feel boredom creeping in much faster doing the same six activities on solo ops – we know there are so many things in the game now, and the file size is bigger than it’s ever been, so the DCV&nbsp; (Destiny Content Vault) thing doesn’t really hold water. I like the weapons and armour changes for the most part, but I am frustrated by the arbitrary limitations placed on player choice, much the same way I was with the introduction of champions way back when… but it’s just more of the same. I am enjoying the post campaign stuff on Kepler, which is actually more fun now that the story beats have subsided. It’s a step down after the glory of The Final Shape but I’m still enjoying it and continuing to play it, despite my gripes.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> <em>Thank you everyone!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So there we go, I make that an average score of 5.6, which is distinctly, well, average. Destiny 2 is not dead in the water yet, and it’s a game that has been through many ups and downs and could return to glory with the right content. <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_08_07_2025">Bungie have already stated</a> that they are going to change a lot of things and update 9.1.0, and while this does not have a release date, it will include “new activities and rewards in both The Edge of Fate and the Core Game.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brUCTPKn6KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the Star Wars ‘inspired’ expansion, Renegades, which will launch this Christmas, but Bungie are going to have to pull something really special out of the bag to bring back players. Perhaps even more than ever, as the days of leaning on Star Wars for an instant win, as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubisofts-slump-continues-star-wars-174911115.html">proven by Ubisoft’s Star Wars Outlaws</a>, are in the past.</p>

              <p>We now know when <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> is coming out, how much it will cost, and that it’s not coming to Switch 2 at launch, at least if a new report from Dealabs writer billbil-kun is to believed, and they usually are. The apparent leaks raise questions about why the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is still coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but not Nintendo’s newest hardware which is more capable than both of those platforms.</p> <p>According <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383">to billbil-kun</a>, Microsoft will be revealing the launch info for <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873"><em>Black Ops 7</em> at Gamescom next week</a>. That includes European pricing of €80, its standard cost overseas, suggesting it will also remain at $70 in the U.S. despite warnings earlier in the year that Microsoft would be raising the prices of some of its fall releases. The company retreated from that with<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014">The Outer Worlds 2</a></em> earlier this summer, and now it appears <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t be crossing the $80 Rubicon either.</p> <p>The release date for <em>Black Ops 7</em> is apparently November 14, the latest an entry in the annualized multiplayer shooter franchise has ever appeared (this <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945861417485099010">corroborates a similar leak from July</a>). But billbil-kun writes that none of the release information currently mentions Switch 2, making it seem unlikely the game will arrive on the handheld hybrid this year despite a 10-year agreement between Microsoft and Nintendo to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to the platform.</p>

 <p>While Activision confirmed both sides are still committed to making that happen <a href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">with plans to reveal more information in the future</a>, it seems like <em>Call of Duty</em> is skipping Nintendo’s consoles again for the 12th year in a row, and two years into Microsoft’s completed acquisition of the publisher. One possible reason for the delay is that Nintendo has been just as stingy with sharing Switch 2 dev kits with Microsoft as with anyone else.</p> <p>While Activision executives met with Nintendo to discuss the specs for the Switch 2 in December of 2022, it’s possible the company was among those third-party development partners who missed out on pre-release access to the new hardware to begin porting games over to it. That shortage, potentially fueled by Nintendo’s paranoia about leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-console-power-playstation-4-xbox-one-1850850348">has reportedly led to</a> lots of developers playing catch up with the Switch 2’s release. Even the makers of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it seems.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> for PlayStation 5 edges closer and closer to its October release date, but if you are finding the wait hard to take then this short but sweet gameplay trailer might ease your suffering.</p>
<p>While this gameplay snippet is only a mere glimpse at just 30 seconds, it does show off the combat you'll be treated to in the full game. As the lead character Atsu dispatches foes on a bridge, you'll see how she can utilise sand to startle and disable foes, and also send enemies to their deaths by pushing them off the edge of high platforms.</p>

<p>Key to this gameplay clip is the Yari spear, one of the many weapons you'll be able to use in the game. As well as being lethal in its own right, the Yari spear can also be used as a way for Atsu to propel herself forwards into enemies.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei from Sucker Punch is set to release exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. The game follows the 2020 PS4 game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, which went on to release on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A couple of years ago, Neo Berlin 2087 was announced for PC and PS5 showing us a mix of detective thriller and some gunfights. Now, a new trailer has been released and it seems to show how many different games have been used as an influence. There seems to be a mix of Deus Ex, Call of Duty, various zombie games, and maybe a hint of Vanquish due to the character’s armour. Chuck in some other influences, like the Morpheus like character lifted from the Matrix too and you have Neo Berlin 2087.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neo Berlin 2087 - Gamescom 2025 Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8B89MssneU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Neo Berlin 2087 says,&nbsp;<em>“The game is set in Berlin, in the year 2087. Technological advancements and cyberization have divided society into a two class system, where the rich are ruling over the city while the poor are fighting for survival inside the slums and in the deadly wasteland outside the city walls. In a story about justice, friendship, love, guilt and betrayal, we combine the best elements of science fiction in a way that has never been experienced before.”</em></p>
<p>As you can see from the gameplay, the RPG switches constantly between first person perspective and third person perspective, which suggests players will be able to choose which view to use. There is a copious amount of bullet time gunfights, some sneaking in a dark tunnel, zombie like creatures chasing the main character, a crime scene to investigate, and some uncanny valley style facial animations on the characters. Elysium Studio was originally aiming to release Neo Berlin 2087 in 2024, but there is now currently no release date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-acquires-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiple-hardspace-shipbreaker-projects-in-development-as-blackbird-acquires-ip.1271019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blackbird Interactive has announced that it has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>IP from original publisher Focus Entertainment, and that "multiple" projects related to the property are currently in development.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's Steam page, Blackbird Interactive now "fully owns and controls" the IP, and it's "going to become a core part" of the studio's business strategy in the future. If you've been hoping for followups to the game, this seems like pretty great news for you.</p>

<p>In fact, Blackbird says that "multiple&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects are already in development", and that while the studio isn't ready to share specifics for those projects yet, Blackbird is focused on making sure the next <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games "expand on the original game in all the right ways".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-buys-ip-explosion.jpg?itok=1bgGp4s_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-buys-ip-explosion.jpg?itok=13JVh8Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>now falls entirely under the purview of developer Blackbird Interactive.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to reflect Blackbird's ownership of the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>IP,&nbsp;<em>Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>will be getting a small update, mainly including things like "updated splash screens, logos, and privacy policies". If you spot an update for your game, now you know what it is.</p>

<p>Blackbird is quick to reassure players that this won't mean anything in terms of access for&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em>; you'll still be able to play it if you own it on Steam or anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you want your say on how future&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects should go, as well as the chance to potentially playtest new games as and when those tests become available, Blackbird recommends you sign up for something it's calling the <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LYNX Pioneer Program</a>.</p>

<p>The program will offer "exclusive playtests" of new <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games, as well as "behind-the-scenes development updates" and "opportunities to help shape Blackbird Interactive's next generation of games".</p>




<p>According to Blackbird, the split with Focus Interactive isn't acrimonious. The studio thanks Focus for its "partnership and willingness" to work alongside Blackbird in order to transfer IP ownership smoothly.</p>
