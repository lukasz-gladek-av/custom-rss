This could be it.” It’s an answer that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-3-neil-druckmann-sequel-third-game-1851767888&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-3-neil-druckmann-sequel-third-game-1851767888">encouraging to some</a></span> who feel the story has run its course, and no doubt disappointing for others who are holding out hope for more. I’m left somewhere in between. Of course it’s not up to me at all, but my pie-in-the-sky hope is that we do see a sequel of sorts to <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, a kind of coda to conclude the series. But rather than being packed with more of the suspenseful violence that helped make <em>The Last of Us </em>one of the most well-known game franchises of all time, I hope the sequel leaves it behind entirely. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,195896" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(<strong>Note</strong>: this post will discuss the ending of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so if you’re only discovering the story via the TV show, there may be what you consider <strong>spoilers ahead.</strong>)</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The remarks, which Druckmann made during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with <em>Variety</em></a></span>, aren’t the worst news I could have heard about the future of <em>The Last of Us. </em>If my choices are between another hyperviolent entry in the series and no game at all, I’ll choose the latter, because while I admire the first two games, I don’t think there’s anywhere meaningful left to take from the violence at their core. The characters have  already suffered so much, endured so much, and wrought so much violence themselves; what’s to be gained from seeing them continue to be trapped in this vicious cycle, enacting even more brutal violence on each other?</p><p>No. In my opinion, the only place to go from the second game’s crescendo of brutality and bloodshed, which ultimately sees one major character spare the life of another she has fought very hard to kill, is to explore who these characters become and what they’re left with <em>after </em>breaking the cycle. The only meaningful way forward for the series, it seems to me, is in seeing these characters forge some kind of new path for themselves that, at long last, leaves the violence which has exacted such a terrible price behind.</p><p>In all likelihood, such a game would never get made because that violence is considered core to the series’ marketability. The nailbiting and often staggeringly brutal combat is what makes them blockbusters. And yet, if any studio working in the so-called “AAA” space can challenge the notion that a game in a franchise like <em>The Last of Us</em> needs to involve violence, it’s Naughty Dog. After all, this is the team that produced the work which, more than any other game up to this point, goes against the conventional wisdom about M-rated AAA games: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675"><em>Left Behind</em></a></span>, the story-focused DLC expansion for <em>The Last of Us. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This release took mechanics that had been components of the original game’s brutal combat—stealthy sneaking, brick throwing, and so on--and recontextualized them as the stuff of bonding and play between Ellie and her friend (and crush) Riley while they explore an abandoned mall. <em>Left Behind </em>did still have combat in it; Ellie had to fight both humans and infected in the game’s “present day,” in between flashbacks to her trip to the mall with Riley. Even so, the DLC chapter<em> </em>illuminated the possibility for releases to exist in the AAA space that are more about storytelling, character interaction, and environmental exploration than about traditional video-game action.</p><p>So here’s what I’d love a follow-up to <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>to be: a new chapter, perhaps somewhat akin to <em>Left Behind</em>, that de-emphasizes combat or abandons it altogether, and focuses its energies entirely on bringing the story to a close that shows the characters carrying on their lives now that the circle of violence has been broken. Who can they be, now that they are no longer pursuing vengeance? What kind of relationships can they form? What kind of world can they try to build, for themselves and each other? I think these are fascinating questions, rich with storytelling possibility. I especially want to see Lev, a character introduced in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>who is only just beginning to come into his own by the time the game ends, get to discover and define himself.</p><p>Truth be told, I think the shocking violence of the existing two games could be given new meaning if we really get to see the characters, at long last, finding their way out of it, out of its limiting and destructive patterns that have cost them all so much. We are not doomed to live that way. We can make better choices. And the remarkable thing about such a game is that, in illuminating new possibilities for the lives of its characters, it would also show new possibilities for the realm of AAA games. </p><figure id="" data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t think it has to be a 25-hour epic like <em>Part II </em>was. A coda that just lasts three hours or so, and that maybe sells for $20, would be just fine. We know Naughty Dog isn’t abandoning blockbuster video game action; they’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128?_gl=1*4y8uu8*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTc1NDk0Mi40OS4xLjE3NDE3NTYzOTEuMTEuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128?_gl=1*4y8uu8*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTc1NDk0Mi40OS4xLjE3NDE3NTYzOTEuMTEuMC4w">the very high-concept <em>Intergalactic </em></a></span>in the works. I think that game looks rad, and I hope it sells like hotcakes. But what if, in addition to doing mainstream commercial work like that, Naughty Dog was able, with Sony’s full support, to produce something riskier, something less commercial that defied the rigid expectations that hold so much sway in mainstream gaming? Isn’t there value in making bold artistic choices, in broadening people’s notions of what’s possible within a space? It may not make heaps of money, but I bet a move like that would earn respect and be very exciting to those who care about games as an art form.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a piece about <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></span>, I lamented all the things the game, in its endless, indulgent violence, didn’t show us:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Why don’t we get to see Ellie doing the work of trying to be a better person? Why don’t we get to see her trying to rebuild things with Dina, and trying to internalize what Joel said to her, that she deserves to love and be loved? Because these remain the limits of AAA games. Because that’s the part where no shooting happens, and therefore it remains outside the scope of a game like this. Because we’re still so trapped.</p></blockquote><p>We don’t have to be trapped anymore, though. Naughty Dog has demonstrated that it’s more than capable of brilliantly creating the kind of interactive storytelling that could give <em>The Last of Us </em>the poignant, meaningful coda it deserves. I don’t really want a standard <em>Part III </em>for this series, not if it comes with even more of the horrifying, senseless, profoundly costly violence that has defined the series up to this point. But a game that breaks that cycle? That lets the series end on a note of tenderness, of muted, grounded hope for a better world or a different way of life? Yeah. That I’d like to see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideki-kamiya-says-%E2%80%9Ci-couldn%E2%80%99t-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul%E2%80%9D-on-his-decision-to-leave-platinumgames.1132185/</guid>

<p>In a new interview, Hideki Kamiya has explained in more detail on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>Speaking with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> and picked up on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Hideki Kamiya went into depth about his reason on leaving PlatinumGames in 2023.</p>



<p>“The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company’s way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn’t place importance on the creators’ individuality,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued, “Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn’t allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn’t agree with.”</p>



<p>Hideki Kamiya was one of four founders of PlatinumGames, which was founded in October 2007. After leaving the studio, Kamiya went on to found CLOVERS inc. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Kamiya <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideki-kamiya-scalebound-develop-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest in wanting to return to developing Scalebound</a>, a game that was in development in partnership with Xbox and announced in 2014. The game was cancelled by Microsoft in 2017 for apparent issues with Unreal Engine and a lack of experience at the studio creating some of the games core elements. In addition, it was also said that the game couldn’t live up to the players high expectations.</p>



<p>As for if Scalebound will happen again remains to be seen, but for now, we’ll have to wait for CLOVERS or Kamiya to announce their first project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Kamiya leaving PlatinumGames? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

I have every belief Pokémon GO will further flourish as part of Scopely, not only into its second decade, but for many more years to come, under the mission of discovering Pokémon in the real world and inspiring people to explore together,” Wu continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our new partnership, along with our decade long partnership with The Pokémon Company, means we can maintain this long-term focus. Scopely fully believes in our mission and ongoing goal to create the best Pokémon Go experience possible. Their focus will be to support our team, providing resources to continue delivering the gameplay you all know and love.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The entire Pokémon Go team is staying together through this partnership. The same people who have been guiding and building the game for years will continue doing what we love. We’re always continually adding to the game - Raid Battles, friends, Go Battle League, Routes, Dynamax/Gigantamax, and, of course, Pokémon Go Fest and our live events - which I look forward to continuing to do for many years to come. Scopely empowers their game teams as autonomous groups to go after the roadmaps that they’re inspired to pursue, and what each team believes is best for the player experience. This approach is extremely appealing to us at Niantic games. I have spoken to a number of game leaders at Scopely who have given me great confidence in how the company enables each game to independently develop and creatively thrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will be joining a broader organization dedicated to games. I believe that Pokémon Go can continue to thrive with Scopely’s exclusive and long-term focus on game-making. Scopely’s status as a private company also means we can prioritize what’s best for you, our Trainers, for the long term. We believe that prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of our long-term mission would be counterproductive and self-defeating. Every interaction I’ve had with Scopely leaders has reinforced that we are in total agreement that the scale, longevity and most of all, real world community, of Pokémon Go make it truly special. We are united in protecting that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Scopely’s full commitment, experience and resources, we’re going to make Pokémon Go the very best it can be – with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokémon in the real world. We have invested to empower thousands of Community Leaders and Ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together. The real-world community that loves Pokémon Go will remain our guiding light in all we do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our partners at The Pokémon Company have always been central to how we build this game together, starting with the physics of the first Poké Ball throw that we hand-tuned together. I am incredibly grateful for their daily wisdom, guidance, and careful stewardship of our shared vision for discovering Pokémon in the real world, and I’m very excited that our partnership with The Pokémon Company will continue as it has for the last decade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I won’t say that Pokémon Go will remain the same, because it has always been a work in progress. But how we create and evolve it will remain unchanged, and I hope that we can make the experience even better for all of you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have so much gratitude for the incredible joy of serving hundreds of millions of Trainers in our real-world community for the past nine years, and I truly believe the best is yet to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Niantic said it’s spinning off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-players-have-been-training-an-ai-to-auto-complete-the-real-world">its controversial geospatial AI business</a> into a new company, Niantic Spatial Inc., “enabling it to accelerate and scale even more rapidly.” Scopely is a $50 million investor in this new venture, which also has $200 million from Niantic itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic Spatial will continue to own and operate its other real-world AR games, Ingress Prime and Peridot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, after a string of critical and commercial flops, Capcom was on its knees. It had lost its way <em>and</em> its audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom was suffering from an identity crisis. Resident Evil, which established the survival horror genre, had lost its bite after Resident Evil 4. Another big hitter, Street Fighter, was on the ropes after the poorly-received Street Fighter 5. It could easily have been the critical end of Capcom and its much-loved games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the darkness, there was light. A change in the way Capcom made its games, supported by a powerful new game engine, gave these much-loved series a new lease of life, and kickstarted years of critical and financial success that catapulted Capcom back into the big league.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Lost Its Way</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/09/15/baitguardpng-9b2882.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil 6 marked a low point for the mainline series.

Meanwhile, Street Fighter 5 was met by a collective eyebrow raise from longtime fans who could hardly believe this lackluster fighting game was the sequel to the brilliant Street Fighter 4. And Dead Rising 4, which featured the long-awaited return of beloved photojournalist Frank West, would end up being the series’ final new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the low ebb of a string of forgettable years Capcom had endured since 2010. The mainline Resident Evil games were met with diminishing critical reception despite strong sales. Street Fighter was on the ropes thanks to a poorly received new entry, and Capcom mainstays like Devil May Cry were nowhere to be seen. Meanwhile, the company’s most popular and successful franchise at the time, Monster Hunter, was huge in Japan but struggled breaking into international markets.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this is a far cry from the Capcom we know today.  Since 2017, Capcom has been one of the few major development studios that has rarely missed a beat. The Osaka-based company has released a stream of hit games from its most famous franchises, racking up both sales and accolades. We’re talking about a run of releases that includes Monster Hunter World, Devil May Cry 5, Street Fighter 6, and a trio of industry-leading remakes plus an acclaimed soft reboot of the Resident Evil series. In short: lately, Capcom seems incapable of failure. .</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving this success took more than simply learning from mistakes. Capcom had to re-think its entire strategy, from the type of players it targeted to the technology it used, to make such a turnaround possible. To learn more about this seismic shift, IGN sat down with four of Capcom’s leading creatives to find out how one of gaming’s most successful gaming companies tripped, fell, and picked itself up better than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom was founded in 1979 as a maker of electronic game machines, or “capsule computers”. It rose to ascendency during the 80s and 90s thanks to 2D games like Street Fighter and Mega Man, and then made the all-important  jump to 3D with games like Resident Evil. Between 2000 and 2010 Capcom successfully transitioned many of its big, golden-era franchises into the modern age, a process that gave birth to one of the greatest games of all time: Resident Evil 4. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/29/re4speedrunbr-1565373045580-1638184942390.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The GOAT Resident Evil game? Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2005’s Resident Evil 4 is considered by many to be a generational high point thanks to its ingenious mix of horror and action. But that mix altered the course of the Resident Evil franchise dramatically. At its core, Resident Evil 4 is a horror game, inspired by the likes of Friday the 13th, H.P. Lovecraft, and the works of John Carpenter. But sprinkled between the strands of its horror DNA are tremendously effective moments of Hollywood action cinema. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this ideal balance between horror and action was lost in  subsequent games.  In 2009’s Resident Evil 5, hero Chris Redfield punches a car-sized boulder with his bare fists, and infected enemies are gunned down in a car-chase sequence that’s more Fast and Furious than frightening.  The series was losing its identity and this was clear to both players and the developers like Resident Evil 4 remake director Yasuhiro Ampo who’s been working on Resident Evil games since 1996.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall throughout the Resident Evil series, we set up different goals, challenges, and things we want to try with each game… But this time, many of us started feeling that what the fans and players wanted from the series was getting a little bit separate from what we were making,” Ampo says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This directional confusion would result in games like 2012’s Resident Evil 6, a game that tried to have its cake and eat it too. In order to please both action and horror fans, Resident Evil 6 split the game between six playable characters and three unique storylines. Each section catered to either horror or action fans, and so never achieved that all-important balance of both genres, which ultimately left nobody truly satisfied. Disgruntled fans shared their disappointment in these new, action-packed Resident Evil games online, while the developers continued experimenting with spinoffs that ventured into new territory like online co-op. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This downward trend was not exclusive to Capcom’s survival horror series, though. Not so long after the release of Resident Evil 4, the company’s Street Fighter team was also flying high. Street Fighter 4 was an instant hit thanks to its unique art-style and great cast of new and returning characters. It became an immediate hit at fighting game tournaments and in college dorms alike.But, like with Resident Evil, Capcom failed to match those highs with a sequel. Compared to its imaginative and full-fledged predecessor, 2016’s Street Fighter 5 was criticized for releasing barebones with hardly any single player content, as well as its abysmal online functionality. Fans cite a clear lack of polish and a confusing philosophy towards balance that made the overall experience just plain frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it wasn’t just Street Fighter and Resident Evil that were struggling. Almost every key franchise struggled to make a mark. Devil May Cry, the studio’s popular, heavy-metal action game was seeing diminishing returns to the point where Capcom outsourced the next game in the series, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry, to UK-based studio Ninja Theory. While it’s gone on to become something of a cult title, DmC’s fresh take on the series’ mythology, redesigned protagonist, and sluggish 30fps frame rate was met with vitriol from online fans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after such a muted reception the series was shelved until further notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This slate of misfortunes defines the Capcom of the early to mid-2010s. Key franchises struggled to replicate the successes of the past, while other titles were put in cold storage. New games attempting to capture the western market, like Lost Planet and Asura’s Wrath, also failed to land with audiences. There was the odd bright spot, like Dragon’s Dogma, the new dark fantasy RPG from Devil May Cry director Hideaki Itsuno, but for the most part Capcom’s focus was all over the place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was clear something needed to change.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Street Fighter 5, The Lost Cause</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/10/27/streetfighter5-dhalsim-6jpg-996e0f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Street Fighter 5 was a let down. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By the mid-2010s Capcom had begun to enact a number of strategy-shifting changes that would totally transform the company’s fate. Such changes had to begin small, and so the first matter of business was putting out the existing fires. Street Fighter 5 needed to be fixed. And so Capcom enlisted director Takayuki  Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto to help steer the troubled game towards stability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While neither were there from the ground floor of Street Fighter 5’s development, and therefore can’t detail why Street Fighter 5 was released in the state it was, the duo inherited a game that greatly needed some substantial fixes in order to regain the trust of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There definitely were some challenges within the production of the game, and that was part of the reason why I was brought into the team,” Nakayama admits. “And because we were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/10/01/21630094529dcaaa5266cojpg-b6a32e.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Street Fighter 5 would be improved into Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those constraints severely limited the scope of what the pair could achieve. And so rather than transform Street Fighter 5 into a S-tier game, much of the work Nakayama did was fixing the game’s most pressing problems and biding his time until work could begin on Street Fighter 6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We just didn’t really have enough time to address some of the problems and challenges we faced in Street Fighter V," Nakayama says. "And so, with our hands tied behind our backs, we basically had to wait for those ideas to be brought back for the initial conceptual phases for Street Fighter 6, so we could tackle and do things properly for the next title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this considered, why did Capcom not just end Street Fighter 5’s development and begin working right away on a sequel? If it was such a weight around the necks of the developers, couldn’t they just start from scratch? According to Matsumoto, abandoning Street Fighter 5 just wasn’t in the cards. <em><strong>“</strong></em>There wasn’t any sort of sense of like, ‘Okay let’s just end Street Fighter 5 and focus on Street Fighter 6.’ It was more like, while we were working on Street Fighter V, we were trying to figure out what we really wanted to do in Street Fighter 6 content-wise,” he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Basically, we tried different things during the development of Street Fighter 5 to see if it worked and then we took the things that did work and applied that to Street Fighter 6. It was like the development of Street Fighter V was an ongoing process that helped us figure out, ‘Okay, what is it that we want to do for the next level?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We were in a point in development where we couldn’t really make any major pivots or shifts, we had to proceed and move forward in the direction we were currently in, which created constraints on what we could and couldn’t do.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The team treated Street Fighter 5 as a lab where they could learn from their design mistakes and figure out what to do differently for the sequel. The years-long process required careful consideration of the game’s every core aspect, which informed  several important changes . There were numerous updates, starting with the fundamentals like steady improvements to the netcode and character re-balances, and progressing all the way up to new characters, V-Triggers, and even entire new mechanics like V-Shift, a new defensive move that provided a brief window of invincibility that the devs were considering introducing in Street Fighter 6 but decided to test in Street Fighter 5.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a much larger goal for all these improvements beyond just elevating the game to an acceptable level, though. Capcom was on a mission to rediscover the fun. At the end of the day, fighting games should be enjoyable to play, but Street Fighter 5 had become a somewhat frustrating discipline to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We both realized that fighting games are fun, and when you get used to them, it becomes more enjoyable and something you can essentially play forever as long as you have an opponent to play against,” Matsumoto says.  “However, one of the challenges that we faced with Street Fighter V is that we felt that there wasn’t a clear pathway that helped guide players to get to that level where they finally feel like they’re having fun and will want to continue playing.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Street Fighter had previously tried to be more approachable by lowering the difficulty, but this only served to turn off longtime fans. Instead, Street Fighter 6’s approach was to expand the tools available to new players while giving experienced fans everything they already loved about the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they could have cut their losses on Street Fighter 5 and immediately tried to win fans back with a sequel, Nakayama and Masuhiro knew that this would be a shortcut that didn’t grow Street Fighter in any meaningful way. But by sticking with Street Fighter 5 and using it as a testbed for new ideas, 2023’s Street Fighter 6 was able to launch as one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the entire franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Matsumoto and Nakayama were able to take the work put into Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition and apply the lessons they learned to Street Fighter 6, it was important that Capcom did not repeat these kinds of situations and be forced into having to overhaul games again. A significant shift in strategy was needed that would prevent such a disaster ever happening. And that’s where a couple of vital behind-the-scenes changes came into play.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Took Over The World</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/08/monsterhunterworld-blogroll-1516867463450-1667927878979.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The start of the Monster Hunter revolution. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.”&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch.The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the widespread adoption of mobile consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“20 years ago in Japan, having a network connection wasn't as easy, and there weren’t a huge amount of people playing Monster Hunter online. However, handheld consoles made multiplayer gameplay easy without internet access, and I regard it as a great success that we had players experience the game in this way, which was one of the ways we really wished for them to play and enjoy it, even in that era when online gameplay wasn't easy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s mobile games market, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reality was that Monster Hunter <em>did </em>have fans in the west, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For World, we conducted focus tests across the world, and some of the feedback and opinions that we got during that process really affected how we designed our game systems and impacted how much success we had globally,”<em><strong> </strong></em>Tsujimoto says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really about getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 7 Began Turning Things Around</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/09/19/03bmpjpgcopyjpg-fe1366.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Welcome to the family. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter had a winning formula.The challenge Capcom faced was finding ways to convince global audiences to give it a shot. But it was not such a straightforward task for every series in the company’s portfolio. When it came to Resident Evil, the development team had to decide which of the series’ intertwined formulas was a winner; gory action or survival horror. Ultimately it was Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi who made the call. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was around the time I was working on Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2. I was trying to test different things, try different approaches,” recalls Resident Evil 2 and 4 Remake director Yasuhiro Ampo recalls. “And around this time is when the R&amp;D teams were divided into R&amp;D division one and two. The executive producer of the Resident Evil series, Jun Takeuchi, took command of R&amp;D division one, and he set the core direction that the Resident Evil series needed to go back to its origins, to its roots.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Takeuchi ruled that Resident Evil must focus on survival horror as its guiding light. This proved to be the right decision. Resident Evil 7 was announced at PlayStation’s E3 2016 conference with a moody trailer shot in first-person, showing the insides of a dilapidated house. I was there in attendance when the Roman numeral for seven appeared, followed by the title Resident Evil. The convention hall roared in excitement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There were, of course, questions about how Resident Evil could make the jump to first-person. By that point, third-person, over-the-shoulder gunplay had become synonymous with the series. It turns out, however, that in exchange for moving to a first-person perspective, Resident Evil regained something it had lost: It became scary again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Resident Evil 7, the executive producer, Jun Takeuchi, made it clear that we cannot underestimate how critical it is for the series for it to be scary and about survival. So he made it clear that Resident Evil 7 would go back to its origins, it would be very cautious with its survival elements. And with that as a basis, then we would try new and different things,” Ampo says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was a hit. While maybe not quite operating on the same level as Resident Evil 4, this significant shift in direction allowed for a welcome return to survival horror. Thanks to its unsettling and claustrophobic southern gothic setting, Resident Evil 7 ranks as one of the scariest games in the entire series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Capcom wasn’t going to abandon the third-person perspective that was so key to the series’ DNA. While new mainline titles like Resident Evil 7 and 8 would stay in first-person, Capcom planned to release third-person games through a series of brand-new remakes, starting with Resident Evil 2. Capcom realized there was a demand for remakes thanks to the appearance of several fan projects at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was like, ‘all right people really want this to happen.’ So producer [Yoshiaki] Hirabayashi came up with the slogan: ‘Well, we’ll do it,’” Ampo reveals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is one of the best games in the entire series. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a perfect blend of horror, combining all the action and puzzles fans have come to expect from the series with a new menacing Tyrant system that allows the hulking Mr. X to continuously stalk you throughout the Raccoon City police station. Under Ampo’s direction, Resident Evil 2 Remake became the second best-selling Resident Evil game in the franchise’s history. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Capcom would follow up its incredible success with a remake of Resident Evil 3, another PlayStation 1 game that could clearly benefit from a modern reinvention. But, following that, surely Capcom wouldn’t remake Resident Evil 4 – a game that still felt refreshingly modern despite being almost 20 years old. Why touch something many  considered to be almost perfect?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ampo reveals that there was some hesitation to tackle Resident Evil 4 for sure. “As you mentioned, [Resident Evil 4] was still a title that enjoyed some popularity. So there was a lot of internal discussion on how maybe it’s not a good idea. Maybe we don’t need a remake for Resident Evil 4, especially because Resident Evil 4 is a game that is so beloved. If we get anything wrong with the remake, people might be quite vocal about their discomfort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But despite any initial hesitation, the team pushed through with a remake and the results speak for themselves. Resident Evil 4 Remake was another bonafide hit. Much of its success comes down to the biggest changes, which were focused on fine-tuning the action-horror ratio to achieve Takeuchi’s goal of keeping the series true to its survival horror roots. And so gone were some of the original game’s campier elements,  replaced by a moodier, darker tone that still kept the heart-pounding action hero moments.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/09/re4-chainsawdemo-1-blogroll-1678402594429.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horror reborn. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Around the same time as Resident Evil’s rediscovery of its horror core, longtime Devil May Cry director, Hideaki Itsuno, had a similar epiphany. After a brief sojourn into the RPG world with Dragon’s Dogma, Itsuno watched as the action genre began to soften in order to appeal to a more casual audience. And so when the chance to direct Devil May Cry 5 arrived, Itsuno saw an opportunity to challenge the audience of a genre he felt was in need of a good kick in the ass. He would do so in spectacular fashion, achieved by leveraging the company’s most powerful game engine to date.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Reason Behind The Change</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/11/dmc5-screen3-1528682163426.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The goal? Make the coolest game ever. Credit: Capcom.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I felt like the main trend with action games was to make action games that were very kind,” Itsuno admits. “Maybe, for me, a little bit too kind to the players, lending a hand to the player too much to my liking.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itsuno took over director duties on Devil May Cry starting with the second game in the series, and has since helmed every new iteration, save for Ninja Theory’s DmC.  Following the release of Devil May Cry 4 in 2008, it would be almost 11 years before Itsuno directed another Devil May Cry game. But when he did finally return, he would oversee one of the most critically and financially successful games in the entire franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10 years away from the franchise gave Itsuno time to figure out where he wanted to take the series. And more importantly he would return with a new arsenal of tech. "Technology-wise, there were not just little improvements that you would have when you work on a series consecutively," Itsuno says. "When there’s a wide timeframe, [the technology] changes significantly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This vision coincided with the launch of Capcom’s new RE Engine. It’s the engine that most of Capcom’s games run on today. Replacing the old MT Framework that had powered everything from Dead Rising to Monster Hunter World, the major upshot of the RE Engine was its handling of photorealistic assets. This gave Capcom’s development teams access to higher levels of visual fidelity than ever before. It was also much nimbler than its predecessor, making it easier to implement changes if something wasn’t working as it should. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ampo tells me  the origins of the RE Engine thus, "So the original concept for the RE Engine was to allow for a development environment that was less stressful and could help us to make things quicker. Because it’s an internally developed engine, when we needed any additional tools, well, we could ask for them internally. They could be fixed somewhat quickly, internally, and also iterated on.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This meant Capcom’s developers could also trial-and-error development choices on the fly. This proved vital for Itsuno, whose goal was to make the “coolest” action game of all time. That meant a lot of trial-and-error to make sure everything from the way the game looked to the way it played was as slick and stylish as possible. The RE Engine’s combination of rapid development tools and photorealistic capabilities meant Itsuno was able to increase the pure style of Devil May Cry by magnitudes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Devil May Cry is a franchise that stands on being cool,” Itsuno says. “That’s what the franchise is, it’s about being cool. Ever since I took over the series from Devil May Cry 3, I put everything that I, as a person, I considered throughout my life to be cool. Anything I’ve seen on TV, in movies, and comics I’ve read, any sport experiences I’ve had, I try to distill everything that I think is cool into what the game is.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A New Capcom Golden Age</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 2017, Capcom has released a game of the year contender on a nearly annual basis. In a time when major studios are struggling to find consistency, Capcom’s winning streak of 10 critically acclaimed games in less than a decade is a major outlier. That trend only looks to continue with Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Focusing on a central goal of creating globally appealing games, all built with a technologically advanced engine capable of powering a multitude of different genres, proved to be a formula for unprecedented success. The Capcom of today is able to elegantly switch from laser-focused fighting games to tight survival horror to sprawling open-world action RPGs without missing a beat. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But what’s more impressive is that Capcom’s mission of making global, mainstream games did not dilute its games in the slightest. Instead, Capcom appears to have found the ultimate balance of keeping its games true to themselves — whether that’s the pure survival horror of Resident Evil, competitive spirit of Street Fighter, or the unique battle systems of Monster Hunter — all while expanding the audience for these games by millions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of Capcom’s contemporaries are now finding themselves where Capcom was just a decade ago — fruitlessly chasing trends and losing sight of their identities. But for Capcom, the changes it made over the past decade has resulted in a new golden age that shows no sign of slowing down. Capcom may have fallen, but it has risen up better than ever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked if they believe this is a new Capcom Golden Age, the directors largely agreed. Street Fighter’s Nakayama tells me, “It’s a very exciting time to be at Capcom right now. A lot of us are able to get excited about what we’re working on and are able to focus on things that we think are fun. So, yes, I guess a golden age may be one interpretation of that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter’s Tsujimoto put it more plainly: “Capcom is going through a golden era, and, well, now we have to do everything we can so that this lasts one more year, one more year, and every year, one more year. Hopefully we can extend it as long as we can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Gonna pretend this was never released and continue to enjoy Legacy version until the new game comes out when I'm 60.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm leaving a negative review mainly due to Rockstar deciding that some accounts should arbitrarily not be able to migrate, and if you ask for help from support, they just say they can't do anything about it,” reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't migrate either of my two accounts," another negative review reads.

			<p>Dino Crisis may be the next CAPCOM series to see a proper comeback in the future, following the return of the Onimusha and Okami franchises, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu on Bluesky, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis on March 4th in Japan. By itself, this doesn't mean much, as companies file a lot of trademarks that end up getting unused just to hold onto their IPs, but there are good reasons to be hopeful in this case. As highlighted by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-trademarked-dino-crisis-on-march-4-in-japan.1131402/post-136887345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jawmuncher</a>, any trademark filed in Japan usually shows how a company has a real intention to do something with the IP, and there's a precedence of CAPCOM actually reviving a franchise following a similar trademark filing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha series.</a></p>

<p>While the Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, the survival horror series by CAPCOM has already made a very small comeback with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">recent GOG releases</a> of the first two entries, complete with new features such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. Hopefully, the re-release of the two classic games won't be the end of the series, although series creator Shinji Mikami believes CAPCOM has no reason to<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/"> bring back Dino Crisis while the Monster Hunter series continues to be successful.</a></p>

<p>Pokemon Go developer Niantic has confirmed that Monopoly Go maker Scopely has acquired its games business for $3.5 billion.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There's an old myth in the theater world that Shakespeare's Macbeth is cursed, and any theatre company who tries to put it on will endure some sort of misfortune during the production. One area that hasn't been tested yet, though, is video games--until now, as upstart Specto Studio, led by a former theater director, has announced Hail Macbeth for consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Hail Macbeth is a third-person narrative adventure and an adaptation of the classic Shakespearean play, where players will assume the role of an "unseen force" guiding Macbeth through the story. They will work against what the official announcement calls "the witches," which are "embedded into the game’s UI, subtly revealing or obscuring information, shifting perspective, and distorting reality in ways that make players question the limits of their control."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458186" data-ratio="0.56289808917197" data-width="1256" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458186"></a><figcaption>Hail MacBeth concept art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458187,1300-4458188,1300-4458189,1300-4458190,1300-4458191" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unlike the original work, this version of Macbeth will be set in an alternate version of the 1990s, with castles, corporate high-rises, and “industrial ruins." The game's script, however, will retain the exact wording from Shakespeare's original work, and the studio has scanned real-world costumes and props into the game in order to "achieve a sense of lived-in reality."</p><p dir="ltr">Specto Studio is led by Paolo Sacerdoti, a former theater director, and the team is made up of "an elite team of game-industry veterans," with games like Detroit: Become Human, Horizon Forbidden West, Hellblade 2, Alan Wake 2, and The Last of Us listed among their previous projects. The studio previously worked on Roseline, the first-ever interactive theater experience in Italy, in 2018.</p><p dir="ltr">Hail Macbeth is scheduled to launch in Q1 2026 for "consoles and PC," with more information due "in the coming months."</p>

                <p>Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer Scopely has announced that it'll be acquiring Niantic's video game division, paying $3.5 billion for the developer behind Pokemon Go. Also included in the proposed deal--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/">which was revealed several weeks back</a>--are several other Niantic titles, like Monster Hunter Now and Pikmin Bloom. This is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 biggest gaming buyout in history.</a></p><p>"With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we're going to make Pokemon Go the very best it can be--with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokemon in the real world," Niantic studio leader Ed Wu said in a <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We have invested to empower thousands of community leaders and ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together."</p><p>According to Wu, the entire Pokemon Go team will be retained through this new partnership, and Scopely offered the studio a development environment that it found "extremely appealing". The acquisition will still need to pass regulatory approval conditions, and Pokemon Go social companion apps Campfire and Wayfarer will also be included in the deal.</p><p>Pokemon Go was first launched in 2016, quickly becoming a phenomenon in the mobile gaming space. While the game saw healthy growth over the years, the COVID pandemic and lockdowns negatively impacted its popularity, leading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">significant layoffs at the company and canceled projects</a> in recent years.

Niantic Spactial will be a "geospatial AI company powered by a next-generation map" that will allow devices to interact with the physical world.</p>

During this time, we have created several titles of varying scale, but only one of them has received a full-fledged sequel. We're talking about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the FPP slasher released in 2020, which completely changed our fate, allowing us to set sail into broader waters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The year 2020 was a special time for the industry. On one hand, it brought development delays due to the need of adapting to remote work, while on the other, it increased demand for games because of home isolation. There's no denying that we benefited from this while working on the first installment of Ghostrunner. For us as developers, it was a break from the grim pandemic routine, allowing us to bring the game from prototype to release in just 1.5 years. Players appreciated our effort, and in October 2020, they jumped into the post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world we had created.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback and experimentation—the foundations of ">Feedback and experimentation—the foundations of <span>Ghostrunner 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the success of the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we quickly received a proposal from our publisher and current IP owner, 505 Games, to create a sequel. In the meantime, we also released a series of additional content supporting the original game, including a major expansion, Project_Hel, where we had the opportunity to test out some fresh gameplay ideas. These ideas influenced the design decisions made during the conceptual phase of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As examples, I can mention more frequent opportunities to use the protagonist's special abilities and a general focus on extending the player's lifespan in arenas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When preparing for the production of the sequel, we deeply looked for player feedback on forums, Reddit, and our Discord. Luckily, we received plenty of it, but as often happens with the opinions of such a large group of players, several suggestions started to contradict each other. Some players wanted even faster, more challenging, and competitive gameplay, while others requested it to be more organized and slower. We decided to focus on feedback from those who spent the most time in the game, while also keeping in mind the recurring concerns from more casual players, who were quickly turning away from our game because it seemed too difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players wanted us to expand the core combat and movement mechanics, and that's what we focused on. We created more complex level designs, added new enemies with new abilities, and modified those who didn’t fully suit the gameplay, like for example the Wardens—enemies equipped with katanas. The only way to defeat them was to wait for their attack and block it. We replaced them with Shinobi, who can also be outmaneuvered and killed with a strike to the back or disarmed using one of the special abilities. At the same time, they are extremely fast and can run on walls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to the tempo of the gameplay, we wanted to maintain the speed for players who wanted to rush through levels like pros, while also catering to those who complained about the frantic pace in the first game. We found a compromise by adding two very important mechanics – block and stamina – which allow less experienced players to stop, take a breath, calmly assess the situation, and move on. This action is not mandatory for the ultra-skilled players, who can still play the sequel exactly as they rushed through the first installment of the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="From fanbase to wider audience—the real challenge of shaping a sequel">From fanbase to wider audience—the real challenge of shaping a sequel</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's clear that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not a game for everyone, and it was never meant to be. However, aware of the potential benefits of expanding the target audience, we wanted to introduce new features that would make the game more accessible without straying too far from the core mechanics. After all, it’s these mechanics that earned the game the appreciation of a dedicated fanbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We quickly realized that, as a team, we had found ourselves in a completely new situation. We were making a sequel and for the first time we had to meet the expectations of not hundreds or thousands of players, but millions of people from all over the world. After all, each of those players had their own vision of what their ideal </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be. I didn’t expect that this pressure would weigh so heavily on us and, to some extent, even disrupt the creative aspect of game development. Every new feature had to go through a process of double verification—our internal review, followed by a clash with player expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As an interesting behind-the-scenes tidbit, we can tell you that we tested a sword-throwing system, but quickly abandoned the idea in favor of faster and more practical shurikens. We also had concepts that never made it to implementation, like a survival mechanic that would appear during exploration of the wastelands outside the tower. It was built around the idea that the player would not be able to stay in the sun for too long and would have to look for the shade, but we abandoned it due to the potential risk of significantly slowing down the game, as it didn’t support our core gameplay. Some changes were obvious and necessary improvements, like fixing the save system to enable saving during missions, which didn’t always work correctly in the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and often frustrated players. However, these small but impactful changes were few and far between.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Offering players more of what they're looking for">Offering players more of what they're looking for</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What turned out to be a real challenge was our desire to add a motorcycle. The idea was simple, though it might have sounded absurd—our game is already fast, so let’s give Jack (the protagonist of Ghostrunner) a vehicle that allows him to move even faster. The goal was to carry over the rhythm that defines Ghostrunner onto a motorcycle. After months of tweaking the balance and controls (which we eventually made very arcade-ish) and gathering extensive feedback from tests, we managed to deliver a gameplay experience packed with adrenaline, rooted in the fast-paced, trial-and-error mechanic that perfectly aligns with Ghostrunner's core. It’s worth noting that not everything related to the motorcycle was perfect. With a vehicle and an open post-apocalyptic world, we were tempted to explore much larger areas than the levels inside the tower. Looking back, I have to admit it wasn’t the best idea, and although there is a group of fans who enjoyed this more sandbox-like experience, most players didn’t see this element as a good addition. Fortunately, it was only two levels, after which we return to the fast, more linear, and condensed gameplay tracks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, we attempted to achieve what was previously considered impossible, given the budget and the team we had at the time. Step by step, feature by feature, the size and complexity of the game grew closer to the AAA segment. We added elements like a hub with NPCs, dialogue choices, cutscenes blended into the narrative, and a separate roguelike game mode called Roguerunner.exe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To create this unique and complex mode, we drew from the experience gained from Arena Mode in the first game. As an additional mode, Roguerunner.exe offered players a lot: unique, dedicated levels (300 types of combat arenas and 80 parkour challenges), new (and sometimes downright crazy) upgrades to the protagonist’s abilities, and an entirely different emotional experience due to the limited number of attempts for each run. We also utilized some skills that didn’t make it into the main game, such as H.O.T., inspired by the famous Polish indie game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Superhot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where time moves only when the player does.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The dangerous trap of wanting too much">The dangerous trap of wanting too much</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all these new and additional features, along with the separate game mode ready for launch day, the entire project was a massive undertaking for our incredibly talented, yet still under 50-person development team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew that, despite efforts to reach a broader audience, we were still making a hardcore game, which always limits the player base. We introduced a number of changes to balance the gameplay, making it more accessible to newcomers, such as the previously mentioned ability to block attacks, shorter skill cooldowns, powerful special abilities, and a simplified character progression system. However, we didn’t compromise the core of the gameplay, which remains the most hardcore mechanic in our game – one-hit-kill. We couldn’t cross that line, so as not to disappoint the fans of the first game, and we’re proud that we were able to beat this challenge. While designing these adjustments, we feared that they might lead to a sense of blandness and weakness. We were walking on thin ice, but in the end, we stayed on the hardcore side, only slightly reducing its extreme nature. Even though the base version of the sequel may not be as difficult as the first game, the "Hardcore Mode" added shortly after the release is probably even more difficult than the one in the first installment. It offers a challenge designed to be nearly impossible for us, the developers, but we know that our most dedicated players possess skills that far exceed even the most experienced members of our QA team, who have spent thousands of hours in this title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also learned a big lesson from the bosses in Ghostrunner, who weren’t that well-received by players. While making the sequel, we set a goal: each new boss must require a different approach from the player. Our inspiration came from boss fights in FromSoftware games, where bosses telegraph their attacks, and the player must learn the timing and animation sequences. I believe we succeeded in delivering truly unique bosses, whose designs were based on diverse, challenging mechanics.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lessons learned from creating the sequel">Lessons learned from creating the sequel</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting to the point—as they say, appetite comes with eating, and our ambitions have also grown since the release of the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2020. Every day, we asked ourselves whether adding one more feature, a skill, or an additional mechanic would be enough to call the game a true sequel. How much of the gameplay needs to change for players to feel it’s a genuine continuation and not just capitalizing on the success of the original?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s probably no simple answer to these questions, as it all depends on the product. For example, when creating another game in a sports franchise, not much needs to change to make a successful sequel. We made the decision to keep the core of the game intact while adding many premium features around it, effectively expanding the overall gameplay experience with new possibilities and experiences (such as the arcade-style motorcycle riding).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, we achieved our goals, delivering a high-quality product that received great reviews and a nomination for Best Action Game at the 2023 Game Awards. However, it didn’t replicate the commercial success of the first installment, leaving us with a sense of unfulfilled potential. Naturally, the question arises: What could we have done better or differently? Perhaps we should have revisited the core of our gameplay and implemented more drastic changes—shed the pressure of competing with AAA giants and instead focus on further elevating the fundamental mechanics. Only time will tell, as we’re certain we still have a lot to offer our players and the fans of the franchise we’ve created and cherished.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The newly inked agreement includes Niantic’s <em>Pokémon Go, Monster Hunter Now, </em>and<em> Pikmin Bloom</em> mobile gaming titles.</p><p>“Niantic games have always been a bridge to connect people and inspire exploration, and I am confident they will continue to do both as part of Scopely,” said Niantic CEO John Hanke. “I firmly believe this partnership is great for our players and is the best way to ensure that our games have the long-term support and investment needed to be ‘forever games’ that will endure for future generations.”</p><p>The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Should the deal go through, it will also bring Niantic’s social companion apps for <em>Pokémon Go</em> — Campfire and Wayfarer — under Scopely ownership. Scopely says it will gain “Niantic’s entire team of exceptional gamemakers and category-leading games.” However, the <em>Peridot</em> and <em>Ingress</em> AR gaming titles, the latter of which is also supported by the Wayfarer mapping app, will remain under the ownership and development of Niantic Spatial.</p><p><em>Pokémon Go</em> attracted more than 500 million players in its first year, but its popularity was impacted in 2020 when global covid lockdowns kept people inside their homes. The company has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/29/23188812/niantic-layoffs-canceling-projects-transformers">canceled multiple projects</a> and <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/organizational-update?hl=en">laid off at least 310 employees</a> between 2022-2023 in an attempt to “weather the current challenges in the market.”</p><p>Today’s announcement is Saudi Arabia’s latest attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment">muscle its way into the gaming industry</a>, having used its Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire stakes in Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, and EA. The PIF was also used to establish Esports and gaming company Savvy Games Group in 2021, which later acquired <em>Monopoly Go</em>! developer Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023.</p><p>The announcement appears to be the 2025 “megadeal” that Scopely’s chief revenue officer Tim O’Brien teased last year, saying during a Q&amp;A that it would involve “a scaled global franchise doing hopefully at least a billion dollars in revenue.” Niantic Labs doesn’t disclose its earnings to the public, but Scopely said in its announcement that Niantic’s gaming business drove $1 billion in revenue last year, and <em>Pokémon Go</em> alone is <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-go-catches-nearly-8-billion-in-eight-years/">estimated to have brought in $7.9 billion in revenue</a> since launching in 2016.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re talking expanded level caps, new game plus, a brand new difficulty level which grants new skills and weapons, and…weapon reforging. If you’re au fait with <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>and its innumerable spinoffs, weapon reforging should look pretty familiar: If you have two copies of the same weapon, you can merge them to either mix-and-match skills or wholesale increase a weapon’s strength. Do this enough times, and you can theoretically get a +99 weapon with insane attack power. Neat, right?

With my shiny platinum trophy under my belt, I have conquered all the challenges, seen every sight, and felled entire armies by myself. And throughout all of that, not only did I never need reforged weapons to overcome any postgame challenges, I almost made an otherwise easy-to-get trophy way harder on myself. Here’s the breakdown.</p><h2 id="h2717523"><a id=""></a><strong>Why weapon reforging is awesome…in theory</strong></h2><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>weapon reforging <em>technically</em> offers you the best weapons in the game</strong>. As you progress into the endgame, you can find weapons as high as Grade 7 as drops in battle. If you grind out enough Grade 7 weapons, you can merge them into an armament with a whopping 623 Attack stat and a slew of six passive skills of your own choosing. It’s those passives that are key here; normally weapons feature a mix of common and rare passive traits, but nothing’s stopping you from loading your weapon with all rare traits that will push your damage per second to the moon.</p><p>Nothing in the game will quite match the power of a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon. But you <em>will </em>find weapons that come awfully close, and therein lies the rub.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-recommend-id="image://4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the equipment screen from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Rampaging Luan weapon is highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2717524"><a id=""></a><strong>Grade 8 Luan weapons are so much easier to get</strong></h2><p>Yes, while Grade 7 weapons are the best equipment you can find as drops, you can attain mythical Grade 8 “Luan” weapons by completing challenges on the postgame-exclusive Ultimate Warrior difficulty. Considering you can attain these weapons early in your postgame grind, they offer a huge jump in power. We’re talking attack power on par with a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon and a suite of six passive abilities that aren’t <em>great</em>, but are still perfectly acceptable for a non-forged weapon.</p><p>Luan weapons are all unique, so they can’t be upgraded or edited at all via weapon reforging. This is why a maxed out Grade 7 weapon can still outperform a Luan weapon in the end. But is the minor difference in power worth the massive difference in effort?</p><h2 id="h2717525"><a id=""></a><strong>Why Luan weapons are better than Grade 7 weapons in practice</strong></h2><p><strong>Getting a maxed Grade 7 weapon involves a huge grind</strong>. For reference, even after completing <em>everything </em>in the game, I didn’t get a single Grade 7 weapon past +40 with the drops I naturally acquired. Conversely, many Luan weapons aren’t even locked behind especially hard postgame challenges. For example, the Lurking Luan sword is locked behind the “Final Battle against the Yellow Turbans” mission in Chapter 1, and I completed this challenge with time to spare even though I was several levels below the recommended level 71.</p><p>By the time I reached max level through naturally completing Ultimate Warrior missions, I had <em>ample </em>power to defeat anything and everything the game could throw at me. Taking the time to grind out maxed Grade 7 weapons would have been total overkill.</p><figure id="" data-id="7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-recommend-id="image://7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screenshot of the Weapon Reforge menu from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Grade 7 weapon Celestial Sword +23 is highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2717526"><a id=""></a><strong>The best way to get the Deadly Perfection achievement</strong></h2><p>Still, you don’t want to ignore weapon forging completely. The Deadly Perfection achievement is unlocked by fully upgrading a weapon, so you can’t miss this if you want 100 percent completion. Fortunately, as long as you’re not gunning for a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon, this one is pretty easy.</p><p><strong>To easily get Deadly Perfection, just save your game and spend all your money on upgrading any weapon Grade 6 or lower</strong>. Since you can find and outright purchase weapons with +20 modifiers already on them, this is significantly easier to grind out as long as you have the cash. In fact, a +99 Grade 6 weapon will perform about on par with a +13 Grade 7 weapon, so you could choose to use one if you’re starting Ultimate Warrior. But if you’d rather save your cash, you can reload your game after getting your trophy.</p><p>To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with wanting a fully upgrade Grade 7 weapon! If you’re down for the grind, it’ll certainly make the rest of your postgame challenge easier. But if you’d rather save your time, you’re not missing much.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You and a squad can channel your inner repo man in 2025’s hit horror spectacle. REPO encourages groups of players to form, forage, and flee, and if it’s free and costs nothing, it would be all the more sweet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> started strongly, instantly gaining a few thousand players daily thanks to its advertised brand of silliness and scares. Within days, its community had exploded, achieving over a hundred thousand players and counting. You can’t help but laugh at REPO—before you inevitably shriek—and the addictive gameplay loop means replayability and longevity aren’t an issue.</p>



<p>More and more players are keen to get involved, and a low-cost entry point (potentially free) could be massive for its long-term success.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-repo-on-steam">How Much is REPO on Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more piece of loot. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO costs $9.99 or £8.50 on Steam—the horror title isn’t free to play.</strong></p>



<p>Low-budget indie titles from growing studios are unlikely to make a project free-to-play. The company needs to make money, especially if it isn’t reliant on a microtransaction-driven economy. A $9.99 or £8.50 price tag is great value for what you get with REPO.</p>



<p>We’ve highlighted Steam as REPO is only available on PC for now. A future port can’t be ruled out, but there’s currently no talk of it coming to consoles. Never say never, and if it blows up enough, a future port can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>There’s already a stellar amount of content in the game. What’s more is developer semiwork is blown away by the game’s success and is not content to sit around and leave players to grow tired of the existing features.</p>



<h2 id="h-future-repo-content-roadmap">Future REPO Content Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>New enemies, levels, general content, and bug fixes are on the way in REPO.</strong></p>



<p>“Hey everyone, thank you so much for playing R.E.P.O. we are completely shocked and overjoyed with the response! Here’s a video with an update on what we are up to! We plan to release a video every week to make sure you guys are all up to date with our plans!” said the developer on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/515203741912138911?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">March 7 Steam post</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you have paid for REPO, or you’re planning on it, this is a great time to invest in the hit indie title.</p>



<hr>



<p>Many indie titles enjoy a hot start, and the hype and excitement dip. But Among Us shows that a squirrel finds a nut (or a gun) from time to time. It’ll be fascinating to see if REPO can stand the test of time in 2025—do you hope it can sustain its success?</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has commented further on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023, stating: "I couldn't allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn't agree with".</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html">Game*Spark</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideki-kamiya-wants-his-new-studio-to-inherit-the-teachings-of-resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami/">Automaton</a>), the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> creator discussed his new studio Clovers and disputed its similarity to Capcom's now-defunct Clover Studio (where he worked on Okami and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viewtiful-joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>) is not him "clinging to the past".</p>
<p>"If there's anything I'm particular about, it's Capcom Production Studio 4," he said. "Studio 4 is where my career started, and where I learned from Shinji Mikami - a person who has been absolutely indispensable to my career, both as a creator and as my superior."</p>

<p>Mikami led Production Studio 4, which was responsible for many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and many more.</p>
<p>"Back then, we used to call what Mikami taught us the 'spirit of the 4th'," said Kamiya. "The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company's way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn't place importance on the creators' individuality."</p>
<p>He added: "Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn't allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn't agree with."</p>
<p>Kamiya is a particularly outspoken figure in the games industry, but his output certainly has a unique and distinctive flair: from the stylish action of Devil May Cry and flamboyance of Bayonetta, to the unique visuals of Okami and Viewtiful Joe.</p>
<p>That spirit of "the creators' individuality" is also particularly apparent in, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">forthcoming Death Stranding 2</a>. Where the industry contains plenty of copycat games and sequels, Kamiya's comments highlight the importance of creating fresh experiences.</p>
<p>Another Kamiya example would be the cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, which Kamiya worked on at PlatinumGames with Microsoft. The action game focused on a human protagonist with headphones and a smartphone in a fantasy world with a sidekick dragon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-resurrect-the-cancelled-scalebound">Kamiya recently stated his interest in resurrecting the project</a>, with a direct callout to Xbox boss Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Kamiya also took a cheeky stab at his former employer in a video on his YouTube channel. It features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-loses-more-game-directors-reveals-former-vice-president-hideki-kamiya">number of prominent developers from PlatinumGames who have recently left</a> all having a drinking party.</p>
<p>Clovers, Kamiya's new studio, is working on a sequel to Okami. The announcement had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">Kamiya "crying with the fans"</a>.</p>
<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">working with Microsoft on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microtransactions have been added to EA's free-to-play Skate revival during the game's closed alpha test.</p>
<p>Skate's in-game currency is known as San Van Bucks, and allows players to buy various cosmetic items. As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/">Insider Gaming</a>, developer Full Circle said this is being added to give players a "positive experience when purchasing items from the Skate store".</p>

<p>A message to Skate's playtesters reads: "To ensure we achieve these goals at Early Access we have enabled the option to purchase and use virtual currency (San Van Bucks) in our ongoing Closed Alpha playtest.</p>
<p>"Your feedback will be greatly appreciated in providing a great experience at Early Access launch."</p>
<p>The developer has told players that any purchases made during the test will be converted back to San Van Bucks prior to the game's early access launch. The currency will be made available again at the start of Skate's early access, but players must ensure they use the same EA account.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">Five years after it was first announced</a>, Skate will launch in early access later this year, although EA is yet to give us a specific date.</p>
<p>On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

In other skateboarding-related news, earlier this month Activision announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were finally getting the remake treatment</a>.

            <p>Two voice actors working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> have been suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes.</p>
<p>Emeri Chase, who played Soldier 11, announced they were replaced as they were "unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protections".</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has also been recast despite not being a member of the union. Both actors only found out about the recasting at the same time as players, when details of <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/37341958">Zenless Zone Zero's latest patch</a> went live.</p>

<p>Chase posted a thread on social media to explain the situation.</p>
<p>"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," they said. "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck'. But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p>
<p>"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the Union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love.</p>
<p>"I knew that by withholding work it was possible I'd be replaced, though of course I hoped they would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return. I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you."</p>

I was replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry.

Any other theories that pop up are incorrect.

</span></p><p>Eurogamer has contacted HoYoverse for further comment.</p>
<p>Today, Eurogamer reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">strike from US actors' union SAG-AFTRA remains ongoing</a> as it warns of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse" in the latest proposal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike began back in July last year</a>, with the main sticking point being the need to protect actors from AI abuse.</p>
<p>While some actors are still working despite the strike, Chase and Thurkettle's situation is a clear example of the risk actors are taking to protect their livelihoods as the dispute continues.</p>
<p>Today the union urged performers to "seriously consider the consequences" of working with game producers at this time, not only in undermining the strike but opening performers to AI misuse.</p>
<p>In related news, HoYoverse announced actor Showtaro Morikubo will no longer voice Ifa in the Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Genshin_7/status/1899664144800080249">social media announcement</a>, the company stated "due to various circumstances" the actors has "been forced to withdraw from the project".</p>

The book likens the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghur to the suppression and genocide of Jewish people by the Nazi party.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Netflix's first gaming boss has left the company, following a shift in role and various changes behind the scenes last year.
</p>
<p>
Mike Verdu launched and led Netflix's gaming efforts in 2021, but was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">moved to a new role - VP of Generative AI for games at Netflix</a> - in November last year. At the time, Verdu said peers should "pay no mind to uninformed speculation in the media about changes at Netflix Games", as the changes were a "planned transition".
</p>
<p>
Now, Verdu has departed the company entirely, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc">Game File</a> has reported.
</p>
<p>
The move follows a number of shifts behind the scenes last year, including the hiring of gaming industry veteran Alain Tascan to serve as Verdu's replacement as gaming boss.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten, and scrapped its big-budget project before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
By January, <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Netflix had reportedly dropped at least six other game projects</a> it was planning to publish - including cosy Hobbit sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which will now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-yet-again">launch at a later date without the streaming company's involvement</a>.
</p>
<p>
And in February this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Netflix cut staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>. No announcement was made on how many jobs were lost, or what the studio was working on next.
</p>
<p>
As Netflix reorganises its plans, it remains unclear how its gaming focus will look going forward - other than Verdu will not be part of it.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">increasing its prices yet again</a>, including here in the UK.

"Management did not inform public about these steps either," Krúpa claimed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft issued the following statement to IGN:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we mentioned during our Q3 sales, the review of various transformational strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing. The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises for all stakeholders. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?srnd=undefined" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent were in discussions to take the company private following a number of high-profile flops, game cancellations, and the collapse of the company's share price. At the time, the talks were merely exploratory, and Ubisoft told IGN it would "inform the market if and when appropriate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For several years now, Ubisoft has seemed to be in a strange, slow downward spiral, with a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">high-profile flops</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">layoffs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">studio closures</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">game cancellations, and delay after delay after delay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, rumors continue to spin about what exact proposals the board is considering, with some media outlets floating the idea that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tencent is increasingly reluctant to embrace Ubisoft</a> due to the Guillemot family's insistance on retaining a significant amount of control. Sans Tencent, there are few other companies big enough and rich enough to spend the cash needed to save the albatross Ubisoft has grown into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Management postponed its current game (which should save the company and its financials) Assassin’s Creed first time on 18th of July 2024," Krúpa's statement said. "On that date, Ubisoft confirmed full-year guidance for the year and release of AC Shadows on November 15. 2024. Just [a] couple months later, in September 2024, Ubisoft delayed the game again and revised its guidance, which in our view, was [a] move that could have [been] predicted by Ubisoft management. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After [the] third delay, the game will finally be published on March 20, 2025. These delays and revised guidances caused severe stock declines, which harmed mostly retail investors that have limited resources to manage their positions accordingly. This action benefited mainly corporate and institutional investors who were on the buy side for distressed prices such as Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs clients, Morgan Stanley, and others."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Believing management did not communicate with shareholders "appropriately," AJ Investments is calling on all investors "who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft's stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team" to join its protest in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are aware that Ubisoft’s management and CEO have initiated a financial review of potential strategic options, advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. We expect this review to yield results in the coming months,” said Juraj Krúpa, founder of AJ Investments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why we are organizing this demonstration in May — to ensure they have time to reach a conclusion that genuinely increases shareholder value. If their conclusion effectively enhances shareholder value, we will call off the demonstration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All shareholders/investors of Ubisoft deserve a company that maximizes value and operates with transparency and accountability,” Krúpa added. “Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AJ Investors said that it is prepared to "sue the company for misleading investors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time this investor has called for the company to go private amid a shares slump following the disappointing release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump"><u>AJ Investments issued a strongly worded open letter to Ubisoft’s board of directors</u></a>, including its CEO Yves Guillemot, as well as fellow investor Tencent, to express their dissatisfaction with the performance of the company and its current share price and urging the firm to change its leadership and consider a sale. It followed weeks of turmoil at Ubisoft, where the megacorp's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales"><u>share price plunged following the launch of Massive Entertainment’s Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>, which Ubisoft subsequently confirmed had performed below expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <p>
Lego is working to build up its in-house game development, the company's boss has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf">The Financial Times</a>, Lego boss Niels Christiansen said the company was increasing its focus on video game experiences created by its own teams, following years of partnerships with outside companies. 
</p>
<p>
"We can definitely say, as long as we're under the Lego brand, we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical," Christiansen said. "[In-house game development] is something we're building up. We have made quite a few investments in the future – I'd almost rather overinvest. That's the benefit of being family-owned and long term."
</p>
<p>
For over a decade, Lego games were mostly made by British studio TT Games, with a popular tie-in to a big movie franchise released every year.
</p>
<p>
For 15 years, TT Games pumped out dozens of annual Lego games with a familiar formula, based on Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC characters. It also mounted the ambitious toys-to-life effort <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But that era of Lego gaming is largely over, with only one entry - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> - in the past six years. TT Games is reportedly still working on a further title, but it is not expected in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Lego has licensed its brand to a wider set of developers - most notably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, co-developed by Guerilla Games and published by Sony. Fortnite now has a deep integration with Lego, with minifigure versions of most of its digital skins, two large Lego game modes, and countless mini-games made by Lego itself and fans.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, now rebranded to Lego Fortnite Odyssey, is a Minecraft-y offering regularly played by around 50,000 people concurrently within the main Fortnite client. Last December, the company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">launched Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, a gentle life sim and house decoration game, to a smaller audience.
</p>
<p>
For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-lego-horror-cheerful-games-and-others-we-just-cant-get-into">The Lego Group has a small team of designers building and launching game concepts within Fortnite</a>, which now has an impressive replication of Lego bricks and physics baked into Epic's Unreal Engine. It'll be interesting to see what's next, as the wait for TT Games' next old-school Lego game continues.
</p>
<p>"I hope it will never be done," head of Lego gaming at The Lego Group Remi Marcelli told Eurogamer last year, of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-lego-fortnite-i-hope-it-will-never-be-done">the company's big Fortnite mode, which continues to expand</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With just about two weeks before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a>, UK developer Rebellion has shared the minimum system requirements needed to play the game's PC version. They're not too different from what we see nowadays, though the good news is that the game (powered as usual by Rebellion's proprietary Asura engine) won't occupy too much space on your drive.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 or later</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel CPU Core i5-9400f or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia 2060 6GB or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;60 GB available space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a fresh features trailer out today, too, and you can watch it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Features Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k1QT6gM5wY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is being labeled as Rebellion's take on Fallout, although it is more of a survival action game than a roleplaying game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic British countryside landscape heavily inspired by the real-life Windscale Fire disaster of the 1950s in England, unfolding in a quarantined environment where players must uncover the mysteries of a nuclear disaster while surviving in a militarized zone. The setting includes inspirations from the likes of Doctor Who and even folk horror.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Atomfall will let players explore a non-linear world filled with complex characters and ambiguous moral dilemmas. The story will also change depending on the player's decisions. This design was crafted to encourage multiple playthroughs, with players experiencing different facets of the game based on their choices.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself won't be about running and gunning. Players will have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out of the quarantined zone. Weapons and ammunition are in short supply, so each frenetic battle will see them forced to mix ranged with hand-to-hand combat. In a nod to Rebellion's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-resistance-sniping-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite series</a>, players will have to manage their character's heart rate to maintain a steady aim.</p>
<p>Atomfall will launch on March 27 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though the Deluxe Edition provides three days of early access as well as a few in-game items and access to an upcoming expansion. The game will be available on release day for all Game Pass subscribers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Hazelight Studios <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that their latest game, Split Fiction, has already sold over a million copies in just two days since its debut on the market. The immense popularity of the studio's previous release, the award-winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a> (which sold 23 million copies, over twice as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Way Out</a>'s 11 million units), certainly contributed to the great hype surrounding the latest co-op adventure crafted by Josef Fares and his team.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/developer/Hazelight+Studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam figures</a>. While A Way Out peaked at just 8.5K concurrent users and It Takes Two reached 71K concurrent users, Split Fiction registered 259K concurrent users three days ago, with the potential to set a new record this coming weekend.</p>
<p>The game also got a warm reception from critics overall, as evidenced by the 91 average Metacritic score. Our Nathan Birch was slightly less enthusiastic about it, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving it an 8 out of 10 score</a>.</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Are you enjoying Hazelight's new game so far?</p>
<p>In other news, Josef Fares recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his opinion</a> on the damage that the microtransaction business model deals to developer creativity.</p>
