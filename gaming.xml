			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features a lot of powerful Orphan enemies to defeat, but for the vast majority of them, accurate headshots with any weapon are more than enough to take them down with relative ease. This is not the case for the most powerful Orphans and those who manage to consume multiple bodies, which are easily recognizable by a peculiar trait: <strong>most of their body is covered in tentacles</strong>, making them look as if they are wearing a suit of armor. Besides making them look markedly different from any other Orphan, <strong>this sort of armor made of tentacles makes them more difficult to take down</strong>. If you try shooting at any part covered in tentacles, you will notice that your shots will <strong>bounce off.</strong> As such, you will have either have to <strong>deal with the tentacle armor first, or completely change your combat approach.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting canisters to set enemies on fire and weaken them is one of the core gameplay mechanics in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lowering the extreme defenses these Cronos: The New Dawn enemies have is not too difficult, if you have the right resources or if you are in the right place, as <strong>setting them on fire will leave them defenseless for a short while</strong>. To do so, you will either have to use the flamethrower, a Pyre bomb, or shoot canisters and the like if any are nearby. If you are in a bind, this is also the easiest way to deal with these armored enemies, as you won't need to do any accurate shooting to damage them once you set them on fire.</p>



<p>If you have no means to set these armored Orphans on fire, you can still take them down with a bit of effort. Although the tentacle armor seems impenetrable,<strong> it always leaves some parts of their bodies exposed</strong>, usually one of their arms, so if you focus your shots on these parts, you can take them down without setting them on fire. As these enemies have a lot of health, you'd better use a weapon with high firepower like any shotgun, otherwise you risk prolonging the fight too much and wasting precious ammo for the handgun, which you should save for weaker enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 shows no signs of slowing down, with releases coming thick and fast, with the new Dust Devils Premium Warbond now available—but is it worth it?</p>



<p>After the long-awaited Xbox launch last week, which coincided with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST Legendary Warbond</a>, a fresh update has brought a wealth of new challenges. Whether you’re taking down the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-hive-lord-hp-best-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hive Lord</a>, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-destroy-spore-lung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destroying Spore Lungs</a>, new gear will not go amiss.</p>



<p>We’ve got all the details on the Dust Devils Premium Warbond here, including a breakdown of what’s included and whether it’s worth spending your hard-earned Super Credits on.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond">How Much is The Dust Devils Premium Warbond?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of gear. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 costs 1,000 Super Credits, the standard price of Warbonds in the game.</strong></p>



<p>This translates to $9.99 in real-world money, though you don’t need to spend at all, as Super Credits can be farmed in the game. You can also use a Warbond Token to unlock the full pass.</p>



<p>As usual with Warbonds in Helldivers 2, there is no limited-time period to make the purchase, and it will remain available permanently, so you can purchase it whenever you like.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-helldivers-2-dust-devils-premium-warbond">All Rewards in the Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Premium Warbond</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Warbond in Helldivers 2 has a total of 22 rewards to claim, including two armor sets, three Stratagems, and a new assault rifle.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards in the Dust Devils Warbond are geared around the latest content drop, introducing Hive planets, providing effective firepower to take down the threats they pose, along with accompanying cosmetics.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of every reward in the Dust Devils Warbond below, including the Medals required to unlock them.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Reward</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Medals Required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">30</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Hellpod</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-42 Federation’s Blade</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rightful Occupier</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AR-2 Coyote</td><td data-align="center">Assault Rifle</td><td data-align="center">35</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Speargun</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Helmet</td><td data-align="center">45</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DS-191 Scorpion</td><td data-align="center">Armor</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td><td data-align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Windswept Wayfarer</td><td data-align="center">Cape</td><td data-align="center">25</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Shuttle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Expendable Napalm</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">85</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Solo Silo</td><td data-align="center">Stratagem</td><td data-align="center">110</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Raider’s Cheer</td><td data-align="center">Emoted</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Exosuit</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Super Credits</td><td data-align="center">Bonus</td><td data-align="center">32</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rattlesnake Vehicle</td><td data-align="center">Pattern</td><td data-align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">G-7 Pineapple</td><td data-align="center">Throwable</td><td data-align="center">65</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burier of Heads</td><td data-align="center">title</td><td data-align="center">20</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dust-devils-premium-warbond-worth-it">Is the Dust Devils Premium Warbond Worth it?</h2>



<p><strong>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2 is definitely worth purchasing for additional firepower to take down the Hive Worlds introduced in the Into The Unjust update.</strong></p>



<p>With missions on the Hive planets taking you deep underground, where your Stratagems are ineffective unless you manage to find an opening in the tunnel system, the weapons included in the Dust Devils Warbond are the perfect tools for the job.</p>



<p>The AR-2 Coyote assault rifle is ideal for mowing through the Terminid hordes, with the incendiary ammunition packing a punch, and the G-7 Pineapple cluster frag grenade is similarly effective for taking out large groups of enemies.</p>



<p>Both pale in comparison with the EAT-700 Expendable Napalm, a single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs, and the MS-11 Solo Silo, which calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote—though the latter may require being outside of the cave system.</p>



<p>The Dust Devils Warbond is a worthwhile addition for any Helldiver, though it’s particularly useful for any new Xbox players who perhaps don’t have an arsenal as expansive as their PC and PlayStation counterparts just yet.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> CEO Hakan Abrak has commented on the disastrous launch of Build A Rocket Boy's action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> back in June, stating it wasn't what the company hoped for.
</p>
<p>
IOI provided assistance distributing the game through its IOI Partners publishing arm. Now, at a recent event for the company's forthcoming Bond game, Abrak spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a> about MindsEye's launch.
</p>
<p>
"The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them," said Abrak. "We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they'll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game."

<p>
"Well, that was definitely tough, right?," Abrak continued, speaking of the launch itself. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners. They're working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they're working on. So hopefully they'll succeed with that in the future."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the game's release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">co-CEO of Build A Rocket Boy suggested negative reaction to MindsEye had been paid for</a> in a "concerted effort" against the studio. At the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">Abrak stated</a>: "I don't believe that."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Two studio execs departed the studio</a> just one week before it debuted and then, once released, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">clear MindsEye was full of technical issues</a>. The studio promised performance updates, but later a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content">Hitman crossover mission was delayed by IO Interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, has the Hitman and Bond studio been too burned by its work with Build A Rocket Boy to continue with similar publishing work?
</p>
<p>
"So, IO Interactive will publish our own games internally," said Abrak. "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">MindsEye received a one star review from Eurogamer</a>. "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat," it reads.

<p>Now, there's no eShop page currently live, nor are there any pre-order options for this one, so if you want to dive into the hotly anticipated sequel as early as you possibly can, you'll want to be there at drop time. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry revealed the release times in a handful of regions, but we thought it was only right to recap 'em all for you now, so you don't miss out on any valuable metroidvania minutes. You'll find the exact time Silksong launches in your region below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jinzmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game will set you back <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> (there's no GBP price info available at the time of writing, but we have to imagine it'll be £19.99 too), and there's even a free upgrade path to the Switch 2 version of the game if you decide to pick up the S1 edition today.</p>
<p>And we'll be diving right in with you. Team Cherry confirmed that it wouldn't be sending our pre-launch codes, so we'll be setting out on our underground adventure today and will endeavour to have our review with you as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>Valve has trademarked the term Steam Frame, lending fuel to rumors that the company is planning to release a console counterpart to its popular handheld Steam Deck. No matter what form the Steam Frame takes, it looks like Valve is planning to expand its gaming hardware offerings in the near future.</p><p>Valve filed two separate trademarks for the Steam Frame on September 2, as spotted by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n7ojk1/steam_frame_trademarked_by_valve_computer_hardware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user</a>, with each covering a different use.

<p>While the trademark filing doesn't have enough information to confirm anything, the industry rumor mill suggests Valve is working on multiple hardware projects including a Steam console codenamed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fremont</a>, a new SteamVR headset codenamed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deckard</a>, and new Steam controllers. The Valve Fremont <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently appeared</a> in a listing on benchmarking platform Geekbench, further fueling speculation around the project.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machines-first-impressions-the-specs-prices-/1100-6425734/" data-ref-id="1100-6425734">Steam Machine</a>, Valve's first foray into compact gaming hardware running the Linux-based SteamOS, was a flop, the company has had better luck with recent releases including the popular handheld Steam Deck. Many have speculated that Valve would return to console-like hardware for SteamOS after the Steam Deck's success, and recent news is making a console announcement look more likely.</p><p>As for what exactly the Steam Frame will be, the multiple trademarks suggest the branding could be intended to cover multiple upcoming hardware devices, as well as their related peripherals.</p>

                <p>Prior to this year, the release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 console was the subject of numerous rumors and speculative reports. The wait for fans officially ended in early June, but a new report states that Nintendo pushed back the Switch 2 launch multiple times despite the frustration of third-party companies.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the reason Nintendo didn't rush Switch 2 to the market is because its designers requested extended deadlines for the launch titles in order to "perfect" them. Nintendo prioritized that above all other concerns, including the third-party publishers and fans who clamored for the console for years.</p><p>Earlier this summer, a separate report noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-dev-kits-still-sound-somewhat-rare-even-2-months-after-launch-report/1100-6534247/" data-ref-id="1100-6534247">Switch 2 development kits are still rare among third-party</a> companies even months after launch. It's believed that issue may be the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/" data-ref-id="1100-6533186">why some Switch 2 third-party titles have yet to be officially announced</a>. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-developer-claims-that-sales-were-below-our-lowest-estimates/1100-6532572/" data-ref-id="1100-6532572">Switch 2 launch titles have also outsold the third-party games</a> for the console by a much higher ratio than expected.</p><p>Nintendo released a statement last month that said it regrets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-regrets-the-inconvenience-of-switch-2-selling-out-all-the-time/1100-6533634/" data-ref-id="1100-6533634">the inconvenience caused by Switch 2's scarcity</a>. The company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 sold over 6 million units</a> by the first week of August, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">has reportedly moved 2 million consoles</a> in North America alone.</p><p>For now, Switch 2 is the only major modern console that hasn't been hit by a price hike over tariffs. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">that may change in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo recently released an update for Switch Online, which among other little tweaks adds a nice, nostalgia infused Easter egg to the Game Boy Advance app.</p>
<p>This Easter egg can be found by twiddling with the analogue stick while booting up the Game Boy Advance app. If you do this, you will be met with the classic GBA bootup sequence.</p>
<p>You can see how the Easter egg looks via the video I took this morning.</p> <div>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers have confirmed plans to introduce Placement Matches to the ranked mode for new seasons, though there is no details on exactly when it will release.</p>



<p>Since its launch in December 2024, Marvel Rivals’ ranked set-up has attracted criticism from players, particularly at the start of new seasons when things reset, as higher-ranked players drop several tiers.</p>



<p>This has made the first few days of a new season in ranked incredibly unbalanced, a frustrating experience for players, but devs have been listening to feedback and announced plans to bring placement matches into the fray.</p>

<p>Announced at the end of the latest <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963300965437538535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dev Vision video</a> ahead of the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 on September 12</a>, Marvel Rivals devs acknowledged the discussions in the community on the back of the recently released details explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-explain-matchmaking-system-after-player-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the matchmaking system works</a>.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that the team is “already working on implementing Placement Matches,” but, as it is a “complex feature with a lot of moving parts,” the team needs “more time for development and thorough testing.”</p>



<p>While Placement Matches won’t be ready for the drop of Season 4, the team is “pushing forward as quickly as we can.”</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Placement Matches will be a major feature that drops as part of Season 5, which is expected to launch in early November. Exact details of the Season 5 launch are not known, though the start date should be revealed by the Season 4 Battle Pass.</p>

            <p>Amazon has cast Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Turner, known to many as Game of Thrones' Sansa Stark, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series">rumoured to be in talks to play Lara Croft in November last year</a>. She will follow in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander, who both previously portrayed the globetrotting archeologist in live-action Tomb Raider adaptations. </p>

<p>As previously reported, Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>
<p>"I'm so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p><p>Turner added she was "thrilled beyond measure" to be playing Lara Croft. "She's such an iconic character, who means so much to so many - and I am giving everything I've got," the actor said. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking."</p>
<p>Amazon has confirmed production on the series will officially begin next year, on 19th January. Joining Waller-Bridge and Turner on the series are Jonathan Van Tulleken as director and executive producer, as well as Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider TV series - which Amazon has previously referred to as "epic" - doesn't have a release date yet, but will air on Prime Video when it eventually shows up.</p>

Details have remained fairly sparse for the upcoming Tomb Raider since it was announced.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-on-xbox-sells-a-lot-more-than-gears-of-war-reloaded-on-playstation.1288389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft and Sony performed a rather unusual (especially on Sony's side) shooter game exclusive exchange on August 26, when Helldivers 2 launched on Xbox Series S and X and Gears of War Reloaded brought the series to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Whereas the latter game is certainly not the only Xbox title available on Sony's console following the policy switch to full-on multiplatform, Helldivers 2 is a unicum that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. There was a lot of demand for it, though, what with the Xbox crowd always having been shooter-friendly, and the fact that a live service always benefits from being on as many platforms as possible.</p>



<p>Now that it's been a little over a week since these launches, game analyst (and Wccftech friend) Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how each release has performed so far. Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2 turned out to be a lot more popular on Xbox than Gears of War Reloaded on PlayStation 5. According to the data gathered by the analytics firm, the remaster of the first title in the Gears of War series only sold around 259K units on PS5, whereas Arrowhead's hectic sci-fi cooperative game about squashing alien bugs is already nearing the million with 926K units. Helldivers 2 even outsold itself on PlayStation 5: back when it launched on Sony's console, the game sold around 633K units in the first six days. </p>



<p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, we know the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has surpassed one million players</a>. Alinea Analytics says it has reached 1.3 million at this point, but a million of those were from Xbox, despite those users knowing the game all too well. Most of those players likely accessed it from Game Pass, too. The PC userbase is really minuscule: around 41K players, per this data.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War Reloaded also performed poorly compared to Forza Horizon 5, which sold nearly six times as many copies on PS5 in the same timeframe. Granted, perhaps it is not entirely fair to compare a remaster of a 19-year-old game to two much more recent games that are still among the hottest titles of the respective genres. </p>



<p>Alinea Analytics also shared more highlights from August 2025's hottest games. Peak remained the most downloaded with 4 million downloads, but Delta Force was close behind it with 3.7 million downloads, owing to the recent console launch and a resurgence on Steam as well. Grounded 2 secured the third place with 2.2 million downloads. </p>



<p>When it comes to premium games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has sold over 1.2 million units at this point, half of which on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is at 500K units, though it's still early days given that it debuted exactly a week ago.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-fallout-dlcs-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-fallout-dlcs-ranked%E2%80%94which-fallout-expansion-is-the-best.1288362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If there’s one thing Bethesda Game Studios does well, it’s the creation of a top-notch expansion. For the Fallout franchise, some sizeable expansions have dropped over the years that have left players impressed and hungry for more. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios has delivered some great additional content. In this list, we’re taking a look at the 10 best Fallout DLCs and ranking them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-best-fallout-dlc-ever">What’s The Best Fallout DLC Ever?</h2>



<p>Everyone has their idea of the perfect expansion. It’s a mostly subjective argument, but there are some universal truths. If you disagree with this list of the best Fallout DLCs ranked, then be sure to leave a comment and set us straight!</p>



<h3 id="h-best-nuka-world-fallout-4">Best: Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-World was a fantastic adventure from start to finish, taking players to a wide, open theme park that could be made operational. It was the perfect endgame DLC to an already impressive base game, and it served as a sublime send-off to the best-selling core Fallout game ever released. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-point-lookout-fallout-3">2. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout was a creepy, backwoods expansion that forced players to contend with some of Fallout 3’s eeriest enemies. It was a darker, more foreboding expansion that took players out of the base game’s map and put them in the heart of a swamp bursting at the seams with danger.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/">10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-3-far-harbor-fallout-4">3. Far Harbor (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Behind Nuka-World, Far Harbor was a fantastic expansion for Fallout 4, and in many ways, it was similar to Point Lookout from Fallout 3. It introduced players to a brilliant map that was a wonder to explore, and the only thing holding this particular Fallout DLC back from the top spot is the series of annoying puzzles that must be solved as part of the expansion. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-the-pitt-fallout-3">4. The Pitt (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Pitt was so good that Bethesda Game Studios decided to revisit it in Fallout 76 more than a decade later. It was one of the grittier Fallout expansions, landing players in the heart of Pittsburgh to go toe-to-toe against savage, mutated creatures that were once slaves, twisted up by their masters and the environment around them.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-lonesome-road-fallout-new-vegas">5. Lonesome Road (Fallout New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fallout: New Vegas had some fantastic expansions, but few are as memorable as Lonesome Road. It’s one of the best Fallout DLCs because of the writing behind it and the characters it introduces – namely, Ulysses. It expands beautifully on the protagonist’s backstory and gives players a great location to explore,but  it’s just a little light on content.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-broken-steel-fallout-3">6. Broken Steel (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Broken Steel was one of the best Fallout DLCs that was released to appease fans who wanted more of the base game. It boosted the game’s level cap, added a stack of new content, and introduced an extra act that saw players fight the Enclave directly alongside the Brotherhood of Steel – Liberty Prime included. It was a bit of an afterthought that Bethesda created to ‘give players a little more’, but it was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-7-automatron-fallout-4">7. Automatron (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Automatron was a short but sweet Fallout DLC that saw players pick up the ability to solve a mechanical mystery and create a robot companion that could be anything they so desired. It was the first outing for the expansion concept in Fallout 4, and while it didn’t add too much, it was entertaining enough for a couple of hours’ worth of content.</p>



<h3>8. Vault-Tec Workshop (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Vault-Tec Workshop, players get access to their own customisable Vault. It’s a massive, underground cavern with untold potential to craft something truly unique, but that’s about all it is – a building expansion. There are a few experiments to carry out, in true Vault-Tec style, but ultimately, it’s an expansion that allows you to build a Vault, which is about it.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-honest-hearts-fallout-3">9. Honest Hearts (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Honest Hearts has been the subject of many memes over the years, most notably because of the character that’s introduced in it – The Burned Man, Joshua Graham. It’s a great narrative, but the expanded area that’s opened up for exploration isn’t all that memorable, and aside from the core story, there isn’t much to unravel.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-steel-reign-fallout-76">10. Steel Reign (Fallout 76)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Steel Reign was one of the more sizeable Fallout 76 expansions – more commonly known as ‘updates’ – that brought the Brotherhood of Steel back into play. It was a follow-on from Steel Dawn, which was released around a year prior, and it added plenty of story content for the player to enjoy – but since it dropped in 2021, Bethesda Game Studios hasn’t been back to revisit the Brotherhood storyline. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-like-hitman/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-007-first-light-like-hitman-io-interactive-development-explained.1288353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Is 007 First Light like Hitman from a gameplay standpoint? That’s a common question from anyone who hears IO Interactive is making the jump to James Bond.</p>



<p>Millions of people fell in love with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-75-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hitman: World of Assassination trilogy</a> over the last decade. During that time, Agent 47 had an established formula that was consistently refined with interesting maps and engaging challenges.</p>



<p>James Bond has quite an interesting history when it comes to video games, but what can you expect in the newest game? Is 007 First Light like Hitman?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-gameplay-similar-to-hitman">Is 007 First Light Gameplay Similar to Hitman?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He may be another spy, but James Bond is not Agent 47. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>007 First Light can be compared to Hitman and shares some of its mechanics and stylings, but it’s not an exact copy and is its own game.</strong></p>



<p>A lot of the things that connect Hitman and First Light are the exploration aspects of the game. When things are calm, James Bond will survey his environment and look for ways to sneak around and enter restricted areas by causing distractions or using gadgets to disorient enemies. That is very similar to how Agent 47 operates in Hitman, so the blueprints align there, though we haven’t seen James try to steal someone’s outfit like 47 often does.</p>



<p>We would say where the two differ the most is in the combat. In Hitman, the focus was very much on remaining stealthy as long as possible. Agent 47 can fight his way out of a tricky situation, but those moments are rather limiting. Shooting in the Hitman games is rather stiff, and his melee is basic at best.</p>



<p><a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">007 First Light</a> seems to have gotten a big facelift when it comes to combat. Bond can do more with the environment around him when fighting, like grab an enemy and throw them in a direction, or fight to take a weapon away from someone. We’ve also seen Bond control an airplane and make it rock sideways while in combat, so there could be bigger ways to give enemies a harder time taking you out.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-has-more-to-it-than-stealth-and-combat">007 First Light Has More to It Than Stealth and Combat</h2>



<p>For the Hitman games, stealth and combat are essentially the main things you have to look forward to. There is a story there, but to be honest, it’s nothing that special or interesting.</p>



<p>IO Interactive is putting in the work to make 007 First Light a more cinematic experience than Hitman. Consider the car driving sections that never appeared in Hitman, or just how much more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-james-bond-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Bond is willing to talk</a> to get his way. We love Agent 47, but the point of his character is to be silent and stoic.</p>



<p>From the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early look we’ve had at the game</a>, 007 First Light definitely appears to have some of the Hitman DNA in it, but we would say it’s been built on top of not necessarily making something completely new, but augmenting what came before so that James Bond can stand apart from Agent 47.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you love the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy? How are you feeling now that IO Interactive is focused on James Bond instead of Agent 47? Let us know in the comments or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

If you want to go the extra step, consider a very <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive collector’s edition</a>.</p>

It also supports online play, so players can play against users across the country and compete in the online leaderboards.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Realistic Escape Action Just Like the TV Show</strong></p><p>The game flow is as follows: Runners get a head start to escape, and Hunters are released 30 seconds later. Runners accumulate prize money based on the amount of time they spend escaping, and can of course surrender at any point to keep the prize money accumulated thus far. If the Runners can avoid being captured by a Hunter within the 15-minute time limit, they have successfully escaped. But if a Runner is captured by a Hunter, it is “Game Over!” Can you escape the Hunters until the very end?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Become the Hunter in Hunter Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunter Mode,” which puts players in control of a Hunter, is included for the first time in the series. Players have always dreamed of becoming a Hunter and chasing down and capturing Runners, and now it is finally possible. Become a Hunter, capture Runners, and aim to be the greatest Hunter. Updated Hunters will also appear.</p><p><strong>A Series First: Hunters vs. Runners Mode</strong></p><p>“Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” in which players can choose to play as either a Hunter or Runner, is included for the first time in the series. In order to stop the rampaging Hunters, who have lost control of their power, the Runners must launch a counterattack against the Hunters using weapons obtained in missions. In “Online VS,” up to 12 users can play together (four Hunters, eight Runners). Who will come out on top between the Hyper Hunters Army and the Runners?</p><p><strong>A Series First: Online VS</strong></p><p>Includes an “Online VS” feature that allows up to 12 players to compete for the first time in the series. Users can compete online via quick and simple matchmaking, or play against friends. All five “Runners Mode” and “Hunters vs. Runners Mode” stages can be played online.</p><p><strong>Compete Against Players Across the Country in the Online Leaderboards</strong></p><p>In “Hunter Mode,” your ranking is determined by your score based on how fast you clear the stage. In “Hunters vs. Runners Mode,” your ranking is determined by the total prize money accumulated playing both offline and online.</p><p><strong>High-Variety Game-Original Stages</strong></p><p>The battle stages are all original! There are a total of five stages: “Wonderland,” “Diversity,” “Fantasy,” “The Airport,” and “The Pier.” The events that occur in each stage will trigger various missions, and by completing those missions, your escape may be made easier through things like the escape area expanding or obstructing the release of Hunters.</p><p><strong>Series Mainstays Return</strong></p><p>Popular elements from the series will of course return, including “GameShare” and “Local Communication Play” with up to four players, “Hard Mode” featuring “Hyper Hunters” with enhanced performance, and “Trophy” and “Hunter Figure” collecting.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/run-for-money-hunters-vs-runners-can-you-win-as-either-adds-switch-2-version-launches-december-4-in-japan]]></content:encoded>

<p>New features, but no game update</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Switch Online's 'Nintendo Classics' library has this week been expanded with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> and the Japan-only release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a>. Although the GBA title hasn't been made available locally, the app here has received an update, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>Firstly, the official banner and icon for this app have been updated – swapping out the 'Switch Online' branding for 'Nintendo Classics'. Apart from this, there's <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-classics-switch-online-gba-app-adds-new-functionality/">reportedly been some added "functionality"</a> including button remapping options along with 1080p support in handheld mode on Switch 2.</p>
<p>An easter egg has also been added to the start up screen. If you hold the left analogue stick when starting the app, the original GBA boot up screen will appear (<a href="https://www.vooks.net/game-boy-advance-boot-screen-easter-egg-add-to-switch-nintendo-classics-app/">here's a look via Vooks.net</a>).</p>
<p>Since the release of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has updated its other Switch Online retro apps with new features, improved filters and additional games. Nintendo highlighted the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/icymi-nintendo-highlights-super-nes-nintendo-classics-features-update">updates to its SNES app</a> in a new video last week, including mouse support for multiple titles.</p>

Rhythm Psychosis</em> is a rhythm adventure game about a psychotic hikikomori girl—also an avid anonymous poster—who corrupts the world with her severe brain rot from listening to too many denpa songs. Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.</p><ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified. Social media is all about sharing – spread your heartful psychosis to everyone else!</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Qtie</strong> – The main character. A hikikomori. She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Special Transmission Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="⚠『Yunyun Syndrome!?

<p>One issue was tied to the game's resolution not being properly optimised. Fortunately, it looks like SEGA has taken player feedback on board, with the company's official Japanese social media account revealing there'll be a patch to address this. Here's the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In response to feedback from all players, we are currently developing an update patch to improve the screen resolution in the Nintendo Switch version of this title. Please wait a little longer until the patch is released.</p>
<p>We hope you continue to enjoy Shinobi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this patch is on the way for the Switch version, so hopefully players won't have to wait much longer. Apart from the game's resolution, in our review build, we encountered some frame rate issues.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft announced it was kicking off its anniversary celebrations for Rayman.</p>
<p>Over the next month, it intends to share all sorts of updates about its iconic video game mascot, and today it announced its free-to-play multiplayer brawler <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/brawlhalla">Brawlhalla</a> will also be celebrating the character with a special event.</p>
<p>This includes a new "Super Metal Epic Skin" (for 300 Mammoth Coins) and two brand new maps, Enchanted Forest (free-for-all Map) and Enchanted Forest Arena (Kung Foot Map).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>It’s time to celebrate! To commemorate 30 years of our limbless hero, the Champion of the Glade of Dreams himself is getting his first Epic Skin. Inspired by his appearance with the Heavy Metal Fist power-up, Super Metal Rayman is ready to rock with custom animated Weapon Skins, Signature FX swaps, unique Character Select animation, and roster portrait. Plus, there will be a new Companion, Sidekick, and more to enjoy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update also includes an "earnable avatar" Classic Rayman, a Murfy Companion (who will join you in battle and react to the events of the match), and a Forest Dragon Sidekick. There are also new themed emojis and more.</p>
<h3>Super Metal Rayman Bundle</h3>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Streameast, the world’s largest illegal sports streaming site, has pitched its final inning, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6591670/2025/09/03/streameast-worlds-largest-illegal-sports-streaming-platform-shut-down-in-sting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Athletic</a>. This follows a year-long investigation on the part of the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) – a coalition of companies and film studios that includes Amazon, Netflix, and Paramount – which culminated in a Sunday night raid that led to the arrest of two men in Egypt. I will miss the site terribly, despite obviously having never interacted with it in any meaningful way.</p><p>Streameast, says The Atlantic, averaged a whopping 136 million monthly visits. If you could think of a major sport, odds are you could find it while sailing the site’s largely reliable waters. Many, many other sports streaming sites exist, but Streameast was comparatively sturdy and unwavering. An anchor. Some prominent games industry figures – who also presumably did not use the site, or perhaps even know what it was – have called this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lxx6cqnwfk2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their “9/11,”</a> given that NFL season is about to start.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, in my other neck of the woods, the MMA world, which is a cesspit I obsessively follow in spite of myself because it’s a good way to turn my brain off while watching terrible men pound theirs into mush, fans are apoplectic.</p><p>“NOOOOOO,” reads the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ufc/comments/1n7gb7i/noooooo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current top thread on the UFC subreddit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Back when they'd play the Russian national anthem over [fighter] walkout songs, lol,” reminisced one commenter.</p><p>“I don't know why I loved those little touches so much,” replied another. “Made me feel like I was watching with a real fan.”</p><p>Commenters also poured one out for dudes who went on racist rants in Streameast chat boxes, of which there were a truly tremendous number.</p><p>Others on both the UFC subreddit and within various corners of the wider sporting web are fixated on The Principle Of The Thing: sports organizations have found more and more ways to nickel and dime fans, with the current subscription model potentially demanding hundreds or – if you’re a UFC fan, at least <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/breaking-news/article/ufc-agrees-to-groundbreaking-77-billion-deal-with-paramount-and-cbs-ditching-pay-per-view-model-123522139.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALyLP-k-f8z1fQKIAqK6Qn6GIqwI_0c3p7frrz64laYitqq04Lzklf2h9fArvxMvMEEJhSk8OEsXL_PZAdZGH-RretfZoznN5kdmFCPZFS8_3iUb7VJs9nM_gPICtCElS9HeqMGK2AU8BicZPBj0W-SB7fzkyJLws3p4vGFfTQde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until next year</a> – thousands of dollars per year across multiple services. Sites like Streameast function as modern-day Robin Hoods, stealing from multibillion-dollar corporations to give a few hours of entertainment to the poor (and make money via ads, millions of dollars in Streameast’s case, which muddies the waters perhaps more than a little).</p><p>There’s just one problem with the way many publications are framing this story: Streameast does not appear to be entirely gone. The illicit sports kingpin has historically gotten around shutdowns via a series of different URLs, many of which continue to function as of this publishing. ACE told The Atlantic that these are merely “copycats,” but they seem to be closely tied to the mothership.</p><p>The sporting powers that be and various national governments might eventually find a way to whack-a-mole all of the URLs into oblivion, but even then, illicit streaming sites tend to operate like Hydras; when one head gets chopped off, another rises up to take its place. If this truly proves to be Streameast’s demise, it will likely still be a long time before [DOZENS OF NAMES REDACTED, BECAUSE HOW WOULD I EVEN KNOW THEM] meet similar ends.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime"><h3>I Unironically Like Netflix’s Live-Action Kakegurui TV Series</h3></a><p>Bet is a fun watch when you don’t have sweaty anime fans breathing down your neck
