			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be fully backward compatible with Switch titles. However, fans have been wondering for how long Nintendo would continue to release games for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the subject in the company's usual post-quarterly earnings <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A with investors</a>. The executive said that more original Switch games will be made, but at the same time, he highlighted the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p><em>We have already announced Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond for Nintendo Switch in 2025. We will continue developing Nintendo Switch titles, but launching exclusive games for Nintendo Switch 2 is essential for its success. However, we aim to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms.</em></p>
<p>This tells us that it may not be long before we get the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, as Nintendo has a vested interest in getting users to transition from one generation to another. Besides, the original Switch is clearly on a downward trajectory for its sales, as evidenced even in the last quarter during which 'only' 4.82 million units were sold. Still, it was enough to allow the hybrid console to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break the big 150 million sales milestone</a>.</p>
<p>Third-party may leave behind the original Nintendo Switch even quicker. Since they already largely switched from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X as the default targets for new games, it won't make much sense for them to spend time trying to make more complex titles fit the aging Switch hardware when there's a new platform with support for technologies like NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Nintendo Switch 2 is slated to launch later this year. Between April and June, hands-on events will take place worldwide; before that, on April 2, Nintendo will unveil many more details about the new console. So far, analysts have <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded positively</a> to the brief teaser trailer shared in January.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flopped-because-of-no-shared-world-elements-ea-says.1100790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new financial earnings call for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and in the call, CEO Andrew Wilson expresses what appears to be a theory as to why&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped.</p>

<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>and flagship sports game&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>had both "underperformed", and in the new <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">call</a>, Wilson seems to draw a link between&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s failure and its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>He says EA's games need to "directly connect" to players, who he says "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement". That's likely a reference to&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s nature as a single-player-only title, rather than a game with multiplayer elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=2SNx5ha0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=Hahr8U2D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA seems to think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped because it had no "shared world elements".</figcaption></figure><p>At one stage, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that a version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>(which didn't have its name yet at this point) which would incorporate live service elements was in development.</p>

<p>However, this version was subsequently scrapped (assuming the reports of its existence are correct), leading to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s single-player focus. It seems that EA's management now regrets getting rid of those live service elements.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have performed any better if it did have the "shared world" elements EA seems so wistful about. After all,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a live service title, and it, too, underperformed.</p>

<p>Wilson, however, puts this down to people sticking with previous&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>titles and not buying the new one, as well as "lower-than-expected engagement" due to "specific issues with balance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=aO4FZa9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=T3jxwU9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance had nothing to do with live service, but&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s apparently did. Hmm.</figcaption></figure><p>I can't imagine that many of the people who felt dissatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have been happier if the game had featured the "shared world elements" EA regrets not putting in, honestly.</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine that direction would have prevented the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare layoffs that followed</a>, nor the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departure</a> of <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>director Corinne Busche from the studio.</p>

<p>In any case, EA is probably looking very carefully at the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game now. I'd be very surprised indeed if the publisher didn't try to ensure that some sort of "shared world elements" are present in that game, so we'll have to see how&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>(name obviously not final) performs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the call, EA confirms that the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will be launching in 2026 and reaffirms that you can sign up to get a chance to test it right now via the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>.</p>

<p>The company also commits to a new $1 billion share buyback scheme, which feels like exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from a studio that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">paid its CEO $25 million in 2023</a> despite hundreds of layoffs. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And...yeah! It’s looking good. It’s looking like if the director of <em>Monsters</em> made a <em>Jurassic World</em> movie. For good reason.</p><p>Set five years after 2022's abysmal&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>, this seventh movie in the franchise appears to be a new attempt at a fresh start, with an entirely new cast and director Gareth Edwards helming the project. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey as a team of action-paleontologists, sent to what <em>might</em> be Isla Sorna (it’s referred to in the trailer as the research island for the original park) to recover DNA from the three largest dinos living on the island.

It’ll be interesting to see if his long absence from enormo-budget filmmaking will have allowed a better focus of his more personal, tell-don’t-show attitude toward threats, when applied to a crowd-pleaser like <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World</em>. The trailer seems positive, to me. Sure, there are loads of dinosaurs, because of course there are, but it all feels more cramped, more claustrophobic, than the bland photography of the three previous films.</p><p>We’ll find out if it all comes together on July 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OverActive Media, the parent company behind the Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra, has published a statement following the recent Major tournament held in Madrid, Spain. In a press release, it was confirmed that Major I, the first sizeable tournament of the CDL 2025 season, was ‘the most successful Major (they) have ever hosted’.</p>



<p>It was revealed that 80% of attendees at the venue in the Spanish city were from <strong>outside </strong>the country and that 12,000 people in total flocked to the Caja Mágica arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-defining-moment">‘A Defining Moment’</h2>



<p>OverActive Media’s CEO, Adam Adamou, explained in the press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By bringing together top-tier talent, innovative strategies, and fresh ideas, we are strengthening our connections with fans while unlocking new revenue streams and growth opportunities. </p>



<p>The energy in&nbsp;Madrid&nbsp;and the success of our acquisitions reaffirm our commitment to building a global esports company that entertains millions while creating sustainable growth.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Major I was the most successful Major we have ever hosted. We sold more than 12,000 tickets, with more than 80% traveling from outside&nbsp;Spain, driving tourism and significant economic impact for the local community. </p>



<p>The energy in the arena, the intense competition, and the global engagement made this event a defining moment for the Call of Duty League and a clear statement on the sustainable growth of our esports presence in&nbsp;Europe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CDL Major in Madrid and caught up with many of the best Call of Duty players in the world. I was able to sit down with Atlanta FaZe, the team that won the tournament after a gruelling Grand Final against the LA Thieves.</p>



<p>The CDL Major I event was a boon to kickstart the latest competitive season. More than 233,000 consecutive viewers tuned in from around the world, and the showcase proved that Europe can be one of the most lucrative regions to host further Call of Duty events. This was the first CDL Major to take place in Europe in the history of the tournament.</p>



<p>Next, the Call of Duty League will head back to the United States, with Major II taking place in Texas in March 2025.</p>



<p>Later this year, in the summer, Toronto Ultra will host another CDL event – the Call of Duty League Championship tournament in Canada.</p>

The latest release was EA Sports FC 25 this past September. However, the soccer games released on Switch have been heavily criticized. Meanwhile, Madden has been a complete no-show. Overall, EA has been selective with support for Switch, with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-might-finally-get-a-sims-game-but-maybe-not-the-one-you-expect/1100-6526093/">My Sims: Cozy Bundle</a>, It Takes Two, and Apex Legends coming to the console over the years. Looking ahead, EA just teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/">the next entry in the Battlefield series</a> while also introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/">the community-testing program Battlefield Labs</a>. There's been no mention of a Switch 2 release for it, though.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Nintendo finally unveiled Switch 2</a> last month, showing off magnetic Joy-Cons and an apparently new Mario Kart game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/onimusha-2-remaster-capcom-fighting-collection-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that a remaster of PS2 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and we now also have a release date for the upcoming retro pack&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

<p>During a livestream, Capcom revealed the&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster, which will come to last-gen consoles, Switch, and PC sometime this year. Strangely enough, it doesn't seem to be getting a native PS5 or Xbox Series X|S version, although you will likely be able to play it on those machines.</p>

<p>We don't know exactly what features the remaster will boast, but it's likely to sport revamped visuals and improved gameplay, so if you found the original&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>a bit too clunky in its PS2-era iteration, you'll probably want to check this out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-remaster-gogandantess.jpg?itok=rw6mI1W2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-remaster-gogandantess.jpg?itok=WwFQvPtU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The demon swordsman Gogandantess returns this year in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>It's likely Capcom is reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>in order to drum up interest in the series ahead of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, the next major entry in the series, which is due to land sometime next year. It'll serve that purpose alongside the&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">anime</a>, which aired on Netflix in 2023.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why the studio hasn't chosen to remaster the first game, that's probably because a remastered version is already available across PC and last-gen machines.</p>

<p>As well as the<em>&nbsp;Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster, Capcom also revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2&nbsp;</em>during the aforementioned livestream. The game will hit PC, Switch, and last-gen consoles on May 16th, and pre-orders are open now if that's your thing.</p>




<p><em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2&nbsp;</em>will feature eight retro Capcom fighting gems, and there's only one&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>game in the collection as well, which arguably shows a pretty significant degree of restraint. Here's the full list!</p>

<ul><li><em>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</em></li>
	<li><em>Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001</em></li>
	<li><em>Capcom Fighting Evolution</em></li>
	<li><em>Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER</em></li>
	<li><em>Project Justice</em></li>
	<li><em>Power Stone</em></li>
	<li><em>Power Stone 2</em></li>
	<li><i>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</i></li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect from a modern fighting game, all of these games will support online play, and they'll boast rollback netcode as well.</p>

<p>If you want to watch Capcom's full Capcom Spotlight showcase, which also includes a full&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>presentation ahead of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release later this month</a>, you can do so below.</p>

<p>Due to recent feedback, Pokemon TCG Pocket announced that players will receive 1,000 Trade Tokens as a Gift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading feature has received a lot of criticism since its release, primarily due to the features’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> and the cost of trades (tokens). Many players have complained about the price being too high to perform a sufficient number of trades, and there aren’t many ways to earn them either. Due to this feedback, TCG Pocket has <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decided</a> to gift players 1,000 free Trade Tokens while they investigate ways to improve the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-1-000-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-nbsp">How to Claim Free 1,000 Trade Tokens in Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers have made it simple for players to claim these free Trade Tokens. All they need to do is visit the Gifts menu, which players can access by clicking the icon on the top right corner of the home screen. Here, they will find a gift from the development team, which includes 1,000 Trade Tokens. Click on the ‘Claim’ button to add the tokens to your inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-time-smackdown-emblem-event">Space-Time Smackdown Emblem Event </h2>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has recently released its Space-Time Smackdown expansion, which introduces over 140 cards from the Sinnoh region, along with legendary Pokemon like Dialga and Palkia. The developers currently host an <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1886942825222168827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emblem event</a> where players can earn emblems depending on their wins against other players. One win will provide a participation emblem, five wins will get you a bronze emblem, 25 wins will get you a silver emblem, and 45 wins will let you earn a Gold Emblem. Players can also complete other missions to gain items like Shinedust and more.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Spider-Man 2 had a bit of a rough landing on PC last week, the game getting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/01/spider-man-2-pc-port-gets-a-rough-reception-over-performance-and-graphical-issues/">a resoundingly ‘mixed’ reception</a> in the community-led Steam reviews, but is it really as bad as that made it sound?</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/second-spider-man-2-pc-hotfix-targets-crashes-frame-rate-blockers-and-missing-achievements/">two hotfix updates</a> on either side of the weekend, the most significant game crashing bugs should have been stamped out already, and awareness over the need to install the latest GPU drivers (even the sneaky optional ones) has also spread. That should leave performance as the main bugbear to address,</p>

<p>We’ve tested the game across two configurations. For one it’s a Ryzen 5900X paired with a Radeon RX 6800, and in the other a Ryzen 5800X with a GeForce RTX 3070, both combinations that’s are step ahead of the base PS5 and one dose of PSSR behind the PS5 Pro for the RX 6800. From the system requirements table, it’s good for 1440p at high graphics settings, without ray tracing, but from a couple hours of experimentation, it’s far more capable and flexible than that.</p>
<p>The first hurdle before getting into the game, though, was needing to update the graphics drivers. The most recent standard drivers from AMD are from December 2024, but Spider-Man 2 support comes in the “optional” 25.1.1 update that isn’t offered up by default in the Radeon software. Without that you get a mean looking warning screen when trying to launch the game!</p>

<p>But once in the game and with the default 1440p and high preset, the game runs at a nice and pretty much locked 60fps, thanks in no small part to the excellent dynamic resolution scaling used to hit a frame rate target, using any of FSR, DLSS, XeSS or Insomniac’s own IGTI to upscale. Disable dynamic resolutions and upscaling and the RX 6800 still does a solid job of staying above 60, only really dipping to the mid-high 50s during the most stressful moments.</p>

<p>Adding ray tracing into the mix – there’s settings for ray-traced reflections, interiors, shadows and ambient occlusion, as well as object range, and Nvidia’s ray reconstruction &nbsp;– and that naturally pushes things harder. Without upscaling, performance on the RX 6800 with ‘High’ ray tracing at 1440p dropped the lower parts of the curve to the 40s, while ‘Very High’ is better thought of as a 30fps mode here – it often clings to the upper 20s.</p>
<p>It is worth it, if you have a beefy enough GPU. The ‘High’ preset is amusingly named as the minimum bar for ray tracing effects, adding RT reflections and RT interiors for the game’s cunning building interior trick. The problem is that it’s a rather fuzzy looking effect that shimmers a lot on window edges and affects even the shiny chrome on cars, regardless of resolution or upscaling technique. Once you switch to ‘Very High’ the reflection quality is improved dramatically, but you also get RT shadows and RT ambient occlusion, which much better place objects in the world. Still, bumping up just RT reflections to Very High is the most impactful improvement.</p>

<p>If performance is on the cusp, you can step the resolution down to 1080p and get a bit of a frame rate bump, or just let the dynamic resolution take over with a target of 60fps, maintaining the 1440p highs for whenever the engine can handle it, and making up the difference with upscaling.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story with the RTX 3070, where 60fps is readily achievable on the ‘High’ preset without ray tracing, though the introduction of ‘High’ ray tracing seems to come at a greater cost than that seen with the RX 6800, dropping into the 30s when the on-screen action is at its most hectic – we’d suspect that the 8GB of VRAM on this card is having an impact here, in tandem with DirectStorage using the GPU to decompress textures from the SSD.</p>
<p>Either way there’s still greater headroom and more incremental control in Spider-Man 2 on PC to outperform the base PS5 version, and the PS5 Pro update, if your rig is capable of it. That’s similar to that found in the PC port of the original Spider-Man, but it’s fair to say that the baseline has been raised.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Spider-Man 2 is being able to quickly toggle between all manner of graphical settings with a rendered scene shown in the background of the menu. It is near instantaneous when toggling on PS5 Pro, but on PC and with so many hardware variables, it triggers a shader recompilation step with any significant changes – if you don’t let these process, there can also be shader compilation hitches during gameplay, and it will take a while for RT effects to actually start rendering.</p>

<p>While it comes with a performance cost, I would definitely recommend at least turning on ray traced reflections. There’s fewer fallback cube map reflections in Spider-Man 2, since playing without RT is not an option on PS5. Cars do have a minimal skybox reflection, but there’s basically no reflections on building windows and sky scrapers, making them look very flat and lifeless when the mirror-like buildings are so much a part of New York’s identity.</p>
<p>In general, we haven’t found anywhere near the kinds of issues that have seen the game receive a wash of negative reviews on Steam. Some of those were due to game crashes that a hotfix was released to address by the weekend, while others complained about performance. Of course, we’ve been talking and playing with 60fps in mind throughout here, purely from the age and specs of our GPUs, but anyone with an RTX 4080, RTX 4090, or Radeon 7900 XT is going to be expecting frame rates pushing toward triple figures, and that colours the perspective.</p>
<p>In our experience, you’re not relying too heavily on dynamic resolutions and upscaling to high the graphics presets provided by Sony, but there’s plenty of scope to tweak settings and apply some upscaling to get core ray tracing features and a solid 60fps performance that matches or betters the game on PS5. All in all, Spider-Man 2 on PC has proven to be a reliable performer in both of our use cases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/ninja-gaiden-2-black-five-essential-techniques-to-master-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 has been long considered among the finest character action games ever released, but a complete newcomer to the series will hardly feel the same when playing any of the game's iterations, including the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. The game developed by Team NINJA is unlike action games from other studios like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, as it is a game that pushes players to play as optimally as possible, not just to hit high scores as in the Bayonetta series but to actually survive combat encounters, which can get hectic fast.</p>
<p>As such, the best way to understand the brilliance of the Ninja Gaiden 2 Black experience is to learn and master the game, starting with some essential techniques that will help you during your first playthrough and teach you how to handle the game's many challenges to take on higher difficulty settings.</p>
<h2>Stand Your Ground</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250127184908_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike other action games, blocking in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is an extremely powerful defensive technique that is way more effective than dodging in the vast majority of combat scenarios. As such, don't hesitate to keep the block button pushed down as enemies come at you, as you will be able to negate all damage safely. Sometimes, your guard may be broken, but you can easily avoid damage by pushing the left stick in the direction you want to dodge. Blocking will also become available as soon as the dodging animation is complete, allowing you to continue negating damage.</p>
<p>By just defending, however, you aren't going to defeat your enemies, so you should use blocking to learn enemy patterns and unleash combos and special techniques when it is safe to do so. Think of offense and defense in Ninja Gaiden 2 as in a fighting game, where some moves are safe on block and some aren't.</p>
<h2>Master Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135242_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While each weapon has tons of combos and special techniques, which are further expanded with upgrades, there are some techniques that are absolutely essential to master. The first one is the Flying Swallow, a special aerial attack that can be used by jumping and pressing heavy attack and a direction to safely attack enemies and quickly reposition if needed. The second one is the iconic Izuna Drop, which is unleashed with select weapons by launching an enemy in the air and hitting them with three light attacks and one heavy attack. What makes this technique so useful is the fact that it instantly kills enemies.</p>
<p>The best thing about these two techniques is that they are available for use right from the very beginning of the game, as it is possible to perform them with Ryu's starting weapon, the Dragon Sword. They can be used with other weapons as well, so experiment with them to find which works best for you.</p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Ninpo Spells' Invincibility</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135610_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninpo Spells are another important part of Ryu Hayabusa's arsenal in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, as they can be used to unleash some rather powerful attacks. What makes them more useful than they may look at a glance is the invincibility some of them grant before the spell goes off. Use this invincibility window to get some heat off of you.</p>
<h2>Learn When to Use Ultimate Techniques Properly</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135327_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimate Techniques are among the least used combat techniques in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black by beginners, as they can be difficult to use properly with little knowledge of enemies' patterns and abilities as they require charging. However, you really should learn how to use them properly if you want to truly master the game, as they are extremely powerful and they can clear enemy groups in very little time.</p>
<p>The best way to use Ultimate Techniques properly is to start charging them when there's Essence floating around, which speeds up the charging process considerably once absorbed. As such, you will want to not absorb the resource right after an enemy is defeated, and there are two ways to do this: you either keep yourself away from it as much as possible, or you keep blocking. Position yourself properly by jumping and then blocking as soon as you land, start charging your Ultimate Attack, and watch your enemies explode in a glorious, gory mess.</p>
<h2>Watch and Adapt</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250129191059_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the general high speed of the experience, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black wants players to really look at enemies and not just to learn their attack patterns. After dealing some damage, Ryu may cut limbs from enemies, which not only limits their abilities, although they get access to desperate and damaging new attacks,&nbsp; but makes them susceptible to dismemberment, which can be accomplished by hitting them with a heavy attack. Given how important it is to reduce enemy numbers as quickly as possible, always keep an eye on the enemy's current state, and unleash insta-kill attacks as soon as possible!</p>

Not only do we have the launch of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-its-taking-all-possible-measures-to-beat-switch-2-scalpers">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its exclusive games to contend with, but we’ve got a long list of big hitters set for later in 2025, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>. And then there’s the inevitable new Call of Duty from Activision, no doubt set for October or November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the big one is Rockstar’s guaranteed behemoth <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still down for release in fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Will it be delayed? Parent company Take-Two is so far sticking to the fall 2025 release window, but it’s that uncertainty coupled with all the other huge shooters coming out that means EA’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs">Battlefield</a> may face a tricky job carving out some space for itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has the next Battlefield down for its 2026 fiscal year, which means before April 2026. That’s prime GTA 6 territory right there, and maybe even prime Call of Duty and Borderlands 4 territory. So, how much does EA have to consider release dates from competing games when it comes to working out when to launch Battlefield?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fair bit, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in a recent financial call — and it may even be willing to delay Battlefield if it has to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Certainly we exist in a competitive marketplace,” Wilson said in response to a question from an analyst on this exact topic. “I've had the great fortune to be in this company for 25 years and we have done a great job of competing with all of our great franchises over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That being said, we've invested more in this Battlefield than any Battlefield before. We have four studios. We've had a meaningful amount of time. We're looking for this to be the biggest Battlefield we've ever made. And we of course want to make sure that we launch that into a window where we can deliver on the fullness of the promise of what Battlefield can be and grow the community to a level that is commensurate with the size of the game that we're making.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do believe that this year might be a nuanced year relative to competition. There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing. We have an FY 26 launch window that the team is targeting. We believe the game will be great and ready at that time, but if we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, the new Battlefield will be out before April 2026. Let’s say November 2025 (Battlefield 2042 came out November 2021 and Battlefield 5 came out November 2018). What if GTA 6 launches in or around then? Perhaps EA will, in response, push Battlefield back to the first quarter of 2026, still making its fiscal year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what if it intends to release Battlefield Q1 2026 already, and then Rockstar announces a GTA 6 delay to Q1 2026? Could EA bring Battlefield forward? Or maybe it would, in that case, push Battlefield out of the fiscal year and into the next. That would be a big decision, but based on Wilson's comments, something EA is prepared for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see why EA, and, we’ve heard, many other third-party publishers are holding their breath as they wait for Rockstar to announce the news the entire industry is hanging on: the GTA 6 release date. Once that’s out in the open, whether it’s for this fall as planned or a delay into 2026, all the other pieces will fall no doubt into place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-madden-and-fc-might-find-real-energy-on-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, EA is eyeing the Nintendo Switch 2 as a platform for its games. In a recent financial call, CEO Andrew Wilson was asked directly about Nintendo’s next-gen console, and he replied to suggest the company has plans to release many of its games there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson singled out EA's money-spinning sports franchises, Madden and FC, as potentially finding “real energy” on Nintendo Switch 2, and also pointed to The Sims as a game that could do well on the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anytime a new console comes into the marketplace that's of a benefit to us, it gives us the ability to access and acquire new players,” Wilson said. “Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly our expectation is that products like FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you think about something like The Sims and the My Sims cozy bundle, which performed well ahead of our expectations, 50% of all players were new to EA. That represents a great opportunity for us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So again, nothing in our models at this juncture, but our expectation is that anytime a great new console comes in the marketplace that gives us access to new players and new communities, that we have the IP that will benefit from that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it comes as little surprise to hear the likes of Madden and FC will be released on Nintendo Switch 2, fans will be wondering what version of those games they can expect on the console. Historically, EA has released what it calls “legacy” versions of FIFA on Nintendo Switch, but in recent years it has aimed for feature parity for the rebranded FC franchise. Given the Switch 2 will be a more powerful console than its predecessor, perhaps FC 26, say, will be closer to the FC 26 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Nintendo has announced the Switch 2</a>, we’re starting to build a picture of what to expect on it in terms of games.

The long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong is also rumored to be set for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Nintendo, we know it’s working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-9-every-character-track-and-vehicle-confirmed-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-game">a new Mario Kart</a>.

We have been trying, tuning, and testing many things in the context of the ongoing support of the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we think about Apex today, I really think about the development happening across three core vectors. The first is how do we continue to support this incredible community that plays the game day-in and day-out, which numbers tens of millions of people, and that's both quality-of-life, anti-cheat, and all of the things that make the core experience great as well as the creation of new content for that community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we continue to try and test and develop more and great content for that community. And I would say we have seen some progress in that, but probably not as much as we would have liked.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s EA going to do to turn Apex Legends around in financial terms? Wilson said it’s working on a major update to the game, what he called Apex Legends 2.0, that sounds designed to reinvigorate the franchise, bring more people into the game, and, yes, make more money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Wilson said he doesn’t want to release Apex Legends 2.0 on top of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs">the next Battlefield</a>, which is due out before April 2026. It’ll come out after that, so, probably, at some point during EA’s 2027 fiscal year ending March 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do believe there will be a time where we need to do a more meaningful update of Apex as a broad game experience, and the team is diligently working on that,” Wilson said. “You should imagine we probably wouldn't drop that on top of a Battlefield launch. And so from a timing standpoint, our thinking right now is that that would exist post-Battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then on a longer-term time horizon, again, these franchises that exist at this level and have this much fan love don't come along all that often. What I think we've demonstrated as a company is an ability to build franchises that last 10, 20, 30 years and growing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our expectation is that Apex will also be one of those franchises and that sometime on a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the team remains incredibly committed. We continue to invest behind the core community who continues to play, that numbers in the tens of millions of players. We do believe that there should be a more major update that will probably happen after a Battlefield launch just in terms of timing, and the team is diligently working through what that would be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then longer-term, our expectation is that we'll continue to expand what this franchise is and how we support a core community of highly competitive players and new communities that want to come and experience all the greatness that Apex has to offer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apex Legends 2.0 sounds a bit like what Activision tried with Call of Duty battle royale Warzone, which rebooted somewhat with a 2.0 version in 2022. The jury is still out on whether that was the right move, with fans of the free-to-play shooter often reminiscing about Warzone as it was in the first two years of its life. The situation with Apex Legends is different, of course, but EA will be mindful of how its competitors in the battle royale market have fared as they work to grow its player base.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Apex Legends remains one of the top-played games on Steam via concurrent player count (Microsoft and Sony do not make player numbers public). However, it is well past its peak on Valve’s platform, and is on a trajectory to hit record lows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-gacha-boss-under-fire-for-huge-nintendo-esque-salary-as-puzzle-dragons-sees-rapid-decline<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Puzzle &amp; Dragons developer Gung Ho has come under fire from its shareholders, who have complained about the extremely high salary of its president and poor returns on their investments.</p>
<p>Strategic Capital, an investment advisory firm, has submitted a <a href="https://stracap.jp/english/3765-GUNGHO.pdf">report</a> on behalf of company shareholders requesting Gung Ho "up its game" as it highlights a number of issues (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/all-youve-done-is-waste-100-billion-yen-japanese-gacha-game-giant-put-on-blast-by-shareholders-for-milking-same-hit-for-13-years-while-releasing-failures/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>The biggest is the salary of president Kazuki Morishita, who received 340m yen (£1.77m) in 2023. That's similar to the total remuneration of Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa (360m yen), and above similar figures at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Sony, Capcom, Konami, and Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>That's despite Gung Ho relying on mobile gacha game Puzzle &amp; Dragons - its biggest hit - for revenue since its release in 2012, despite its revenue declining since 2014. Indeed, the report states Gung Ho has made less than a 10th of Nintendo's profits, despite their presidents having similar salaries.</p>
<p>While the company has released 20 games since 2012, including based on popular IPs from Disney and Yo-kai Watch, the company has reportedly not been able to shake its dependence on Puzzle &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p>The report estimates Gung Ho has spent over 100bn yen developing new titles, but these have collectively earned less than 10bn yen.</p>

<p>To summarise, then, Gung Ho has a single but gradually fading hit game, has struggled to release another success, and is led by a president taking home an extortionate salary that far exceeds company profits. And now there's friction between company leaders and shareholders.</p>
<p>Gung Ho did see huge success with Puzzle &amp; Dragons, a free-to-play match-three puzzle game that was the first mobile game to gross $1bn in revenue. In Japan, Nintendo even licensed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-licenses-mario-version-of-free-to-play-mobile-money-spinner-puzzle-and-dragons">Mario-themed version of the game for 3DS</a>.</p>
<p>Strategic Capital's report suggests reform by going private and a review of the remuneration system. It also states the company has "excessive" cash reserves, which (unlike Nintendo) is viewed negatively due to low value.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Vendrán Las Aves - "The Birds Will Come" - is a brief, quiet, hopeful game about burnout recovery. Summarised as a "slice of life tamagotchi" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-cosmic-wheel-sisterhood">The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</a>.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://deconstructeam.itch.io/vendran-las-aves">free to download from Itch.io</a>, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this happens by way of simple resource allocation. Each day, the character wakes with a few points of energy. You must divide this between things like eating, watching TV and doing the laundry, doling out their time in such a way that they wake the next morning feeling a little more refreshed, and a little more inclined to pick up the shiny new axe propped in the corner. It's not an even process. Sometimes, you only have the wherewithal to order takeaway and doomscroll. But tomorrow is another day. One thing that comes across unsaid is the importance of asking others for help - and accepting it when they offer. If your mum comes over for a chat with a Tupperware of food, it'll save you a few points cooking that you can put towards reading a book, or doing some exercise.</p>
<p>I found Vendrán Las Aves to be a fair approximation of my own experiences of burnout in my twenties and thirties - that feeling of mingled emptiness and restlessness, passivity and urgency, the frustration at discovering yourself to be finite, and the growing worry that the world ends outside your apartment door. Portraying it all as a question of points might seem reductive; personally, I have often found it useful, in a short-term sense, to quantify things this way.</p><p>I also like that while criticism of the character's employer is alluded to in dialogue - burnout is a structural phenomenon, not an individual condition - this exists alongside their love of their craft. There's an uplifting ending, but no tidy resolution. That said, it should of course be stressed that Vendrán Las Aves is not a mental health pamphlet. If you're feeling drained and disempowered yourself, <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/workplace/mental-health-at-work/">this Mind UK page</a> might suggest a few next steps.</p>
<p>I'm interested in the framing of this as a tamagotchi game - in practice, it reminded me more of Zoe Quinn's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mostly-indescribable-depression-quest">Depression Quest</a>. While I found Vendrán Las Aves to be a constructive, compassionate account of a low period in somebody's life, the association with virtual pets seems fraught and could be unpacked further, given that flesh-and-blood animals are often required to play the role of emotional supports. Beyond that, let me nudge you in the direction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eliza-review">Eliza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It becomes apparent early on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and difficulty go hand in hand. I wouldn’t say it’s “Souls” levels of difficulty, but it’s easy to be caught out in KC2. If you’re reading this, you know what I mean, and I’m here to see if you can stop seeing the game over screen as regularly.</p>



<p>2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance became a fan-favorite for its setting, characters, and immersive gameplay. Its mechanics included a lot of realism-based actions: Needing to hydrate, the necessity of eating and sleeping, and the punishing nature of its combat. KC wasn’t easy, and despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling 8 million copies</a>, the brutal nature of its combat wasn’t for everyone.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> has improved in almost every way. But one noticeable area that feels the same is the rugged and tough gameplay battle encounters. This is why players are already questioning if difficulty settings exist in KC2.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-change-the-difficulty-settings-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Can You Change The Difficulty Settings in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t you laugh at me, good sir. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>I can confirm you can’t change the difficulty settings in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It uses a default difficulty setting designed to accommodate all players—meaning you might struggle in moments.</strong></p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hasn’t budged in the difficulty settings department (kind of, but more later) and you need to adapt. You learn early on you need to take the RPG seriously. If you don’t stock up on Bandages, you bleed to death. If you carry an assortment of rancid meat for days on end, you have no food, and you starve to death.</p>



<p>Additionally, you will die <em>repeatedly </em>if you don’t adhere to the nuances of KC2’s combat mechanics. Even I find it easy to become overwhelmed by a fight, and I end up mashing the main attack button. You know what happens? You already know it.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-make-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-harder-hardcore-mode-explained">Can You Make Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Harder? Hardcore Mode Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Oh good. Credit to “Kingdom Come: Deliverance II – Roadmap Trailer | PS5 Games” Trailer on YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is getting a Hardcore Mode as post-launch content.</strong></p>



<p>The forthcoming gameplay addition was announced during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DMCj5dtJLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roadmap Trailer</a> announcement. Along with a bunch of new content coming after KC2’s debut—including a Barber feature, Horse Racing, and new Quests—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> includes Hardcore Mode.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios hasn’t confirmed what Hardcore Mode entails, but history tells us KC2 is about to become a lot tougher. If I use Bethesda’s Fallout series as a classic example, the franchise’s Hardcore Mode typically makes healing and all status conditions recover a lot slower, items weigh more, and fast travel affects player status too.</p>



<p>There are so many avenues the developer can go with KC2’s Hardcore Mode. The one thing I’m confident about is if you playthrough Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Hardcore Mode, you’re going to have a heck of a challenge on your hands.</p>



<p>We don’t know when it’s coming yet, but stay tuned for updates on the Hardcore Mode content patch.</p>

<p>Is a Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Hardcore Mode right up your alley? Or do you think the developer needs to add difficulty settings to make the title more accessible? Let us know.</p>

            <p>EA and Maxis have issued a patch for the recently released Legacy editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims">The Sims 1</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>.</p>
<p>These games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">launched on Friday</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-reportedly-getting-pc-re-releases-this-week">earlier rumours suggested the classic life-sim series was making a trip back to its roots</a>. However, when they launched, many players were met with a number of rather glitchy issues and game crashes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314060/The_Sims_Legacy_Collection/#app_reviews_hash">Reviews</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314070/The_Sims_2_Legacy_Collection/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a> called the debut "farcical", "broken" and even a "waste of money", which has to sting. The games currently sit with a Mixed review average.</p>
<p>The team acknowledged the games had issues at the time, stating it would hop to it and sort out some fixes. And, true to its word, it has, sharing a generous set of patch notes for both The Sims 1 and 2 last night.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those who are enjoying the classic Sims game again (or, perhaps even for the first time, she writes suddenly realising there are people out there quite a bit younger than her who may not have been around when these games first came out) should now notice less crashes.</p>
<p>Additionally, players should now be able to click on parts of the neighbourhood they were initially not able to, despite it clearly intended to be doable. The travel screen should also not be quite to "garbled or glitched" now.</p>
<p>You can check out the full patch notes for The Sims Legacy and The Sims 2 Legacy below:</p>
<p><strong>The Sims Fixed Issues: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alt+Tab or Alt+Enter can sometimes cause a crash</li>
<li>Alt+Enter can sometimes cause the Windows title bar to be hidden</li>
<li>Alt+Enter can sometimes not toggle between full screen and windowed modes</li>
<li>On some systems, The Sims can appear to launch and then immediately exit (no splash screen displayed)</li>
<li>The Sims should now launch in most situations</li>
<li>In some cases where there is an underlying graphics issue, The Sims will display a message</li>
<li>Some players are unable to click on various parts of the neighbourhood map</li>
<li>The travel screen, when traveling between neighbourhoods/worlds, can sometimes appear garbled or glitched</li>
<li>The Sims might crash if you are not on the default neighbourhood, interact with another Sim, and then save</li>
<li>When using Alt+Enter to cycle window and zoom sizes, the HUD could be clipped. At this zoom level, The Sims will now instead clip from the top of the screen.</li>
<li>In some situations in windowed mode the title bar might not be visible</li>
<li>The Family friends counter could sometimes not be visible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sims General Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several players have had problems (e.g. walls, floors, objects not showing up; game not launching; other oddities) that are addressed by updating graphics drivers to the latest versions. Please make sure your drivers are up to date.</li>
<li>The Sims game window is of a fixed size that can't have its basic properties changed after it has launched. Moving the window from a monitor to another with a different, lesser resolution can lead to unexpected results, possibly even crashes. If you want to run The Sims on that second monitor please use the option "-monitor: [open pointy brackets] num [close pointy brackets]" to force it to launch on the other monitor. "0" is your primary monitor, a second monitor is "1" and so on. We are investigating adding this as a menu option in the future.</li>
<li>In some situations, players have noted that music only plays in Live mode. Please check your computer sound options and make sure that everything is properly configured (e.g. on a 5.1 surround system make sure that your center speaker is functioning).</li>
<li>You might be prompted to "Enable the help system" every time you return to a house. This is the game trying to have you complete the tutorial. This will continue to happen until you complete the tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sims 2 Fixed Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-Tab or Alt+Enter can sometimes cause a crash</li>
<li>Some players on EA App received an error message indicating that certain needed files were corrupt</li>
<li>The game would sometimes crash after creating a family</li>
<li>The game sometimes launched at a small resolution (800x600) and then scaled that small format to fill the entire monitor</li>
<li>In certain situations the game will launch and then immediately show a "DirectX" error, requiring use of the "-w" option to work around the problem</li>
<li>Sometimes a Sim (or multiple Sims) would disappear after the player moves to another lot or neighbourhood, or after leaving and rejoining the game despite saving</li>
<li>Sometimes non-adult Sims (children, pets) would disappear</li>
<li>Some interactions that result in a transferable reward (e.g. a dog returns from work) can cause the game to crash</li>
<li>Addressed some infinite loading screen issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Sims 2 General Notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several players have had problems that are addressed by updating graphics drivers to the latest versions. Please make sure your drivers are up to date.</li>
<li>Remember that the "boolProp testingCheatsEnabled" cheat will cause the game to periodically show various dialogue boxes with debugging information in them. The cheat is working as expected.</li>
<li>We are investigating an issue where during certain cinematic events (such as Alien Abduction), the Sim can be reset and the event fails. While we are investigating this, you can work around the issue by making certain there are no other Sims on the lot to observe the event.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Sims team is still working on some remaining issues. "Some topics can require an extended investigation on our end, so even though these fixes may be in active review, it's not a guarantee that we'll have an immediate fix for it in the upcoming patch," it wrote in a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/the-sims-game-info-hub-en/the-sims%E2%84%A2-legacy-and-the-sims%E2%84%A2-2-legacy-patch-notes/11861248">post regarding the latest patch</a>.</p>
<p>"Thank you for playing these games that are such a storied part of our history - starting 25 years ago!"</p>
<p>Please excuse me while I go and put in my dentures. </p></div>

			<p>Exploring the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth open world has become more immersive than ever, thanks to a newly released first-person view mod.</p>
<p>This new mod, which was developed by S3ik3n and can now be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/232?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, allows players to explore the open world with a first-person camera view, with the camera automatically reverting to third-person during combat to maintain playability. Unfortunately, it is not possible to play the entirety of the game in first person, even outside combat, as there are times the camera will revert to third person in certain areas. Still, this is a great mod for those looking for increased immersion, as highlighted by the screenshots below.</p>

<p>While the modding scene continues to grow with the development of plenty of mods that introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">new features</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/">enhance visuals</a>, Square Enix is also working on improving the PC port of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which launched in a much better state than the Remake port, but it's still far from being as good as it should have been. This week, the game received its<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-1-001-patch-direct-storage/"> first patch</a>, which improved game stability and updated DirectStorage to the latest version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/next-battlefield-fiscal-year-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next Battlefield game could be released as soon as this year, as publisher EA has recently confirmed the release window of the yet-to-be-named new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings results report for the third quarter of FY2025</a>, EA confirmed that the game will be released during the fiscal year 2026, which begins on April 1st, 2025, and ends on March 31st, 2026, so there's a solid chance it will be released before the end of the year. As the latest new main entries in the franchise have been launched in either October or November, EA is likely pinning for a late 2025 release for the next Battlefield as well, although it will probably take a few months to learn if the next entry in the series will be following what has become the franchise's tradition at this point.</p>
<p>While very little is currently known about the next Battlefield, it was made clear earlier this week that EA is determined to make its launch as good as possible. A few days back, the publisher unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/">Battlefield Labs</a>, a new testing environment that will allow the massive development team, which includes series' creator DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion, to quickly gather community feedback and improve the game as much as possible ahead of launch. More information on the new community testing environment can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM released a free Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark that allows PC users to gauge how the full game will run on their configurations. The benchmark<span>, which weighs 24.8 GB, can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a></span>. As usual for CAPCOM benchmarks, the user will be presented with a score at the end of the benchmarking; the developers have shared a table to outline the various score ranges.</p>
<table>

<p>The benchmark is fairly long, featuring a mix of cutscenes and open world gameplay (though not combat). Unsurprisingly, the frame rate is higher during cutscenes.</p>
<p>I tested it at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLAA enabled, and all settings (ray tracing included) set to max, as befitting the most powerful PC configuration currently available (Ryzen 7 9800X3D + <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>), and got a score of 21896 and an average frame rate of 127.98 frames per second. This is with the standard NVIDIA DLSS CNN model and x2 Frame Generation, as the game does not support DLSS 4 and/or Multi Frame Generation for the time being.</p>

<p>CAPCOM also shared updated PC requirements for each of the four graphics presets available in Monster Hunter Wilds. Using the high-resolution texture pack will require a graphics card with at least 16GB of VRAM.</p>

            <p>
EA has become one of the first publishers to discuss - in broad terms - its plans for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">now Nintendo has finally lifted the lid on its next console</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors last night following the release of its latest financial results, EA boss Andrew Wilson namechecked major franchises the company expected to find a home on Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past," Wilson said. 
</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"When you think about something like The Sims and MySims: Cozy Bundle, which performed well ahead of our expectations, 50 percent of all players were new to EA," he continued. "That represents a great opportunity for us."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 still lacks a release date, but with public hands-on events running in April and May, a summer launch seems likely. 
</p>
<p>
Could Switch 2 launch with the current <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>? Or might EA decide to hold off until this autumn's next installment?
</p>
<p>
It's easy to see EA releasing existing titles in The Sims series on the new console - perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">the new Sims 1+2 Bundle</a>? Could EA also make use of the Switch 2's mysterious mouse pointer functionality also?
</p>
<p>
And how about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>? EA could try and launch that on Switch 2 as a way to boost sales, after previously saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">the game had not met its own expectations</a>.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">there's the next Battlefield</a>. EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">still seems unsure exactly when it will land</a> (we may know more after Rockstar decides on a date for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>), but could Switch 2 have the horsepower to run that? It'll be intriguing to find out. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo is next set to discuss Switch 2 in April</a>, via a special Nintendo Direct laying out more detail on the upcoming console. We're expecting to hear a launch date and price then - as well as more information on the games we'll all be playing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">other than the next Mario Kart</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/mercy-mains-rejoice-with-the-return-of-overwatchs-moth-meta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re still absolutely addicted to Blizzard’s Overwatch 2, despite the shiny new pull of Marvel Rivals, then do we have some good news for you! Well, that is, if you’re a Mercy main and you’re not on an enemy team facing her. Anyway, Blizzard have announced the return of the ‘Moth Meta’ to the game, as part of the Overwatch Classic trawl through the game’s greatest hits/builds. </p>
<p><iframe title="When Mercy Broke Overwatch - The Moth Meta" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pubueAeyN8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What is the Moth Meta? It was Mercy’s chance to shine, by utterly breaking the game with her resurrection ability. It let Mercy players resurrect teammates instantly, use her ultimate to recharge the ability, and then get another two shots at resurrection while that was running. This was obviously a nightmare for enemy teams, and there’s probably a good reason that it’s not a thing anymore. But! It was a hell of a time, and now you can experience that same joy/frustration while the mode runs from now until the 17th of February.</p>
<p>What else are we getting? Well, Overwatch Classic continues to experiment with 6v6, and this time you can try it out with Min 1, Max 3 team compositions, experimenting with the way different Tanks, DPS and Healers can achieve success, without filling your team with 6 Tjorbörns. It’s a great question as to whether we’ll get a permanent 6v6 mode at the end of this, that’s both modern and fun to play, but it’s a fun little trip either way. </p>
<p>Besides that, Doomfist arrives as a DPS, and Symmetra is once more equipped with her Shield Generator, mixing up the way these characters play, and how you’re going to need to respond to them. You can do that on three classic maps too, with Oasis, Junkertown and Eichenwalde returning to rotation. </p>


<p>Otherwise, at this midpoint in Season 14, there’s the arrival of the Mythic Lead Rose Ashe weapon skin, which does look suitably cool, and with the end of the Year of the Snake celebrations we’re moving onto Valentines Day which will run from the 4th of February until the 18th, bringing with it Love of Geometry which sees teams of four cupid Hanzos fight for love and supremacy. How romantic!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard received strong reviews (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own</a>), but it failed to meet publisher Electronic Arts's sales expectations. This resulted in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job cuts at developer BioWare</a>, which now <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly has under a hundred staff members</a>, a worrying prospect for their upcoming Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Q3 2025 earnings call, Electronic Arts finally&nbsp;<span>discussed the launch's commercial failure. In a statement (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/electronic-arts-ea-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript via Fool.com</a>), CEO Andrew Wilson outlined that it was a high-quality game that</span>&nbsp;failed to captivate a large audience, partly because players 'increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement.'</p>
<p><em>Our blockbuster storytelling strategy is built on three strategic objectives: first, create an authentic story experience for the core audience; second, build innovative groundbreaking features; and third, emphasize high-quality launches across both PC and console. In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demand of players who increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category. Dragon Age: The Veilguard had a high-quality launch and was well-reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.</em></p>
<p>Later in the earnings call, Stuart Canfield, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Electronic Arts, added:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed, highlighting the competitive dynamics of the single-player RPG market. [...] Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players. The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources toward our most significant and highest potential opportunities.</em></p>
<p>The latter sentence is certainly worrying for fans of blockbuster single player games. It sounds like Electronic Arts might once again veer toward live service, and their previous attempts (like Anthem) were far from memorable. Still, the studio does have at least three single player games in production: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron Man game</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther game</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi series</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/metaverse-misadventure/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta%E2%80%99s-cto-says-the-metaverse-could-be-a-%E2%80%98legendary-misadventure%E2%80%99-as-total-loss-exceeds-60-billion.1100643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metaverse-misadventure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new report has released an internal memo from META’s CTO saying that 2025 could be a make-or-break year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>The memo, which was obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a> reportedly originates from November 2024, where META’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth told staff that 2025 is its “most critical” year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>In the memo Bosworth said, “”We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR [Metaverse],” he said. </p>



<p>He continued, “And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.”</p>



<p>As reported by Business Insider, Meta’s Reality Labs reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in Q4, however, it also had its biggest-ever quarterly loss of $4.97 billion. At the time of writing, the Meta Reality Labs division had accumulated a loss of $60 billion since 2020.</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> US video game industry spent $58.7 billion on games and hardware in 2024, a 1% decrease from 2023.</p>



<p>The full memo to employee’s reads:</p>



<p><strong><em>2025: The Year of Greatness</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Next year is going to be the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs. We have the best portfolio of products we’ve ever had in market and are pushing our advantage by launching half a dozen more AI powered wearables. We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR. And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve been re-reading “Insanely Great,” Steven Levy’s history of the Macintosh computer. If you haven’t read it the book chronicles the incredible efforts of individuals working in teams of 1-3 to build a device that more than any other marked the consumer era of personal computing. What I find most fascinating about it is the way that even people who left the program on bad terms (it was not particularly well managed) speak about the work they did there with an immense sense of pride. There was a widespread cultural expectation, set by none other than a young Steve Jobs, that the work needed to be “insanely great.”</em></p>



<p><em>On paper 2024 was our most successful year to date but we aren’t sitting around celebrating because know it isn’t enough. We haven’t actually made a dent in the world yet. The prize for good work is the opportunity to do great work.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is our opportunity.&nbsp;</strong>We live in an incredible time of technological achievement and have placed ourselves at the center of it with our investments.&nbsp;There is a very good chance most of us will never get a chance like this again.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is a choice.</strong>&nbsp;Many people have been at the precipice of opportunity and failed to achieve. For the most part they failed to even challenge themselves.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You should be doing the best work of your career right now.</strong>&nbsp;You should be pushing yourself to grow where needed and doubling down on your strengths. When you look back on this time I want you to feel like you did everything in your power to make the most of it.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You don’t need big teams to do great work.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, it may make it harder. One trend I’ve observed the last couple of years is that our smaller teams often go faster and achieve better results than our more generously funded teams. Not only that, they are much happier! In small teams there is no risk of falling into bad habits like design by committee. You should be so focused on results that being in a bunch of docs or meetings is too frustrating to bear.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>The path is clear.&nbsp;</strong>You don’t need to come up with a bunch of new ideas to do this great work. Most people in the organization just need to execute on the work laid out before them to succeed. It is about operational excellence. It is about master craftsmanship. It is about filling our products with “Give A Damn”.&nbsp;This is about having pride in our work.</em></p>



<p><em>I will close with an Arnold Glasow quote: “Success isn’t a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.” 2025 is the year. Let’s be on fire.</em></p>
