			<p>Ever thought to yourself that Ace Attorney, as a series, has far too much courtroom shenanigans and that the investigation segments felt bland and formulaic? Well, if you’re this very specific and hypothetical person, boy do I have the games for you: Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</p>
<p><iframe title="Ace Attorney Investigations Collection - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLFMaakr_xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest remastered game bundle, Ace Attorney Investigations Collection’s twinned games star fan favourite and cravat enthusiast Miles Edgeworth after the events of the third game in the main series, and they off with an investigation of several cases around an underground smuggling ring. As this is set in the same continuity of the main series, mainstays such as Dick Gumshoe return to support our prosecutor protagonist, with the addition of new characters such as the plucky “master thief” Kay Faraday.</p>


<p>Instead of trying to win a court case, the focus of the gameplay in each case is to unravel the mystery through a variety of investigative techniques. The simplest of these is exploring the crime scenes to gather evidence and talking to witnesses and your allies to uncover facts or questions about the case at hand. This evidence will then either take the form of tangible evidence or clue-like prompts, but more on those in a moment.</p>


<p>Some interactions with characters result in Rebuttals that see you hear a character’s&nbsp;testimony about the events, which can be a witness statement or a character’s opinion on what happened. You can press individual statements to garner more information, and then expose contradictions between what they say and the evidence by presenting the correct evidence. Do this successfully and you can garner more information and inch ever closer to the truth. Get it wrong and your little life bar in the top right takes a little hit while you regroup to try again.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar to you that’s because it is essentially a cross examination from the main series right down to the similar aesthetic flair of the cut-ins focusing on the eyes. But, if it ain’t broke, does it really need fixing?</p>
<p>Where the <span data-contrast="auto">Ace Attorney Investigations games</span>&nbsp;deviate is with the Logic mechanic. As I mentioned, you gather a variety of clue-like prompts related to the case as you investigate, which often relate to elements of the case that stand out oddly or question other aspects of the facts. Using Logic, you can piece together two of these clues to gather new information, which is a clever little wrinkle on Ace Attorney’s gameplay.</p>

<p>Like the Rebuttals, you get a penalty for getting these links wrong, but it’s incredibly satisfying when you nail it. Also, some of them lead to that classic Ace Attorney mainstay of turning your thinking entirely on its head. The only criticism I have from the early cases I’ve been able to play for this preview is that these do tend to be a little easy to work out.</p>
<p>This criticism – in fact – I would extend to the whole experience so far. It might change as I go deeper into each game, but nothing I’ve seen so far hasn’t really been a challenge to get through. Though, I must admit, sometimes an easier game is hugely welcome.</p>

<p>A big thing for this release that I have made a concerted effort to check out is the revised visuals and sound. The collection has had new HD visuals of the characters created, and you can switch between the original sprites and these new models in the Options menu. To be honest, the sprites have held up well and I find the chibi-like style of the HD models a little off putting, but the option to switch between the styles is great.</p>
<p>The revised soundtrack is also pretty good and allows the same option to switch back and forth between it and the classic version for the discerning gentleman prosecutor. Also, this collection has the trimmings that these collections have generally had, such as a Gallery, but I’ve not delved too deeply into the bonus content here to avoid spoilers on how to receive the accolades for achieving specific criteria in the games.</p>
<p>At my current point in the games, this shaping up as another excellent collection from the Ace Attorney series, especially as it brings the first of the two games to the West for the first time. It’s also good to see Edgeworth display the discerning eye and quick wit that was only hinted at with a superb (but unevidenced) ego in the main series. I’m looking forward to getting deeper into the core mysteries of both <span data-contrast="auto">Ace Attorney Investigations</span> games and – hopefully – I’ll have more of a challenge getting to the truth of them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-demanding-540p-xbox-series-s/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Unreal Engine 5 continues to prove extremely demanding for current consoles, leading to extremely low resolutions and visual cutbacks on the weakest current generation console, the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>In a new video shared online yesterday, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the Marvel Rivals beta's technical features, visuals, and performance on consoles and PC. Regarding some of the engine's defining features, the beta uses Lumen Global Illumination on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X but falls back to screen space reflections instead of the Lumen Reflections available in the PC version. This choice was most likely made to keep the performance as steady as possible without dropping the resolution too low.</p>
<p>On both systems, the beta runs at dynamic 1440p resolution, with the resolution dropping as low as 810p. The beta fares much worse on the Xbox Series S, with major cutbacks in visual features, such as the removal of Lumen Global Illumination, screen-space reflections, and character shadows, and lower quality textures for both character models and environments, and a lower target resolution, dynamic 972p, which can go as low as 540p to maintain the 60 frames per second target. On all platforms, performance is stable 95% of the time, but that 5% is really felt, according to Digital Foundry, as there's stuttering and hitches when moving around the map, something that has sadly become expected in Unreal Engine 5 games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals Hands-On - PS5/Xbox Series/PC - Can Unreal Engine 5 Deliver A Locked 60FPS?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENOAc_mN5gg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The more time passes, the more it becomes evident how current gaming hardware is not ready for the Unreal Engine 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-native-4k-challenge-rtx-4080/">Last week</a>, a video highlighted how the RTX 4080 GPU, one of the best GPUs on the market, has trouble running most games powered by the engine at framerates higher than 30 FPS. The fact that most of these games did not employ Lumen and Nanite makes the whole situation even more troubling, although Epic is constantly updating the engine with performance optimization and improvements.</p>
<p>More on the Unreal Engine 5 latest version, version 5.4, can be found on its official website.</p>

While it’s the cheapest game on the list, I think it’s the one PS Plus players will be most pleasantly surprised by. It’s a 2D action side-scroller with RPG elements that mixes light metroidvania and Soulsborne influences. You play as the last priestess in a land filled with grim death, who collects spirits which give her special abilities to solve puzzles and overcome bosses. The art style is neat, if occasionally messy, and the piano music is excellent. </p><p>It’s the lesser <em>Hollow Knight</em>-like you probably didn’t know you needed in your life. A sequel called <em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em> is currently in Early Access on Steam. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steamworld-heist-2-review.942168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steamworld-heist-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s kind of an odd shift for a sequel to go from an outer space setting to a nautical one, but SteamWorld games have never shied away from being kind of odd. In fact, it’s their whole thing. There are direct connections between the silly swashbuckling story of SteamWorld Heist 2 and the original from 2015, but those take a while to show up – instead, much of Heist 2 feels completely separate as it gives you control of a submarine and a crew full of goofy robots in a colorfully cartoony ocean. This adventure takes place on a surprisingly large overworld map that’s packed with so many tough and tactically deep turn-based missions and lighter side activities that burning through them all took me around 40 hours. </p><p>The plot that ensues is appropriately light and fun, revolving around our borderline-competent one-armed captain, Quincy Leeway. He’s trying to escape the shadow of his famous mother and gathering a crew to discover the source of a rusty corruption that’s poisoning the water. I wouldn’t call any of the surprises shocking or its characters especially memorable (I suspect they’d be easier to love if their dialogue were fully voiced) but its robotic heart is firmly in the right place. </p><p>What <em>is</em> memorable is the music, for which the relentlessly charming band Steam Powered Giraffe returns with 15 delightfully catchy original songs that play when you’re visiting taverns between missions. I often found myself hanging around a little longer than I needed to in order to let them finish a verse about how nice it is to be a robot before heading back to my ship.</p><p>SteamWorld Heist 2’s 2D turn-based tactical gameplay is very similar to the original, but the controls are notably smoother (albeit still a little wonky on mouse and keyboard). Moving your team of one to five bots (depending on the mission) around a side-scrolling level to line up shots and snag loot within their two-action turns is a tricky challenge of efficiency, and having to escape an endlessly increasing stream of enemies as you complete a specific objective rather than just trying to clear the map gives a lot of missions a thrilling finale.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Manual aiming gives it a little more life than a lot of turn-based games.</p></div><p>The fact that all of the aiming is done manually by raising or lowering the angle of your bots’ gun arms – in the style of the classic Worms games – gives it a little more life than a lot of turn-based games. It’s pretty hilarious to watch the projected path of a shot from a piercing sniper rifle as you slide it around until it passes through several enemies, then let it fly at the right moment of its gently wobbling sway. That said, you’d have to be a geometric savant to predict what multiple bank shots you’ll be able to line up without moving somewhere first and seeing where the guideline ends up pointing, so a lot of those feel like random lucky rewards rather than something earned. I do feel pretty proud of myself when I successfully land a ricochet shot to hit an enemy behind cover using a weapon that doesn’t have the guideline, though.</p><p>Each character starts with a native class that you level up, but you’re strongly encouraged to turn them all into hybrid beasts that mix and match abilities from the six different trees. It’s a very smart and flexible system once you get going, though a lot of that unlocking process, which requires a bot to run missions with each class’s signature weapon type, feels obligatory. You’d be foolish, for instance, to not unlock the first-tier powers of the Sniper and the Boomer on just about everybody: the former allows you to use a Perfect Aim ability that puts a prediction line on any weapon and removes sway, and the latter lets you equip a third inventory item. And I must say, an upgrade you can buy relatively early on that unlocks the first two full tiers of a class’s skills after using it for just one mission made me seriously regret how I’d chosen to spread my experience points thin up to that point. </p><p>Once things get rolling and you can combine the best skills from each tree with the 10 bots’ unique special abilities, there are a lot of extremely powerful and satisfying tricks you can pull. Moving around the 2D maps is a snap when Beacon can teleport anywhere you’ve seen (with a three-turn cooldown timer), and pairing that with a good brawler’s hammer means there’s no one he can’t smash for high damage. Chimney’s Tit for Tat ability deals damage to anyone who hits her, and that goes very well with the Pain Amulet item that does the same thing because the effects stack. Hightower’s Abs of Steel ability makes him invulnerable and forces every enemy to attack him that turn – which is excellent for, among other things, buying some time for your crew to make a getaway.</p><p>Notably, SteamWorld Heist 2 does away with some of the original’s annoyances, such as a tightly limited inventory system and procedurally generated levels that felt samey after a bit. These multi-chambered stages are all hand-built around their objectives, and you can keep as much of your loot on hand as you like (though there’s no way to level up early-game items, so a lot of it becomes obsolete junk you have to sell off). There are a good amount of legendary weapons that come with unique modifiers, like a melee hammer that gives you extra damage to your sidearm pistol or a sniper rifle that inflicts burning damage, and I often found myself changing up my tactics to take advantage of a new one. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are a lot of variables to consider and threats to prioritize on every mission.</p></div><p>Toward the end of the campaign I’d cranked up the difficulty a couple of notches to keep the enemies competitive with my heavy-hitting teams. (Difficulty can be fine-tuned to your liking on the fly with different sliders for the tactical and real-time modes, as well as a few other options.) Of course, each mission is thoughtfully designed with layers to it beyond simply accomplishing the main objective with your last bot limping out the door with a sliver of health, enemies nipping at their heels. Getting the maximum rating means you’ll have to come back for another run and go for getting all your bots out alive, then do that while also grabbing all of the loot bags (including the one bit of epic loot), and <em>then </em>do the bonus objective – which can be things like hitting multiple switches during the same turn, killing three enemies by dropping stuff on them, or taking out turrets it’d be easier to dash past on your way to the door. Boss fights also put clever spins on the mechanics and challenge you to deal with multiple problems at once as you’re disabling defenses and bashing away to inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>Enemy variety is another strong point. The Rattlers are especially neat looking, in that their designs are differentiated from the more typical junkyard androids of the Navy by the fact that they’ve replaced their metal parts with rust-proof ones made of bone (it is unclear where the bones came from). It can be a little tricky to distinguish some of your own bots from the similarly steam-powered Navy enemies until you get to know them better, but with several sets of melee, ranged, and special enemies (like the Rattler who drops totems that can hit your team with elemental damage every turn if you don’t take them out) there are a lot of variables to consider and threats to prioritize on every mission.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>SteamWorld Heist 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If that sounds overwhelming, know that there are zero consequences for failing a mission – you just try again (with no fee to repair your bots like in the first SteamWorld Heist). You can also reload a checkpoint from two turns back, so while you can save-scum your way through a mission it’s not quite as easy as undoing the one bad move you just made. Considering there’s no real way to know and plan for what type of bot will be best suited for a mission before you dive in, it’s for the best that failure is very much an option.</p><p>Of course, there’s basically a whole second, totally different game built around that idea, which you play as you travel from mission to mission. Where the first SteamWorld Heist’s overworld map is something akin to Super Mario World’s connected nodes, this one is an open-world game unto itself, if a relatively simple and two-dimensional one. The map itself is surprisingly large, and there are plenty of side challenges to engage in to reach treasure chests in which you have to navigate currents or run gauntlets with guns firing on you from both sides. Puttering around this expansive maze of waterways is a nice, lighter break from the turn-based tactics; tangling with enemy watercraft, running occasional obstacle courses, and unlocking routes and shortcuts with new abilities is quite a bit shallower than the main event, but it definitely has a few tense moments because you can’t replenish your sub’s health without docking and ending your day, and getting sunk means losing all your booty. I especially like occasionally coming across battles between fleets of ships from the two main enemy factions going at it and cleaning up the wreckage after I finish them off – that kind of thing puts a little bit of life and spontaneity into what’s otherwise a pretty static world.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dan's favorite tactics games</h3></p></div><p>You can only cruise around for so long, though, because each bot is good for one mission per day. In order to maximize your return before coming in to dock for the night you’ll want to look for mission combos that let you use up everybody on your current roster, which might mean replaying a mission or two. That said, there doesn’t seem to be a time limit or anything, so if you wanted to you could simply do one mission every day and just use the same squad for nearly everything. But that’d be boring (and would leave some of your crew underleveled).</p><p>Combat with boats and other subs is along the lines of “bullet heaven” games like Vampire Survivors, in that your sub fires automatically (as long as a target is within its weapon arcs) while you focus on steering out of the way of incoming cannonballs and torpedoes. There’s certainly some skill to approaching enemies outside of their gun arcs and spinning to line up all of yours, and it gets a little deeper once you unlock the ability to boost your engines and submerge (see what I did there?). SteamWorld Heist 2 does a reliable job of rolling out upgrades to prevent both combat and the satisfying act of uncovering the map’s fog of war from becoming too one-note over the course of three dozen hours. There aren’t a ton of different enemy types to battle out here, but you’ll see enough destroyers, battleships, skiffs, and subs – and find better guns, engine boosters, armor, and the like to upgrade your sub with – to keep things interesting.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Developing games for Apple platforms has been described as "like an abusive relationship", due to a lack of support or strategy.
</p>
<p>
In a new report, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/">MobileGamer.biz</a> has spoken to a number of anonymous developers making games for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> mobile platform and the Vision Pro VR headset.
</p>
<p>
Sources describe a whole litany of issues, suggesting Apple simply "does not understand gamers" or the industry.

<p>

A key problem is reportedly a lack of contact or technical support. "We can go weeks without hearing from Apple at all and their general response time to emails is three weeks, if they reply at all," said one source.
</p>
<p>
"We're supposed to be able to ask product, technical and commercial questions, but often half the Apple team won't turn up and when they do they have no idea what's going on and can't answer our questions, either because they don't have any knowledge on how to answer it, or are not able to share that info for confidentiality reasons."
</p>
<p>
This is particularly apparent for developers working on Vision Pro, with one developer describing Apple's technical support as "the worst I have seen anywhere".
</p>
<p>
"Developing for Vision Pro is like going back in time 10 years because despite the advertised power - and the cost - it is not a machine built for gaming," they said. "Getting any complex games working on the platform is difficult."
</p>
<p>
Apple also does not offer financial incentives for studios to develop for Vision Pro, unlike its main rival Meta, which was described as "utterly baffling" by an anonymous developer.
</p>
<p>
Other problems include discoverability on Apple Arcade, and grim QA and update processes. Said one source: "It feels like the game's been in a morgue for the last two years... It's like we're invisible."
</p>
<p>
Another developer detailed the QA and localisation process, which involves submitting a thousand screenshots at once for every device aspect ratio and language. "My team were like: there's no fucking way we're going to do that," they said.
</p>
<p>
On the plus side, the interviewed sources stated Apple does pay well, although times have changed since the first few years of Arcade. Now, however, there's a five month backlog on royalty payments - one developer had not been paid for six months and nearly went out of business, while another said they had been "stonewalled" by Apple reps for chasing payments.
</p>
<p>
And while developers believe Apple sees games as a 'necessary evil', Arcade seems to be directionless. One source said it "feels like a bolt-on to the Apple company ecosystem" and isn't "truly supported inside the company".
</p>
<p>
"Honestly, I think Apple doesn't understand games and gamers," said another source. "I believe Apple Arcade is a good idea in general, but they need a clear goal for where it should go and what it is for. That's a question they need to answer and then act accordingly."
</p>
<p>
Another source was particularly disgruntled. "Given their status as a huge tech company it feels as if they treat developers as a necessary evil, and that we will do everything we can to please them for little in return, in the hope that they grace us with another project - and a chance for them to screw us over again," they said.
</p>
<p>
"It's like an abusive relationship where the abused stays in the relationship hoping the other partner will change and become the person you know they could be."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer requested comment from Apple, which it declined but did point to an interview with Arcade's senior director Alex Rofman in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/apr/23/apple-arcade-future-alex-rofman-interview">The Guardian</a>. "Arcade is a place for games that might not otherwise exist, and I think that's a really important part of our strategy," he said, adding "games are more important to Apple now than they ever have been."
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-concerned-about-apple-arcade-future-report">previous report in February</a>, also from MobileGamer.biz, stated developers were concerned about the future of Apple Arcade and described "the smell of death" around the platform.

</p>
<p>
It's certainly a tricky time for mobile gaming. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">Capcom's iOS port of Resident Evil 7 has reportedly made under 2000 sales</a> since its launch at the start of July. The likes of Assassin's Creed Mirage, Resident Evil Village, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> have fared similarly.

In a quick but informative scene, we learn that she’s staying with a man Rodney doesn’t approve of. He offers to help financially, but she promises she’s got a good life and is happy. Distraught, he asks to stay and even offers to pay rent, but she denies him because her partner, Rick, is not approving. The implication is that Rodney’s white mother chooses this new person and new family over him, her biracial son, motivates Rodney to reunite with Michael and the other superheroes.<br></p><h2 id="h1345"><a id=""></a>You’re being watched</h2><p>Throughout the series, we’ve seen an experimental facility in which a white man oversees the superheroes and Black captives behind bars. In this episode, we learn that he and his staff have been actively tracking the main characters, and that he takes a special interest upon learning four of them have been in the same location concurrently. The facility gets more cut scenes this episode, emphasizing how they are invasively tracking the superheroes.</p><p>Whenever multiple heroes are in proximity of each other, the people in the facility take notice. Because community social worker and Michael’s fiancee Dionne doesn’t have superpowers, she’s able to operate under the radar as she investigates disappearances.<br></p><p>We continue to see the devastating impact of Sickle Cell Disease as Michael’s mother experiences a crisis. He stays overnight at the Sickle Cell Center, then decides to tell Dionne the truth about the future and her possible murder, as he learned about it by visiting the future the first time he used his powers in the initial episode. He laments being unable to change the outcome of her death, even when given some of the information he might need to do so.. The disproportionate presence of Sickle Cell Disease in Black communities, the lack of support for patients and families struggling with this disease, and Michael’s perceived inability to change outcomes for both his mother and Dionne represents a large picture in the struggle of the Black communities represented in the show, and the greater human experience – it’s like always swimming against the current.<br></p><p>As we now know, the Sickle Cell gene is also related to the superpowers the characters have, exposing pain in a more chronic way, and bringing characters together to heal.<br></p><p>Investigating the disappearance of Jasmine, Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo) tracks down her parents. She learns that Jasmine’s father has Sickle Cell Disease, but Jasmine was able to heal his pain using her superpowers. Brought back together by Michael’s mother’s health crisis, Dionne and Michael get a chance to talk – but they’re interrupted by Rodney, who insists Michael leaves now.<br></p><p>This is hard to watch. Michael has been on a quest to be there for everyone, save everyone, and do the right thing, and he drops the ball. Instead of telling Rodney he needs to hold on a moment, Michael abandons Dionne, delaying off their big conversation.</p><h2 id="h1346"><a id=""></a><em>Supacell </em>and women characters</h2><p>This could have been an opportunity for Michael to be truthful, but instead he falls short, and for a weak reason.. In the beginning of the series, Michael was so easy to root for. But like many of the male characters, he treats women as an afterthought if not an object, and this makes it hard to believe he’s going to act with responsibility in the future–even though he can see the future himself. </p><p>My assumption is that his failure to warn Dionne or be honest with her will lead to her death, making her a plot point and another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenInRefrigerators&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenInRefrigerators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fridged female character</a></span> in superhero history, because having a motivational tragedy for Michael is more important than having him treat his fiancee with respect. I hope the show moves in a better direction, but it isn’t looking good in conjunction with Sharleen’s (Rayxia Ojo) abuse becoming her personality in addition to a plot point. Taze (Josh Tedeku), meanwhile, potentially murders a woman in broad daylight, leading him to be a less redeemable character by the minute.<br></p><p>Sharleen’s constant dive into danger overshadows Sabrina’s (Nadine Mills) good news. Here, however, it’s not careless writing buried in tropes, but it’s clearly meant to be an injustice that Sabrina’s career achievement is overshadowed by abuse and violence.<br></p><p>The male characters in the show are constantly examined, judged, and captured by systems in society. In truth, most of them don’t trust each other, which is why it takes so long for Michael and Rodney to get Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa) to trust him and consider joining the team. And even then, Rodney only wants to help Michael because he thinks Michael can and will rewind time to help his injured friend. The overarching power structures intentionally damage the trust and the Black community. But it’s clear the women suffer most, and the men can’t break free of the cycle of both receiving and perpetuating unfairness.<br></p><p>Overall, this episode should have had more like pieces come together, but instead the storytelling was disjointed and it fell flat. Hopefully, the final episode packs more of a punch when it comes to connectedness, or permits Michael to use his powers to access the past in a way that changes the story and empowers all of the characters, including Dionne.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-strange-scaffold-interview-with-xalavier-nelson-jr">Strange Scaffold Interview with Xalavier Nelson Jr.</h2>



<h3 id="h-where-is-the-time-coming-from-to-create-all-these-different-types-of-games">Where is the time coming from to create all these different types of games?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr:</strong><em><strong> </strong>It’s just different priorities.&nbsp;I remember when a game studio, even say from software would launch one, two, three&nbsp;games a year, Activision, if you look back 10 years back in, or even at this&nbsp;point, 20 years back to like 2004, Activision would publish something&nbsp;like 20, 30 games in a year.&nbsp;Now they update their live service games and they might have one or two.</em></p>



<p><em>And those changes in how we release and make games and the priorities we have&nbsp;along the way, a single game, partially because it keeps getting updated, has to&nbsp;generate more revenue, which means more microtransactions for players, which&nbsp;means more exploitative game loops that get you caught up in this being the one&nbsp;game you play, all those things have an impact on the developers, but very much&nbsp;also the player experience.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>When you change the process, you change the project and Strange Scaffold, we’re&nbsp;just trying to provide people with the next game they didn’t know they needed.&nbsp;And those priorities, those very player centric thing of, you didn’t know you&nbsp;needed a dark fantasy horror kidnapping sim. </em></p>



<p><em>So here it is.&nbsp;Here’s an open world comedy adventure game, entirely stock by stock photos&nbsp;that makes most of the people who play it cry.&nbsp;Here’s a game that brings back Max Payne, because we haven’t done that. No one, we’re bringing back the boomer shooter, which is great, but no one’s&nbsp;bringing back Max Payne, no one’s bringing back those classic third person&nbsp;shooters. We make games in a different way, which lets us explore games with&nbsp;different priorities and bring new things to the table.&nbsp;So Clickolding into I Am Your Beast is one of the clearest, I think, examples of&nbsp;when we release I Am Your Beast, we’ll have released 15 games in five years. </em></p>



<p><em>And it’s just because we want to make sure that players are seeing something new and&nbsp;exciting on a consistent basis.&nbsp;And even if it makes less money than a Fortnite, knowing that at this point,&nbsp;we’re one of a smaller group of people exploring that territory means that we&nbsp;kind of have to do it.&nbsp;Otherwise, the medium of art and experiences that I love becomes more and more like&nbsp;hash machines in digital form.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-you-come-up-with-the-different-premises-for-these-games">How do you come up with the different premises for these games?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>At this point, it’s mostly my brain, although something I really believe in is&nbsp;making sure that the way the game is developed allows a lot of other people to&nbsp;bring their voices into it to make it better than the sum of its parts.</em></p>



<p><em>A lot of the best pieces of El Paso elsewhere, because a level designer inspired&nbsp;by the vision and direction of the game did something weird or Romero Bonicaus in&nbsp;the primary programming design collaborator I had on the project said, hey, can we do&nbsp;this? That’s where the wall bounce came from.&nbsp;He was like, hey, I found a bug, but I want to keep it.&nbsp;Is this OK? And he jumped and he bounced off of a nearby wall because of a change we&nbsp;had made in the movement code. </em></p>



<p><em>So he had basically found a way to basically do a double jump with a with a combat&nbsp;dive, getting more air to take down enemies while you’re falling in slow motion.&nbsp;I said, no, that’s it.&nbsp;That’s it. That’s in.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>And that’s where I think auteurship, there’s a lot of discussion that’s happened&nbsp;around it in film and in games.&nbsp;I think that’s where auteurship can be at its best is when it can provide something&nbsp;so strong that it facilitates other people to do things. But yeah, the the the ideas do mainly come from my head.&nbsp;And a lot of it is saying both what is a thing that can be made?&nbsp;Yes, but also what makes it make sense, because a game like click holding, unless it&nbsp;has a very specific scope and efficiency of design, it doesn’t make sense to make&nbsp;it. No one is coming into twenty twenty four saying one of the sensational horror&nbsp;games of the summer is going to be the game where you click for a guy in a click&nbsp;chair</em>.</p>

<h3 id="h-creating-games-that-can-tell-a-story-or-accomplish-a-goal">Creating games that can tell a story or accomplish a goal?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>The idea that regardless of that specter, if it was haunting my&nbsp;nightmares, I wouldn’t make a game about that character or that world unless I also&nbsp;knew exactly what we were trying to accomplish with it and how it provided value to a&nbsp;player’s life.</em></p>



<p><em>I think it’s why strange scaffold stands out, because there’s people&nbsp;who make games very quickly.&nbsp;There’s people who make there’s a lot of people who make really high quality games.&nbsp;But the fact that we’re saying, hey, efficiency and quality are not opposing sides of&nbsp;the spectrum.</em></p>



<p><em>They are just one there.&nbsp;They can be taken as one way to facilitate making experience you never could&nbsp;otherwise. It’s something that means a space warlord organ shredding simulator gets made&nbsp;in the first place, because if you’re just looking for how to maximize profit or what’s&nbsp;selling right now, you don’t have the tools to find your players next favorite game,&nbsp;which is one of the interesting things about how our ultimate set of partnerships came&nbsp;about for that game was we had pitched Space Warlord to a lot of people and everyone&nbsp;either stalled the conversation or was just like, I’m not sure about this.</em></p>



<p><em>Then we did our own reveal trailer and because we were like, you know, we’re not going&nbsp;to. We’re not going to wait for the rest of the industry to catch up to us, we did it&nbsp;for Dog Airport game. We were talking about development from the beginning.</em></p>



<p><em>And so for Space Warlord, we tried to go dark and do things the right way.&nbsp;It didn’t do anything special.&nbsp;So we were like, screw it.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re going to we aren’t going to let the rest of the industry, especially since we&nbsp;can’t finish it under our own power.&nbsp;We’re going to let them determine whether or not this game gets made.&nbsp;And we put our own announcement trailer.</em></p>



<p><em>And suddenly all those people are writing back and we end up eventually on things like&nbsp;Game Pass, but only after we had kind of stepped out front and&nbsp;proved this is a game that deserves to get made.&nbsp;Oh, you feel weird about organs?&nbsp;Oh, no. How will players not like that?&nbsp;You have to show it to them in the first place.</em></p>



<p><em>We are as an industry in a place where people are terrified to even give players&nbsp;something to like, let alone dislike.&nbsp;Yeah. What if it’s not like Lethal Company?&nbsp;What if it’s not like Civilization?&nbsp;What if it’s not like Change Together or whatever is the current du jour of the&nbsp;industry? So, yeah, I give a lot of props to my fellow developers.</em></p>



<p><em>And I think there’s a lot of amazing work still being done in the medium.&nbsp;It is contrary to what some commentators might say.&nbsp;It’s not a hotbed of exploitation, even for projects with really messed up microtransaction models. There’s a lot of developers who love players who are doing&nbsp;good work on those projects and trying to do their little part to make experiences&nbsp;better. </em></p>



<p><em>But Strange Scaffold, we have managed to carve out a place for&nbsp;ourselves where we work so efficiently that the rest of the industry can’t tell&nbsp;us no. And I’m very thankful for that because we kind of ended up here by&nbsp;accident.</em></p>

<h3 id="h-what-was-the-inspiration-behind-i-am-your-beast">What was the inspiration behind I Am Your Beast?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>A lot of it was, again, kind of seeing gaps where the rest of the industry was either&nbsp;not following down a path or it’s determined that a path wasn’t worth following anymore.&nbsp;Like things like Max Payne and debt to rights in the Die Hard trilogy on PS1 for the real OGs out&nbsp;there.&nbsp;And for I Am Your Beast, it was looking at, OK, a lot of people are going into this tactical&nbsp;space, that kind of Tom Clancy early 2000s era Splinter Cell Ghost Recon space and satisfying&nbsp;the nostalgia there.</em></p>



<p><em>But that’s kind of where the conversation and the thought process stops.&nbsp;We have a lot of games that are emerging that are following down the same paths.&nbsp;And the paths are cool when they’re doing something unique for it and they’re satisfying&nbsp;players.</em></p>



<p><em>But there’s nothing new being explored there.&nbsp;They’re not saying, you loved Ghost Recon.&nbsp;Here’s what comes next.</em></p>



<p><em>And the idea of comic book Doom guy in a Tom Clancy setting, what happens when you have&nbsp;someone who can jump kick people so hard their heads explode when greeted with what would&nbsp;otherwise be a kind of po-faced military combat gameplay space.&nbsp;It was something that was deeply enticing, even going back to the efficiency of it all,&nbsp;saying, hey, if it’s all happening in a bit of an arctic tundra, then that means that we&nbsp;can reuse a lot of things because it’s all just covered in snow.&nbsp;You can reuse levels and level concepts and you can pull really interesting things about&nbsp;this.</em></p>



<p><em>We have a level that’s called Burning Crescent, which is basically a giant pit.&nbsp;And in the center is a sniper tower that’s overlooking you at a bunch of different points.&nbsp;And you’re bouncing around between points of cover while taking out enemies as quickly as&nbsp;possible.</em></p>



<p><em>And right before you hit the finish, there is a point where you can veer off and get a&nbsp;lower level time.&nbsp;But you can take out that gosh dang sniper who’s been harassing you for the entire level,&nbsp;even though it’s only been roughly 30 seconds.&nbsp;And that idea of very instant catharsis and pursuit.</em></p>



<p><em>And again, frenetic things applied to a tactical military setting that could very easily just&nbsp;be overdone or bland.&nbsp;That’s where we live.&nbsp;We don’t just make the game you’ve seen before.</em></p>



<p><em>We say, what can we provide inside of that same space?&nbsp;If we’re doing a Max Payne, if that’s noir, what does that look like when it’s neo-noir?&nbsp;What does it look like when we’re playing sick hip hop beats over you shooting a werewolf&nbsp;in slow motion?&nbsp;And we didn’t expect it to do as well as it did.&nbsp;We thought we knew we had made a good thing.&nbsp;But partially just out of realism, we never believe anything will be a hit before it happens.</em></p>



<p><em>So seeing the wildly enthusiastic response to it and knowing that you don’t get to an&nbsp;I Am Your Beast without throwing out a lot of stuff in the process and doing those games&nbsp;justice too.&nbsp;It’s just made us more confident in our approach of saying, hey, regardless of how well I Am&nbsp;Your Beast does, we’re not going to make it a slot machine three years from now.&nbsp;You know that within six to nine months, you’re going to have another strange scaffold game&nbsp;that’s going to give you another thing you didn’t know you needed.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-how-do-you-blend-chaotic-gameplay-with-a-compelling-story">How do you blend chaotic gameplay with a compelling story?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>I think something that we’ve lost consideration of in games is that we see quality&nbsp;as just like a linear trajectory.&nbsp;It’s just a straight arrow going up.&nbsp;If you have a cut scene and then you have four realistic characters in the cut scene&nbsp;and each little notch up, the game just gets better.</em></p>



<p><em>I think over time, we’ve lost or really never had the vocabulary to understand when you&nbsp;use different tools, you get to have a different impact.&nbsp;So El Paso, Elsewhere thrives because it has really cinematic cut scenes.&nbsp;We have over 40 minutes of fully voiced, fully animated, lush cut scenes that immerse you&nbsp;in this world and in this character.</em></p>



<p><em>And I Am Your Beast, we went with a kinetic text style for the cut scenes.&nbsp;So if you’ve ever seen a video on YouTube of either a comedic or dramatic thing where&nbsp;words are coming in and slamming into the screen and coming in different arrangements&nbsp;with different backgrounds.&nbsp;In traditional games industry terms, it’s like, oh, that’s a downgrade from El Paso&nbsp;Elsewhere’s cut scenes because you don’t have 3D characters in a space.</em></p>



<p><em>But because you don’t have visuals, you just have words and audio, your brain stays locked&nbsp;into the space of the previous level you’re in.&nbsp;You’re still angry.&nbsp;You’re still ready to fuck a dude up and you have nothing pulling you out of that flow&nbsp;visually until you go into the next level and you’re right in the middle of it.</em></p>



<p><em>You’re right back into it again.&nbsp;And the idea that every game, every single thing in a game is an opportunity to say,&nbsp;does this pull focus where it needs to be?&nbsp;Does this give the player a better experience?&nbsp;Does this give the player a space to either rest if rest is required or to get amplified&nbsp;if what you need to do is turn them up a notch?&nbsp;I think the lack of really intentional discussion and how those tools come to be and how we&nbsp;use them is part of why we’ve ended up right now in a time where we have the most expensive&nbsp;games that have ever been made.&nbsp;And people might not care about the entire thing.</em></p>



<p><em>They might only care about 10% of that thing.&nbsp;And the idea that you can have a game that costs $500 million and players care about&nbsp;5% of it because all of those tools are not angled towards a very specific purpose to&nbsp;do and say something and give the player something really specific.&nbsp;I think it just is a source of dissonance that I really want to see confronted because&nbsp;I want every game I play to hit me as hard as humanly possible in the way it’s trying&nbsp;to hit me.</em></p>



<p><em>And when we, as an industry, see the only things that determine quality to be, is it&nbsp;going up that bar of fidelity?&nbsp;Can you see the cloth move on a character’s body?&nbsp;Then we also lose the ability to even ask for the things that will give us a better&nbsp;experience.&nbsp;So every game at Strange Scaffold, we’re saying, where do we pull back on scope or fidelity&nbsp;because it makes the game better?&nbsp;Where do we put time and energy and sometimes weeks of focus to pull off something really&nbsp;special that gets the ability to be highlighted because it is the star of the experience?&nbsp;How difficult can that be to make sure that everything that you guys are building for&nbsp;a specific game stays on that trajectory to where everything matters?&nbsp;Obviously, there’s times where there’s something in a game, it doesn’t work.&nbsp;It has to go.</em></p>

<h3 id="h-how-do-you-figure-out-what-works-in-a-strange-scaffold-game">How do you figure out what works in a Strange Scaffold game?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr</strong>: <em>I think it is having, to a degree, the luxury as a team to say that we’re going to have a&nbsp;focus.&nbsp;It’s part of the reason why we’ve struggled so much with getting funding in the past is&nbsp;we come to, say, a publisher, and we say, hey, here’s the game, and here’s where it’s&nbsp;going to be focused.&nbsp;And here’s other pieces in the game that are important, and they’re all going to work&nbsp;towards this.</em></p>



<p><em>And in fact, because there’s less going towards them, we can make that focus brighter.&nbsp;But we aren’t going to kill ourselves to put money or time into a place where it isn’t&nbsp;going to directly benefit the player’s experience.&nbsp;Publishers get really leery of that perspective, of focus.</em></p>



<p><em>They see games not as a space of where you can give players something, but as a space&nbsp;to avoid something that will make a player angry.&nbsp;It’s like, oh, what if players are upset that you don’t see the characters in 3D who&nbsp;are talking?&nbsp;It’s like, well, what you get to instead have is an audio drama, which has an entirely&nbsp;different effect, which supports this and this and this.&nbsp;And they’re like, oh, but I don’t know.</em></p>



<p><em>So a lot of people passed on I Am Your Beast.&nbsp;Everyone, actually.&nbsp;And it was FrostyPop who looked at what we were doing there, and the game had actually&nbsp;been canceled twice internally.</em></p>



<p><em>The first time because we didn’t have the bandwidth we were focusing on other projects,&nbsp;and the second time because we needed to make sure the studio survived to ship El Paso&nbsp;elsewhere.&nbsp;It was FrostyPop who resurrected it and said, we know that you make games that matter,&nbsp;and games that make choices, and games that hit players.&nbsp;I think that this will make a splash.</em></p>



<p><em>So that game got to exist.&nbsp;But that type of focus, the type of focus that results in games like  Kunitsu-Gami recently,&nbsp;where it’s like, man, this is like a PS2 experience.&nbsp;It only has the budget in the places where the game needs it.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s wild that that’s the place where games exist in 2024.&nbsp;It’s kind of like the old era of games back in the Xbox 360 era, where people were shoving&nbsp;in multiplayer on every game because they were forced to.&nbsp;Even if it detracted from or pulled resources from the single player experience, and it&nbsp;wasn’t the intention of the project, and it resulted in a lot of dead servers.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re kind of there now, but specifically in the sense of, oh man, if you don’t have&nbsp;X or Y or Z, if you don’t have Steam trading cards ready at launch, then players won’t&nbsp;care.&nbsp;They won’t love the game.&nbsp;We question that assumption, and we’ve been very thankful to find players going with us&nbsp;on that journey.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-going-right-the-most-that-helps-with-the-growth-of-strange-scaffold">What is going right the most that helps with the growth of Strange Scaffold?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr: </strong><em>I mean, I think there’s the grace of God, of course,&nbsp;but there’s also the fact that it was intentional.&nbsp;We apply game design to games&nbsp;and we’re really good as an industry&nbsp;at doing that at this point.&nbsp;We know that if you adjust a piece of even,&nbsp;say the color of a UI element,&nbsp;then it will change the player’s experience,&nbsp;but we just don’t apply that to production cycles.</em></p>



<p><em>So from the beginning, what I was telling people&nbsp;who even joined the studio or prospective publishers&nbsp;was Strange Scaffold doesn’t wanna sell people one game.&nbsp;We wanna sell them five.&nbsp;We wanna be presenting the type of artistic approach&nbsp;they can get behind,&nbsp;like their favorite director and musician,&nbsp;where even if you don’t love&nbsp;the latest Martin Scorsese film,&nbsp;you probably go and see it&nbsp;because it’s a Martin Scorsese film.</em></p>



<p><em>You wanna see what he has to say next.&nbsp;And in games, we don’t consider&nbsp;the individual voices of creators often&nbsp;to be worthy of that value and prioritization.&nbsp;We say, oh, it’s a new Kratos game,&nbsp;but we try to, in the process,&nbsp;even if we aren’t trying to,&nbsp;we somewhat say, it’s a new Kratos game,&nbsp;not the next game from this person&nbsp;and their creative perspective&nbsp;that you’ve already fallen in love with before.</em></p>



<p><em>So again, at Strange Scaffold,&nbsp;something we did very intentionally,&nbsp;our game design was,&nbsp;we’re going to give you more experiences.&nbsp;We’re gonna give you something that you care about.&nbsp;We’re going to, and we’re gonna do it quickly enough&nbsp;that even if you don’t like one individual game,&nbsp;the next game is around the corner.</em></p>



<p><em>So the Strange Scaffold collection now on Steam&nbsp;of like seven to eight video games&nbsp;that all have that perspective,&nbsp;every Steam sale, even outside of Steam sales,&nbsp;people find one game like Clickolding,&nbsp;which is three bucks,&nbsp;and they buy the $100 collection.&nbsp;And that’s in capitalism terms,&nbsp;that’s what keeps the studio afloat.&nbsp;And we built it that way.</em></p>



<p><em>And you can, and most people do,&nbsp;build your studio around blockbusters.&nbsp;Three years from now, five years from now,&nbsp;we’re gonna have the biggest game of all time.&nbsp;I don’t wanna do that, so I don’t.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-why-put-out-so-many-games-in-such-a-short-order">Why put out so many games in such a short order?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr:</strong> &nbsp;<em>It’s not so much driven by fear.&nbsp;It is more so driven by mortality,&nbsp;if we wanna get down to the core reasonings here.&nbsp;I am going to die one day.</em></p>



<p><em>And if I have a choice between making one perfect game,&nbsp;even though we know perfection does not exist,&nbsp;in this world at least,&nbsp;if I have the choice between spending 10 years&nbsp;making my magnum opus,&nbsp;or 10 years making 30 buck wild things&nbsp;that would never exist otherwise,&nbsp;I’d rather say that I’d rather do the second one.&nbsp;And there’s some people who would only rather do the first.&nbsp;And one of the things I tell people&nbsp;when they’re trying to start a studio,&nbsp;or when we’re talking about building a new project&nbsp;is know yourself.</em></p>



<p><em>I know because among other things,&nbsp;I worked on Hypnospace Outlaw.&nbsp;That was like a five, six year game.&nbsp;I was only on there for two and a half, three years of it,&nbsp;but it was still a rough time.</em></p>



<p><em>And we come sprinting to the finish line&nbsp;and we’re wiped out and exhausted.&nbsp;And we are at the total mercy of this one day&nbsp;will determine whether we get to keep making video games.&nbsp;How do the rest of our lives go?&nbsp;Right?&nbsp;And I was like, I don’t want to do that again.</em></p>



<p><em>It was so great to see the response to Hypnospace Outlaw&nbsp;that people did find value in what we had done.&nbsp;But one other flip of the coin&nbsp;and Hypnospace Outlaw is one of dozens,&nbsp;hundreds of stunning indie and double A and triple A games&nbsp;that just falls through the murk.&nbsp;So I don’t want to be at risk.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to provide for my family&nbsp;and I want to say more in the limited time&nbsp;that I have on this earth.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-favorite-feature-in-i-am-your-beast">Favorite feature in I Am Your Beast?</h3>



<p><strong>Nelson Jr:</strong><em> I really think the feature that I’m most excited about,&nbsp;I’m, the thing I geek out about&nbsp;when I play other games as well,&nbsp;and this even goes back to before I was a game developer,&nbsp;was when artistic quality and efficiency meet in the middle&nbsp;and two things work together to provide something&nbsp;that never could have resulted without either one.&nbsp;I love those kinetic text cut scenes so much&nbsp;because they’re the exact type of thing&nbsp;that this industry, as it currently exists,&nbsp;would say is not enough.</em></p>



<p><em>This doesn’t tell the story.&nbsp;This doesn’t tell the story well for players.&nbsp;This isn’t stylish.</em></p>



<p><em>This isn’t, whatever is the intention behind it,&nbsp;this is not up to par is the thing I have heard&nbsp;and the thing that I have seen this industry say&nbsp;to all sorts of similar solutions over time.&nbsp;And having the audience so joyously react to that,&nbsp;hearing from other game developers&nbsp;that when our, even before the Next Fest demo was playable,&nbsp;even though it was playable that day,&nbsp;but when the demo came out and when the trailer came out,&nbsp;I have been told by multiple developers now&nbsp;that they’ve taken this back to their publishers&nbsp;and said, hey, we want to,&nbsp;this is something people are really excited about.&nbsp;We want to use it to do our own take on this&nbsp;and that they’re getting approval to do more efficient&nbsp;takes on storytelling that work for their games.</em></p>



<p><em>That’s what brings my heart eternal joy.&nbsp; Not only do we get to make a really cool,&nbsp;very stylish thing, we were right,&nbsp;I’ll say I was right about that one,&nbsp;but that solution gives other developers the freedom to say,&nbsp;what actually makes the player’s experience better?&nbsp;In Ace Combat 7, it’s a JPEG of a dog.</em></p>



<p><em>We don’t have the time, budget,&nbsp;we can put that into more cool ass planes flying at Mach 10.&nbsp;So we put it, so we can just have a JPEG of a dog&nbsp;and it makes people happy.&nbsp;It looks wild as hell.</em></p>



<p><em>Giving other people the internal permission even to say,&nbsp;what makes the player’s experience better?&nbsp;That’s what makes my day&nbsp;and that’s what makes me excited about I Am At Peace&nbsp;because it’s filled with that.&nbsp;And I can’t wait for people to play it&nbsp;and to either have their day get made&nbsp;or to find a path for their own creativity&nbsp;in the things that we chose.</em></p>

			<p>As proudly individual as each game in the SteamWorld series is, sometimes you just want a good old fashioned sequel, a game that goes back over familiar ground and tries to make things bigger and better. With close to a decade since the original, it feels like high time that Thunderful return to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/21/steamworld-heist-review/">one of their most popular entries</a> with the side-scrolling turn-based action of SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh7iOX-TCjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Where the first Heist was a space-faring jaunt in junky steampunk ships, SteamWorld Heist 2 throws you right into the midsts of a great ecological crisis threatening its watery world where boats and subs are the order of the day. Oh sure, it’s already just a fragment of a planet hurtling through space, but where now Steambots are struggling to find clean water, afflicting them with Rust, and there’s literally just one ship’s captain who’s got a hope of unpicking the mystery of what’s going on. Captain Leeway steps into the breach – no, not “Krakenbane” herself, but her son – or at least, he would do, but at the start of the game, he’s very much down on his luck, his inherited submarine having been confiscated and having lost his good arm for shooting.</p>


<p>So the game opens with an introductory mission with his last two trusty crew members embarking on an audacious mission to steal his submarine back, facing off against the Dieselbots of the Royal Navy to do so. This personal task successfully completed, and Captain Leeway is thrust into continuing his campaign against the Dieselbots, the mysteriously bony Rattlers, and trying to get to the bottom of what’s giving all the Steambots a nasty case of Rust – hint, it’s the salty water.</p>


<p>Just as before, SteamWorld Heist 2 is XCOM given the Flat Stanley treatment. Instead of commanding your handful of crew members through 3D spaces, you’ve got a side-on view of every combat location. It’s a nice and permissive kind of turn-based tactical battling though, letting you aim and shoot through the cover you’re hiding behind and past allies, through thinner gantry-like flooring, and using ricochets to hit enemies who are in cover themselves. And instead of aim being a percentage based roll of the dice, it’s more like Worms in that you have to line up your shot and then time it with the natural sway of the weapon – It helps greatly that one of your first characters is a sniper, which gives you a laser sight that even shows bullet bounces.</p>
<p>SteamWorld Heist 2 comes with a new Jobs system for classes, though, all dependent on which primary weapon is equipped. There’s no limitations to Job switching, and as soon as you’ve gained a level in one role, those skills can then be unlocked for another role by assigning Cogs. The Flanker and Brawler are easy to synergise, giving a melee character much enhanced movement, while you could turn your Sniper into a backline support with cover building and team healing abilities from the Engineer.</p>

<p>The deeper you get into the game, the more weapons and gear that you’ll earn, and there’s further avenues to upgrade your characters and roster as a whole. Higher levelled weapons will dish out more damage, and there’s also Epic weapons with special effects, like a sniper with electric discharge, or a crossbow for the Reaper instead of an SMG.</p>
<p>There’s some great nuances to explore here, especially as you need to make the very most of every advantage your get on higher difficulties, and there’s missions that will hew toward one style of play or another. Compared to the original, level layouts are now fixed, but with randomised cover and enemies, so you have much more repeatable experiences than the more broadly procedural levels of before. That leads to missions where, confronted with countless Rattler totems and a secondary objective not to destroy any of them yourself, you’ll need precision and minimal ricochets –&nbsp;it took me a few tries. And then there’s just stages that are designed for varying team sizes.</p>
<p>Another big area that SteamWorld Heist 2 improves upon is with everything between missions. Yes, there’s downtime at safe havens and bars, where you can rest up to get to the next day, shop for better gear and chat to NPCs –&nbsp;you’ll also get the luxurious vocal harmonies of the original songs by Steam Powered Giraffe stuck in your head – but then there’s the neat open world to sail around to get to each location, and enemy ships to battle.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="A Life of Un-Delightment by Steam Powered Giraffe (Official Music Video) SteamWorld Heist II" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cGwq9r51cc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The submarine is pretty weak to start off, but with weapon mounts to the side, front and top, as well as more unlockable slots for upgrades, it can become a pretty fierce little thing, capable of taking on enemy capital ships. That’s especially true because of how agile it is with responsive arcade handling, not to mention the upgrade to let you dive beneath the surface –&nbsp;where you’ll come to find other subs and mines. It’s a fun diversion between the sometimes gruelling battles.</p>
<p>By default, the game comes at you with the Experienced difficulty level, and through the opening regions, that’s pretty straightforward to handle. However, the Rattlers can really swarm you and levels often have enemy spawn points that make you scramble and rush just to survive –&nbsp;by the third or fourth region the difficulty had really stepped up a few notches. Thankfully the difficulty is customisable beyond the fistful of presets, and a checkpoint system mid-level lets you roll back up to two turns if you want to slap yourself for a dumb move or fluffed shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/armor-games-publishing-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reports are emerging of staff at Armor Games' publishing division being laid off, and some staff are suggesting that the entire publishing department of the company has been let go.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/michelle_lega/status/1818708889627697485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, senior producer Michelle Lega said yesterday that she had been laid off and that the studio's team <a href="https://x.com/michelle_lega/status/1818710369294336177" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would "all be looking for jobs soon"</a>, suggesting that nobody at Armor Games has kept their jobs in this latest layoff wave.</p>
<p>Several <a href="https://x.com/bearskvlls/status/1818722008739586413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> Armor Games <a href="https://x.com/kenzie__du/status/1818943712300609839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">employees</a> have corroborated the reports of layoffs, suggesting that at the very least, the studio has undergone a fairly severe "restructuring", as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures">Humble Games would likely call it</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bear-and-breakfast-armor-games-woods.jpg?itok=T_46VUWk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bear-and-breakfast-armor-games-woods.jpg?itok=x7_hlGsA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Armor Games is responsible for publishing titles like&nbsp;<em>Bear and Breakfast</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, Armor Games itself hasn't issued any kind of official statement regarding the layoffs at its publishing department, although with reports from employees piling up, it might not be long before we hear something from the studio.</p>
<p>It's not exactly clear what's going to happen to Armor Games' published titles, which include the likes of cozy woodland management sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bear-and-breakfast"><em>Bear and Breakfast</em></a>, escape room adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tartarus-key-review"><em>The Tartarus Key</em></a>, and black-and-white RPG&nbsp;<em>In Stars and Time</em>, among others.</p>
<p>Assuming that Armor Games' publishing department has shut down, it wouldn't be the first indie studio to undergo mass layoffs in the last few months. There's the aforementioned Humble Games, of course, which has supposedly completely shut down, and other indie companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs"><em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs"><em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>studio Bossa</a> have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next in the case of Armor Games. We've reached out to Armor for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear anything back.</p>

            <p>Hardened battle royalists will remember Caldera, the sandy island map of bunkers and palm trees in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call Of Duty: Warzone</a>. It got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pour-one-out-for-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-which-is-shutting-down-in-september">shut down last year</a> as Activision focused their efforts elsewhere, making the map unplayable. But you can now revisit those bullet-strewn beaches. In theory, anyway. Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool. But among their reasons for doing so, there lies a predictably grubby logic: they want people to use the data to train AI. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Open-source assets like Caldera play a vital role in the advancement of artificial intelligence," says <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-releases-call-of-duty-warzone-caldera-data-set">a post by Activision</a> accompanying the map files. "By providing a rich, diverse environment, we facilitate the training of AI models, enhancing the industry’s understanding of complex geometries and interactions. This can lead to more intelligent systems, paving the way for the next generation of gaming and simulation technologies." </p>
<p>It is easy to read this and assume it is Activision's way of saying: hey, level designers, your job is also unsafe. The data they're releasing also includes records of the paths players took across the island. That information is often critical to designers of these sorts of huge landmasses. </p>
<p>Whatever the company's motivation, it is certain to elicit mixed emotions in game development circles. Releasing something as open source is often viewed as a virtuous act in software development, since it has benefits that stretch beyond profit margins. But suggesting that your open source offering be used to train machinery that replaces paid human craft and artistry somewhat poisons that virtue. Activision don't seem to be bothered though.</p>
<p>"In an era where AI training and the evolution of authoring tools are pivotal, the availability of production-proven maps is crucial," they say. "This is about collaborating with the gaming and research community to build a foundation for responsible innovation and learning across the industry."</p>
<p>Maybe I'm worrying too much. Yes, we can probably assume Activision would like to further automate processes that involve humans, but it's not certain the data will be as useful to AI researchers as they might hope. For example, their enthusiasm comes at a moment when investors are starting to realise that maybe all those billions of dollars pumped into artificial intelligence <a href="https://futurism.com/investors-concerned-ai-making-money">won't see any profitable result</a>. "Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful," said one Goldman Sach's analyst.</p>
<p>The map data for Caldera is <a href="https://github.com/Activision/caldera">available on Github</a>, and is designed to be opened and viewed with a tool called <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usdview/latest/quickstart.html">USDView</a>. Ignoring the AI-motivated stink, I do think it's cool for normal humans with some technical nouse to be able to fly around maps like this, drinking everything in with nostalgia. I've done the same thing to old Halo 2 maps and get a buzz from peeking around on browser-based toys like <a href="https://noclip.website/">noclip.website</a>, which let you explore maps from Dark Souls, Banjo-Kazooie, and Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Shooty sequel Warzone 2 is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">best battle royale games</a>, so it's likely someone out there will get the same curious joy from flying around Caldera.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Shipping the game won't be a one-and-done process, it'll be evolving in response to player feedback and design shifts throughout the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does the art team intend to handle that challenge? "Flow charts," Moll said. He described a "big" flow chart that maps out the design process—how designers or artists block out a level, iterate, then shift it to the art side, then what to do if the level needs more feedback, etc. etc.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the fun things about working on this kind of game is that there's an indefinite amount of variety that we can add, so we're always brainstorming new ideas and queuing things," he said. "Then when it comes to Early Access, we have our our plans about what we want to make, but we are also preparing to be flexible to player feedback."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He credited lead producer Michael Clark, who has experience on live service games, with building internal processes that could keep content flowing smoothly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another self-imposed limitation that helps this process, DeRiggi added, is that when it comes to the visual design of the Breakers, they're not designed to be visually customizable, a feature found in other live service or roguelike games. "It's a personal world for [Preston]. So he wasn't looking for there to be this whole wide range of customization across the the board of characters," he said.</span></p><p>Image via Heart Machine/Arc Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means he and his colleagues can focus on improving the looks of the revealed characters (mostly through small tweaks, as their designs are pretty much locked-in), and spin up new ones inspired by community feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combine those strategies with some "highly modular" environment kits, and the Hyper Light series is now ready to roll into a new era of game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Heart Machine is a benchmark of how indie developers survive and thrive">Heart Machine is a benchmark of how indie developers survive and thrive</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through hard work and creativity, Preston and his peers have kept one of the most eye-catching indie studios of the 2010s alive even as the game industry struggles through financial crisis and COVID-19.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-bounty-hunters-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tabletop market is full of <em>Star&nbsp;</em><span><em>Wars-</em>themed</span>&nbsp;games, some of them incredible representations of the setting. From roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-deckbuilding-game-review-force-is-strong-with-this-one">card games</a> to the fantastic miniatures games by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/star-wars-shatterpoint-first-impressions">Atomic Mass Games</a>,&nbsp;players can easily recreate epic <em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;battles. It's easy to throw the Star Wars name on a product, but harder to embed the theme in the mechanics and make it feel like a <em>Star Wars</em> game. In this article, we're going to look at the all-new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, a fast-paced card drafting game. Does it feel like a <em>Star Wars</em> game, or is it just a skin over the mechanics?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-3.jpg?itok=PpY-LiBb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-3.jpg?itok=OYlEEb7I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> features some of the most famous bounty hunters across the <em>Star Wars</em> Universe.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does Star Wars Bounty Hunters Play?</h2>
<p>In<i> Star Wars Bounty Hunters,</i> players draw a hand of 5 cards, choose one to play, and then pass the rest to the player on their left, and receive 4 cards from the player on their right, they then draw another card, play a card, and pass again. Play continues this way until 4 contracts are won, and then scores from across a range of areas are totaled up and the winner is declared.</p>
<p>The cards that drive the game are drawn from 4 different decks:</p>
<ul><li>Target - Target cards are the core of <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, they're made up of famous characters from across the <em>Star Wars</em> Universe, and they contain 3 different shield values that must be beaten to collect the bounty, and the points they earn if scored.</li>
<li>Bounty Hunters&nbsp;- Bounty Hunters can be played for free against contracts (and you can also play them without a contract to prepare for one) and they have attack values that are used to defeat the shields on Target cards. Bounty Hunters also contain a negative score, which is deducted&nbsp;from the contract points scored.</li>
<li>Contract - Contract cards contain combinations of Target cards that can earn you bonuses if scored together.</li>
<li>Jawa Market - This deck contains droids, who work similarly to Bounty Hunters (they just need to be paid for rather than being free to play), and Crates, which earn points at the end of the game, and bonus points for the player with the most crates.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-2.jpg?itok=EloEAjB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-2.jpg?itok=JybnECTx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> features 4 types of cards, from left to right Targets, Contracts, Bounty Hunters and Droids (from the Jawa Deck).</figcaption></figure><p>Each turn in <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> happens simultaneously, with players receiving their cards, drawing, and then playing. This format keeps games fast-flowing but can be stalled if players start to analyze every single option. The four decks create a weird dynamic that if you see a card you want in the hand already, you don't want to draw a possibly great card from the Jawa Market or Target Deck, and would rather load the hand with Bounty Hunter cards (which although are free to play, tend to be worse than droids because of the negative points they have) or contract cards (which generally aren't worth the extra effort of trying to score until later in the game). But then if you do fill the hand with duff cards, you will still get that hand back eventually when it passes back to you.</p>
<p>To get around this, we tried a few variations of the rules. Passing the cards face down and drawing before seeing, which is too random as to which deck to draw from, and if you shuffle all the cards into a single deck, it also creates too random an element to be enjoyable. We also tried shuffling the contract and target cards into a single deck, and the bounty hunters and Jawa deck into a single deck, which created an element of randomness, but also meant that you weren't deliberately stuffing the hand you passed to your opponent.</p>
<p>A better way to fix it would have been to make the contract cards more worthwhile, the extra couple of points they give you are rarely worth the effort, and buffing the Bounty Hunters slightly (the stars of the game's title) to balance them better against the droids which even though they cost to play, are usually equal to or better than the Bounty Hunters, but without the negative points modifier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-4.jpg?itok=qmwBqzfh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-bounty-hunters-4.jpg?itok=dSXmZ1mc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the famous faces you will chase down in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's The Theme Like In Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>Other than the art on the cards, and the rough power across the cards (Boba Fett has great stats and Grogu earns you very high points for capturing the target), the theme is a skin across the mechanics. It could be anything and it would still work.</p>
<p>If you're really into <em>Star Wars</em>, then there's something to be said about using famous bounty hunters and droids to chase down the good guys of the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, but if you want some depth to your theme, then <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> is very light.</p>
<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>The theme for <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em> is just a skin over the mechanics, which could be forgiven if it was an incredible drafting game, but the balance between the 4 card types feels off, which then throws off the drafting element of it. This also complicates it for younger players, which the artwork looks like it's aimed at, as not understanding the complexities of the different card types and playing tactically, mean that it can be a frustrating game for younger players.</p>
<p>I can't help thinking that if it was a single deck, with each card having a few options for use, that would have worked better, but in its current state it just felt strange to play. In the test games we played, we usually ended up with hands full of cards you didn't want, and just alternating between burning a card for credits, and hoping to draw a droid the next turn.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Star Wars Bounty Hunters?</h2>
<p>If you really really love <em>Star Wars</em>, then you will be able to get behind <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunters</em>, but for the rest, it's neither a great tactical drafting game, nor a quick fun-filled easy game, and treads a weird line between the 2 types, while not having the great bits of either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/steamworld-heist-ii-review-underwhelming-haul-o-loot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard not to appreciate what <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/thunderful-publishing">Thunderful</a> is doing with their ever-expanding <em>SteamWorld</em> franchise. Spanning across multiple genres are titles that take risks and try something new, all featuring a unique world full of robots running on steam. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, then, is just as charming and polished as the rest, but it didn't click with me as well as it should.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is a game made with people like me in mind -- I'm a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> fiend, but this genre thrives on variation, and that is something <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>doesn't do well. The experience is well-crafted, no doubt, but its gameplay does little to evolve over the course of its 25+ hour adventure.</p>
<p>Players take the role of Captain Leeway, a one-armed Steambot living in the shadow of his much more famous mother. He's trying to carve a legend for himself and solidify his place in this world of steam. Trading the sci-fi aesthetic of the first <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> for a pirate adventure, you'll sail the high seas and fight against other factions of bots along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-guns.jpg?itok=0aYurGTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-guns.jpg?itok=8K9lR-Ph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remember to ricochet.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> -- A Unique Take on Strategy Games</h2>
<p>As they say, variety is the spice of life. Up front, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> certainly appears to have a great deal of customization and depth, even more so than its predecessor. There are several classes with unique abilities, plenty of gear, different crew members, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, the core gameplay is itself still as fun as the original. The side-scrolling nature of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> helps it stand out among other turn-based tactics games. Crew members are, for the most part, armed with guns and the gimmick of making bullets ricochet all around is entertaining. You can pull some seriously cool shots here, but that's also no different than the original game.</p>
<p>At first glance, it does come off as a bit of a palate swap, and I can't lie, I do miss the sci-fi, spaceship theme of the original. Even still, <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> <em>II </em>tries to mix things up by adding a variety of different sea-based environments and forts to capture. But again, try as Thunderful might to innovate, after several hours of gameplay, I felt like I saw everything the game had to offer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-units.jpg?itok=lHVDmV0f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-units.jpg?itok=aLcHg4So 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Six classes isn't a lot, and there aren't all that many abilities that stand out, either.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Certain Lack of Depth in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></h2>
<p>Classes have linear skill trees and you can even combine two or more classes together. Characters level up as they complete missions and advance the skill tree. You can allocate a resource called cogs to activate certain talents on the tree.</p>
<p>You theoretically have the ability to create a very diverse character, but I never felt like I was able to achieve that. XP gain was pretty slow, so at best I combined two classes together. Now, classes are dictated by weapon type, but even with mix-and-matched talents and weapons, characters didn't feel all that different.</p>
<p>For a loose comparison, other tactics games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fire-emblem-engage-review"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a> have dozens of classes, but in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, you're only dealing with a handful. You can only have so much variation and, though I admire the game's attempt to create a flexible class system, it just didn't resonate with me. Perhaps the best way to put it is an overall lack of depth in a game that would benefit from more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-boss.jpg?itok=RB3grrBx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-boss.jpg?itok=qvMz6Xzh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss battles are few and far between in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While you can equip weapons that behave slightly different from one another, it's still not enough. Abilities specific to certain crew members, like this powerful beam called Eldritch Blast on one particular bot, is all well and good, but have longer cooldowns so you're using the same class-based abilities much more often.</p>
<p>There are several factions in the game, each a bit different from the other, but they are used in so many missions it all feels quite samey after a while. Level objectives, too, try to add unique criteria so you can get a better score and earn extra loot, but again, they don't vary all that much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat-2_0.jpg?itok=xrUB8z20 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat-2_0.jpg?itok=uFCEuRlo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Those skeletons are robots, I assure you.</figcaption></figure><h2>RNG and Alarms, Oh Boy</h2>
<p>Most of the time, you're tasked with collecting a set amount of loot before a time limit expires, or eliminate an enemy in a super specific way. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> does get tiring with these time limits, <em>especially</em> with alarms. After a bit, reinforcements are called by these alarms and, like the first game, they do <em>not</em> end.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of enemy is thrown at you during these alarms, and it can get chaotic very fast. Getting overwhelmed is a real possibility, and this exacerbates the feeling of repetition. There's no real nuance to throwing droves of endless enemies at you, especially when they all behave the same.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat.jpg?itok=3pm-1TG7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-combat.jpg?itok=l6sfgeJV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, point-blank is the way to go.</figcaption></figure><p>More to that point, these spawns from alarms are also completely RNG-based. You're able to go back two turns in a given level at any time. This is often used to rectify mistakes you make. What ends up happening is these spawns from alarms are totally different when you go back two turns. You can end up with way less enemies and even less powerful ones, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The problems I had with <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>'s depth are more a matter of taste, but RNG is a real issue here. It's really quite baffling to go from a turn spawning several beefy, powerful enemies, only to use the reload option (that you're encouraged to use, by the way) and end up fighting one puny enemy instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-naval-combat.jpg?itok=WCv2VeXV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-naval-combat.jpg?itok=b2QI85He 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David versus Goliath.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Choice of Controls</h2>
<p>Other than that, the other glaring issue here is using mouse and keyboard versus controller. <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>'s weird keybinding for actions and abilities on mouse and keyboard are rectified when using a controller. But, as you have to manually aim characters' guns, it is much more efficient and precise to use mouse.</p>
<p>As a result, I ended up incorporating this hybrid type of play, using my controller for most abilities except when I needed to aim. Missing a shot can be a big deal, so it behooves you to be as precise as possible to land those headshots and ricochet bullets.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-submarine.jpg?itok=6bR2wLOM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-submarine.jpg?itok=-C82TXwY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what's in the depths of this sea?</figcaption></figure><p>I touched on this in my preview from Summer Game Fest, but there's also an overworld component through which you control and navigate your own ship. It's secondary to actual tactical combat with your bots, but it adds a bit more variety to break up the monotony. You can position your ship and it shoots weapons automatically, so it's not the most "active" form of gameplay.</p>
<p>It's decently fun to use the ship and later on, it becomes a submarine, though it hardly changes the gameplay much. It's the means by which you travel mission to mission, but by the end of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, I would have much preferred fast travel or something to make it less of a bother to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-dialogue-2.jpg?itok=DCNgsHqA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-dialogue-2.jpg?itok=DUyAKJH7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's alright, this robbery is for the people.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>My thoughts on the story are brief because I couldn't get hooked by the narrative. I didn't care for any of the characters or their motivations, which is a shame. It's not that it isn't well-written -- it is perfectly fine as is -- but it's not particularly interesting, either. There's humor here and there, but it didn't click. Though, if you are a fan of <em>SteamWorld</em> lore, I'm sure it'll tickle you fancy.</p>
<p>It actually hurts to be critical towards<em> SteamWorld Heist II,</em> as this is a clear labor of love. And it's not a bad game either -- not by a long shot -- it just has noticeable flaws that hindered it from being great. Though it feels far too long for its own good and lacks much nuance in its gameplay, <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>might just tickle your fancy.</p>

Despite SteamWorld Heist II's shortcomings, it's a fun and polished game. It does, however, suffer from repetition and lack of depth, so it feels like you've seen all it has to offer after a few hours. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The Korean show proved so big it became Netflix’s most popular series ever, knocking <em>Bridgerton</em> into a fancy, feathered hat, despite being subtitled and starring no internationally-known actors. So yes, clearly the streaming service <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflixs-squid-game-looking-far-more-likely-to-get-a-se-1847792709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflixs-squid-game-looking-far-more-likely-to-get-a-se-1847792709">would like some more of that</a></span>, thank you very much, as would the program’s creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk.</p><p>The nine episodes followed a group of 456 people taking part in a deadly series of playground games for the amusement of super-wealthy onlookers, while simultaneously telling us the backstory of central character, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae, who has since gone on to English-language fame via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-oshamir-ship-reylo-episode-8-1851600313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-oshamir-ship-reylo-episode-8-1851600313"><em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em></a></span>). While its ending was by no means absolute, it arguably came to a very (un)satisfying conclusion (GET ON THE PLANE, MAN!), and perfectly wrapped up its parable of the destructive evils of capitalism. Which leaves that agonizing paradox of wanting more, but really not being sure you’re right to.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflixs-squid-game-is-a-is-a-furious-prophetic-show-th-1847781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflixs-squid-game-is-a-is-a-furious-prophetic-show-th-1847781001">Netflix’s Squid Game Is A Furious Prophetic Show That’s Taking The World By Storm</a></span></p><p>In the three years since, Netflix has created an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/squid-game-netflix-reality-show-legal-action-unsafe-1850070999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/squid-game-netflix-reality-show-legal-action-unsafe-1850070999">irony-free</a></span> real-life version of the game show element, <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em>, while MrBeast ensured his position as the biggest YouTuber in the world with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his own unofficial version</a></span>.

By June 2022, the greenlight for the second season was confirmed. And we now know it’ll air December 26, 2024.</p><p>The next run is likely to focus more on the mysterious Front Man and his police officer brother, while digging into the background of the so-called “salesman character.” In 2022 we also learned that Lee Jung-jae would reprise his lead role, alongside Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo and Wi Ha-joon, with the addition of superstar Park Sung-hoon (<em>The Glory</em>, <em>Queen of Tears</em>) among others. Skip forward two rather quiet years, and now we finally have a teaser trailer!</p><p>The teaser shows contestants running down a competition-size running track, while observed by familiar <em>Squid Game</em> guards, as players fall to the ground (and knowing this show, are probably dead). Then, right at the end, it reveals there will be a third and final season in 2025.</p><p>I’m guessing, but I’d assume these would have to be being made back-to-back, given the <em>enormous</em> lead time on premium shows like these for streaming networks. With a two-year gap now becoming pretty normal between seasons of the most popular shows (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/feature/the-boys-season-5-everything-we-know-1236014576/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/feature/the-boys-season-5-everything-we-know-1236014576/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Boys</em> being the most recent to announce this</a></span>), it seems a safe bet that the expanded writers’ room (Hwang wrote all nine episodes of the first season alone, but said his lack of planning for the story to continue would require a team to achieve more) would have written both seasons in one go. It’d also seem odd to strike sets between filming seasons, given the timeframe.</p><p>So, we only need to wait for Christmas to enjoy another round of gruesome capitalistic horror. And then the next day, season two of <em>Squid Game </em>will stream.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40047/until-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB site</a>, the anticipated new version of Until Dawn coming PC and PlayStation 5 now has a rating and corresponding summary.</p>



<p>Naturally, the survival horror classic Until Dawn earned another M rating, since its gameplay always featured “depictions of intense violence and/or gore.” </p>



<p>The ESRB rating reinforces that Until Dawn’s new release is still on track. It may even arrive sooner than expected, though that’s only speculation.</p>



<p>PlayStation most recently teased the rebuilt version from Ballistic Moon during its latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> in May 2024. The current release window for the game is Fall 2024, but it still doesn’t have a concrete release date.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Developer Supermassive Games released the original Until Dawn in 2015. The cinematic, narrative-driven horror game emphasizes player decisions. It also featured some Hollywood actors, such as Hayden Panettiere and Rami Malek.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, the rebuilt version of Until Dawn coming to PC will include Unreal Engine visuals and new content. </p>



<p>That includes “collectibles, all-new environments to investigate, and re-cut narrative sequences.” There will also be a third-person camera and other quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>In January 2024, PlayStation Productions and Screen Gems also confirmed that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn movie adaptation</a> is also in the works. David F. Sandberg, known for Annabelle: Creation and the DCEU’s Shazam films, is attached to direct.</p>

                <p>August has arrived, and this month, Prime Gaming members can grab an impressive number of PC games. As part of the Prime subscription service, these games will be made available in several weekly waves, and subscribers can look forward to some Steampunk robot adventures, archeological adventures with Lara Croft, and more. Once you claim the free games from Prime Gaming, they are yours to keep forever--even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and score some great freebies.</p><p>Available now, you can add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/steamworld-heist-review/1900-6416338/" data-ref-id="1900-6416338">SteamWorld Heist</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review/1900-6416497/" data-ref-id="1900-6416497">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>, and a few Tomb Raider games to your collection. SteamWorld Heist has a sequel out this month, so if you're looking to experience the original capers of a steam-driven pirate crew as they engage in tactical shootouts, then this game has you covered. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided isn't as good as 2010's Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but it's still a solid stealth-action game where you uncover a global conspiracy and make strange alliances. Since this is a GOG version of the game, you're getting it DRM-free version and with an extra in-game mission to enjoy.</p><p>The week closes out with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-the-last-revelation/" data-ref-id="5000-280">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider-chronicles/" data-ref-id="5000-2857">Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness/" data-ref-id="5000-3292">The Angel of Darkness</a>--old-school Lara Croft games that were released in the early- and mid-2000s. These were the final mainline games developed by Core Design, as publisher Eidos Interactive handed the franchise over to Crystal Dynamics following the poor critical reception of The Angel of Darkness.</p><p>Starting August 8, there are some more great games to grab. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/loop-hero-review/1900-6417656/" data-ref-id="1900-6417656">Loop Hero</a> is a complicated but engaging deckbuilding game and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/trek-to-yomi-review-one-samurai/1900-6417874/" data-ref-id="1900-6417874">Trek to Yomi</a> is a fascinating samurai tale.
