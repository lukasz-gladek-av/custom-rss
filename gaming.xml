            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334067/samsung-odyssey-g8-g6-3d-smart-monitor-m9-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/29/24331748/lg-ultragear-gx9-bendable-oled-5k2k-monitors-specs">LG announced</a> its CES 2025 lineup of monitors, Samsung is doing the same. The company just introduced several new models, and perhaps the most impressive among them is the Odyssey OLED G81SF. It’s a 27-inch 4K monitor with a maximum refresh rate of 240Hz, 0.03ms response time, a glare-free display, and rear-core lighting with 52 color options. Samsung is also including a number of burn-in protection measures to ensure that the Odyssey G81SF’s screen looks pristine for years to come. The G8 is likely to be using the latest and greatest OLED panel from Samsung Display.</p><p>Next up is the Odyssey OLED G60SF — also a 27-inch OLED monitor — with a QHD resolution and an impressive 500Hz refresh rate that Samsung says effectively “eliminates lag and motion blur for ultra-smooth gameplay during critical moments.”</p><p>In 2025, Samsung is also finally shipping the Odyssey 3D monitor it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031774/play-vr-games-without-a-vr-headset">first teased at least year’s CES</a>. It lets you experience 3D visuals <em>without</em> any special glasses by using a lenticular lens on the front panel. “Eye tracking monitors the movement of both eyes using a built-in stereo camera, while view mapping continuously adjusts the image to enhance depth perception,” Samsung said in its press release. The Odyssey 3D only comes in a 27-inch 4K size; the larger 37-inch display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement">mentioned last year</a> has apparently been scrapped. The company says it offers “a rapid 1ms gray-to-gray response time, and a 165Hz refresh rate.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Smart Monitor series is making the switch to OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>That does it for the gaming-focused monitors, but Samsung is also announcing two others that are more focused on everyday productivity. The SmartMonitor series is finally going OLED with the new Smart Monitor M9. And this year, Samsung is throwing in a ton of AI capabilities including AI Picture Optimizer. Like on its TVs, this feature “analyzes input signals to determine the type of content being viewed — such as gaming, video, or productivity applications — and automatically adjust the display settings for the best visual experience.” This also works for gaming and can detect the genre of what you’re playing.</p><p>AI Upscaling Pro can make lower-res content look crisper at the M9’s 4K resolution, and the monitor has a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz. That’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23180741/samsung-m8-smart-monitor-review-32-inch-4k-smart-tv-usb-c-hdr">significant upgrade from the M8</a>, which topped out at 60Hz. Samsung says moving to OLED also allows for a new “ultra-slim” design for the Smart Monitor M9 that should take up considerably less desk space.</p><p>The last monitor being announced (at least for today) is the only non-OLED model of the bunch. The new 37-inch ViewFinity S8 has a 16:9 aspect ratio, a built-in KVM switch, 90W USB-C passthrough charging, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color gamut. Peak brightness for this 4K display tops out at 350 nits, which should be perfectly suitable for anything you’ll be doing at a desk.</p><p>Pricing and release dates are still to come, but <em>The Verge</em> will be in Las Vegas for CES 2025 in a matter of days. So you won’t have to wait much longer for some first-hand impressions of Samsung’s new monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each of <em>Oblivion</em>’s nine regions of Cyrodiil has unique flora and fauna for the team to recreate, and that’s on top of the enormous landscapes and cities.</p><p>The Gold Coast, for instance, is all but complete, with a new version of main city Anvil, “re-envisioned to realize its original concept art.” It’s the most wildly ambitious project, and as you’ll see in the video below, it looks <em>wonderful</em>.</p><p>Given <em>Skyrim</em> itself is 13 years old, it’s a testament to its engine how stunning <em>Skyblivion</em> is looking (albeit boosted by Bethesda’s own <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em> upgrades). It does seem a bit galling that Bethesda will be sitting on whatever tech they’re using for <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, but this still looks so, so much better than the 19-year-old <em>Oblivion</em> original.</p><p>The video’s narration makes clear that in order to release <em>Skyblivion</em>, they are legally required to remake every asset, including all the 3D models, which is a task of unimaginable magnitude. (Bethesda had a team of hundreds working for four years at full pay to do this the first time—this is a group of unpaid volunteers working in their spare time.) As such, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the team is looking for more volunteers</a></span>—especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navmeshing</a></span>, UI and 3D modeling—to help them get the game over the line.</p><figure id="" data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->TES Renewal Project / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-recommend-id="image://8550ca352cd14e6cc4e20537a23563d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a sunny, autumnal glen, with Worldspaces progress bars on the left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This whole thing blows my mind. The Skyblivion Team has also written new music for each section of the game, and they’re even considering porting across the DLC when this main game is finished. Planned since 2011, prototyped by 2014, and in full development from 2018, they’re confident for a 2025 release, likely years ahead of Bethesda’s own follow-up, <em>The Elder Scrolls VI: Hammerfell</em>.</p><p>Kudos to Bethesda for letting extraordinary projects like these thrive, rather than sending takedown notifications and legal threats. To be able to play <em>Skyblivion</em>, you will be required to own legitimate versions of both <em>Oblivion GOTY Deluxe </em>and <em>Skyrim: Special Edition</em>, although given you can currently pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the former for $5</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latter for $10</a></span> on Steam, that’s not a big outlay.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Exactly why has been a matter of some speculation, with the Xbox makers previously suggesting it’s nothing to do with its tech. However, now Game Science CEO Feng Ji has posted to Chinese social media platform Weibo to say it’s absolutely because of that, and specifically the lack of it in the Xbox Series S.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>God bless the Series S—a console so cheap that a few friends and I clubbed together to get it as a wedding present for a chum—but as we enter the second half of this console generation’s lifespan, it’s definitely becoming a problem for developers. Microsoft requires that games released for the more powerful Series X must also work, including all features, on the sub-$300 Series S, and that’s definitely proving trickier as the PC-led fidelity race progresses.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> developer Game Science <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-the-game-awards-winner-1851721695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-the-game-awards-winner-1851721695">hasn’t been shy about making its views clear on various matters</a></span>, and CEO Feng Ji <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223#comment&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223#comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has once more taken to Weibo</a></span> to explain the game’s continuing absence on Xbox.

Perhaps a more experienced team could achieve it, but it’s seemingly beyond what Game Science is able to deliver right now. And given the enormous complexity and GFX-pushing nature of <em>Wukong</em>, Game Science has delivered an <em>extraordinary</em> amount. (It’s worth noting that Microsoft mad an exception to their rule for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-s-split-screen-co-op-rpg-1850770513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-s-split-screen-co-op-rpg-1850770513">where Larian could never get the Series S to handle co-op</a></span>.)</p><p>But the remarks raise concerns about Microsoft’s previous statements on the matter.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> was one of 2024's biggest games, and while support remains ongoing, many are wondering what developer Arrowhead Studios might make next. We still don't know, but COO Johan Pilestedt has now confirmed he has an idea for what the team may make next.</p><p>Posting on social media, Pilestedt said, "What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept..."</p><p>The executive then invited people to share their "speculation" as to what Arrowhead could build next. One person said they'd like to see Arrowhead make a Star Fox-style game where players zip around on aircraft during on-rails missions before a level becomes open-world during a boss fight. Pilestedt said this matches up with the concept for a game Arrowhead wanted to make, "Eagles of Democracy." He even shared some images of this title--check them out below.</p><p>Someone else said they want to see Arrowhead develop a remake of the 1990 retro twin-stick shooter Smash TV. Pilestedt said his team actually created a high concept for this, saying it was aiming to be a top-down re-imagining of the classic arcade game.</p><p>The executive didn't elaborate as to why these two concepts never materialized. However, it's not uncommon in the creative process for ideas to be conceived and then never amount to anything.</p><p>While fans wait to see what Arrowhead might make next, there is still lots more planned for Helldivers 2 as part of its live-service programming. Its latest DLC, a crossover with Killzone, launched in December and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-says-blame-us-not-sony-for-killzone-dlc-pricing/1100-6528564/" data-ref-id="1100-6528564">didn't go over perfectly with fans due its pricing and other issues.</a> Arrowhead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-says-blame-us-not-sony-for-killzone-dlc-pricing/1100-6528564/" data-ref-id="1100-6528564">made changes and apologized to fans</a> over this.</p><p>As of November 2024, Helldivers 2 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024, trailing only Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and College Football 25.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-1-remake-will-launch-in-2025-developer-says.1072677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alkimia Interactive has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>release window, although it's perhaps not quite as specific as you might like if you've been waiting for the game since its announcement.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Alkimia wishes the game's fans and followers a happy new year, promising that 2025 will be "a truly key year" for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>and that it is "working tirelessly" to release the game.</p>

<p>A user named Mr Patrick <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353492" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">commented on that post</a>,&nbsp;saying that Alkimia "won't even inform [us] about [the] release date" after telling players they would "get the game in 2024". Alkimia refutes this claim in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a reply</a>, then says that&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>"will be released in 2025".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=jrcgEJmI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=XcHcjE1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>finally has a (very broad) release window.</figcaption></figure><p>While a promise that the game will launch in 2025 doesn't sound like much, this is technically the first time Alkimia and publisher THQ Nordic have committed to any kind of release window for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed, a collector's edition for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">was revealed in April</a>, allowing players to spend huge amounts of money on a game that still didn't have a release date or window nailed down.</p>

<p>It's nice to know that the two studios haven't given up on&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>. Presumably, we'll be getting a more concrete release date sometime in the next few months, but we'll have to wait and see on that front.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>, it is, as you may have guessed, a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, although "reimagining" might be a little closer to the truth.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>'s setting and basic plot setup remain intact, but the remake will add a number of more modern quality-of-life features, as well as a visual overhaul and other changes. Alkimia describes the project as "faithful".</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005976" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Esports remains a relatively divisive topic going into 2025. Many still see the esports industry as a fledgeling thing doomed to fail, while others believe it’s a titanic powerhouse of potential with untapped avenues of income left, right, and centre.</p>



<p>In recent years, esports has been nothing short of a turbulent space to exist in. It’s still developing – and likely will be for many years to come – and a lot is happening under the hood that the average fan might not see or understand.</p>



<p>In a recent piece covered by Esports Insider, several high-profile stakeholders and leaders in the esports industry were interviewed about their predictions for esports in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mature-and-evolve">‘Mature and Evolve’</h2>



<p>Some of the best answers in Esports Insider’s look-forward piece came from Steve Arhancet, the CEO of Team Liquid, one of the oldest and most successful esports organisations in the world.</p>



<p>When asked about his expectations for 2025, Arhancet said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that in 2025, esports will solidify itself as a cultural force rather than a fleeting trend. The past few years have forced companies to mature and evolve, and the separation between companies that have built real businesses and those who chase empty metrics will grow even more significant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this, we will see more consolidation, mergers and acquisitions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve seen plenty of high-profile mergers and acquisitions in the last few years. For instance, in the Call of Duty League, several teams performed mergers to either stay afloat or bolster their resources, with the likes of Cloud9, Gentle Mates, and Team Falcons working their way into the Call of Duty pro scene in earnest.</p>



<p>Arhancet went on to dip into Tema Liquid’s success in 2024, commenting on what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Team Liquid achieved its 2024 goal of being EBITDA positive.</p>



<p>(In 2025, Team Liquid wants to) be a leader in competitive gaming and build a global and multigenerational sports team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of ongoing success and sustainability, Arhancet suggested what needs to be done for more organisations to become profitable and hit their EBITDA boosts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Monetisation models remain the Achilles’ heel of esports.&nbsp; We need to find that next gear beyond just ad spend and sponsorships, and create direct fan monetisation systems that feel natural, rewarding and equitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would go hand-in-hand with improved economics between developers and/or tournament organisers and teams.</p>
</blockquote>

                <p>According to a research company, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> could bring in more than $3 billion in total revenues during the first 12 months after launch. A report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> cites data from DFC Intelligence that says GTA 6 could bring in $3.2 billion in its first year and that the game is likely to surpass $1 billion in preorder revenue alone.</p><p>The report didn't mention how DFC might have arrived at these estimates or if they also included revenue from microtransactions and sales of any potential GTA VI premium editions. GameSpot has contacted DFC in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>GTA 6 earning a mountain of money would be one of the least-surprising pieces of news in video game history. After all, it's the sequel to one of the world's most popular video games, and hype for the open-world title is already massive and continues to grow.</p><p>For comparison, GTA 5 earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-v-sales-reach-1-billion-in-three-days/1100-6414762/" data-ref-id="1100-6414762">$1 billion in revenue after just 72 hours on sale back in September 2013</a>. This did not include any GTA Online revenue, either, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-vs-online-mode-wont-be-available-at-launch/1100-6413025/" data-ref-id="1100-6413025">GTA Online did not release until October 2013</a>.</p><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick told FT that he would "never claim victory before it occurs." However, Zelnick said he feels confident that Rockstar Games will release "something absolutely phenomenal."</p><p>GTA 6 has been in development for many years already, though it wasn't until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-development-is-well-underway-rockstar-confirms/1100-6500325/" data-ref-id="1100-6500325">February 2022 that Rockstar Games officially acknowledged the game's existence.</a> The FT report cited estimates for the game's development costs (it didn't mention marketing costs) as being between the "high hundreds of millions" to more than $2 billion, including costs for the game's expected post-launch updates.</p><p>GTA 6 has enormous shoes to fill, as GTA 5 has sold more than 205 million copies, making it the No. 3 best-selling game ever, only behind Minecraft and Tetris.</p><p>GTA 6 is officially set for launch in Fall 2025, a window that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Take-Two has committed to on multiple occasions.</a> Some believe the game may slip to 2026, in part because every Rockstar game from the past decade has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">delayed beyond its original publicly announced date</a>. Others believe the game might have already been delayed internally, based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reports that GTA 6 has missed multiple internal deadlines</a>.</p><p>What we do know is that Rockstar went an entire year without uttering a peep about GTA 6.

Many expected Rockstar to release the next trailer at some point in 2024, but that did not happen, despite the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">so-called evidence that fans believe they discovered.</a> Zelnick recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">he understands fans are growing impatient</a>, but Rockstar refuses to release the game until it's ready.</p>

            <p>Brendan Greene, the modder-turned-millionaire who designed battle royale game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>, wants to make his studio's next game a "metaverse", although he says he's wary of using the term. The project is called "Artemis" (at least for now) and you won't be seeing it any time soon. That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. </p>
<p>Greene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led "multiverse of worlds" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>. He is nonetheless "full of confidence".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Yes], it's a big vision," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-creator-of-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse">IGN in a recent interview</a>, "but I've got a good team of industry professionals and they don't think it's that crazy.</p>
<p>"I hesitate to talk about this, because it's just such a dirty word, but I want to build a metaverse because I don't think anyone else is. I think everyone's building IP bubbles that might talk to each other at some stage in the future, maybe if we're lucky, but it's not the metaverse. See, the Metaverse is a 3D internet. You should be able to create your own worlds and just have them all operating on the same protocol, like HTTP. So a world is a page, and that's what I'm trying to do with Artemis.”</p><p>What Artemis will actually look like, and what players (users?) will actually do within that realm isn't talked about in concrete terms, except to say it might be a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>'s Holodeck or Minecraft's survival mode. He also says his studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, may build it with the world-generation technology they're creating for their upcoming survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, which so far seems an aesthetically realistic orienteer 'em up with hunger, thirst, and all the usual survival game go-tos. Artemis itself, however, is years away from release, according to Greene. And even when it does come out, it's possible it'll take time to gain traction. </p>
<p>“The internet was empty when it first started, and it was just the way of sharing data, and I look at this the same. This is probably going to be empty for the first few years, but then eventually you'll start to see the possibility of what you can do with this kind of world generator that it's like a multiverse of worlds.”</p>
<p>Greene expands on his thoughts in the interview but the gist is this: Artemis is still a lot of big, cloudy ideas. My gut reaction to millionaires chasing the metaverse is rabid, frothing-at-the-mouth skepticism. The two mentioned inspirations (the Holodeck and Minecraft) have something of a chasm between them in technical terms. And the player-led creativity Greene describes already exists in other games such as Roblox, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-is-limiting-access-to-social-hangouts-and-unrated-games-for-children-aged-under-13">struggles just to keep its audience of children protected from harm</a>. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Fortnite has given players tools to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-creative-20s-beta-is-out-allowing-for-some-wild-custom-content">make their own creations with the Unreal Editor For Fortnite</a> and other studios are building similar games-as-a-platform, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a>, an upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everywhere-from-a-former-gta-producer-looks-like-a-retro-throwback-to-2022s-metaverse-craze">make-your-own-minigame machine</a> by Build A Rocket Boy, itself described in somewhat grandiose terms for what looks to be essentially Dreams for the PlayStation with more multiplayer options. It might be exactly these types of games that Greene thinks of as "IP bubbles", but it's not clear what will make PlayerUnknown's Metagrounds different from these.</p><p>Artemis is also - let's face it - unlikely to be as revolutionary as the internet, the thing Greene repeatedly compares it to. I'm wary of calling the metaverse the holy grail of the tech world, mainly because many head honchos in games and technology seem to hear the words "holy grail" and think: "cool thing we can definitely achieve if we pump enough money into it!" Which is not quite the original meaning of the phrase. But also calling the metaverse a "holy grail" implies it is a universally desirable thing in the first place. And I'm not sure that's true. Many people just want to play a video game.</p>
<p>Greene does talk more about all the possibilities for Artemis in the interview, so it's worth reading if you want to understand his reasoning and get a sense for some of the other questions that arise from his ponderings. When asked how such a world-of-worlds would be moderated, he says: "we're going to have to figure it out" and acknowledges it is "important to get right".  When asked if Artemis will use NFTs, he says it won't, despite <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artemis-pubg-creators-next-game-will-have-nfts-and-the-metaverse">a previous report</a> claiming this would be the case. </p>
<p>For now, Artemis remains a non-extant dream of unproven value. Whatever it turns out to be might be fun. It might even get the hundreds of thousands of players of Plunkbat. But will it get the millions Greene is fantasising about? Will it be a second 3D internet? I'm not so sure. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-could-make-1-billion-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been estimated by a gaming research group that Grand Theft Auto 6, the world’s most anticipated game, could secure $1 billion in pre-orders before it hits the market later this year. This monumental figure was expanded by the agency suggesting that GTA 6 could go on to make more than $3 billion in under a year.</p>



<p>It has been predicted that GTA 6 will make around $3.2 billion in 12 months once it launches this year – expectations are currently sitting at an October release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a report published in the Financial Times, the stability of the games industry was explored. It all began with a deep dive into how much GTA 6 is expected to make when it’s finally released later this year. Per an estimation from DFC Intelligence, GTA 6 could make $1 billion in pre-orders alone. </p>



<p>Ultimately, it has been predicted that GTA 6 will go on to decimate the numbers secured by GTA 5 in 2013.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Financial Times</a>, Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two (Rockstar Games’ parent company) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal. Certainly the anticipation is high.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zelnick also contributed to the discussion about the health of the current gaming generation and consumer spending habits:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s way too early to believe that this [console] generation is maturing or has reached its apex.</p>



<p>You’re seeing more consumer demand broadly. And the industry, frankly led by us, has an amazing release schedule coming in 2025 and beyond. A hit coming from one company tends to benefit the entire industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 has already broken viewership records on YouTube. From the moment the first trailer was released in December 2023, fans turned feral, scouring every frame for secrets and hints. Today, it’s still one of the most talked-about videos in the world, and that’s aided by the fact that a high-res version of the trailer recently surfaced online.</p>



<p>How do you think GTA 6 will perform in the pre-order stakes? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Surprising no-one, GTA 6 is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of 2025, ahead of any movie or competing video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DFC predicted total revenue from GTA 6’s first 12 months on sale will reach $3.2 billion. To put that into context, 2024’s highest-grossing movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/inside-out-2">Inside Out 2</a>, made just shy of $1.7 billion at the global box office. In 2013, it took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> just three days to surpass $1 billion in sales — the fastest to that figure in entertainment history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, told the Financial Times: “I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal… Certainly the anticipation is high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge projected revenue of GTA 6 is up against similarly huge development costs, which the Financial Times estimates from the high hundreds of millions to as much as $2 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two">There’s a lot riding on GTA 6, then, but not just for Take-Two and Rockstar</a>. In March last year, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Rockstar’s surefire hit would spark “renewed interest” in video games, before going one step further: “There's probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry, so no pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is the kind of game that will sell consoles. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-likely-out-later-in-2024-analysts-say"><u>Sony’s PS5 Pro</u></a> will no doubt benefit greatly from interest in GTA 6, too. Let’s remember: GTA 6 is not coming out on PC at launch; to play you <em>must </em>own a PlayStation or an Xbox. Beyond the point of sale, GTA 6’s GTA Online equivalent will surely come packed with microtransactions as the current GTA Online does. Microsoft and Sony will get their cut of any money spent there, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Financial Times points out, the almost guaranteed success of GTA 6 comes amid one of the toughest periods for the video game industry in recent memory. More than 33,000 people have lost their jobs since 2022, with huge layoffs at the likes of Microsoft and Sony. Indeed, Take-Two itself has suffered layoffs and studio closures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Rockstar for a firm GTA 6 release date, or, as some are predicting, a delay into 2026. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-delayed-due-to-series-s-memory-limitations-producer-says.1072623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>producer Feng Ji has stated that the reason the game's Xbox port has been such a long time coming has to do with the Xbox Series S' memory limitations.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chinese social media platform Weibo</a> (for which we're using machine translation), Feng Ji says that the Series S' 10GB of shared memory would make a&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>port impossible without "several years of optimization experience".</p>

<p>That's despite Microsoft itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stating back in September</a> that "platform limitations" were not the reason behind the game's Xbox delay, sparking rumors that the game was subject to an undisclosed exclusivity deal between Sony and developer GameScience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s-boss.jpg?itok=Ofw61xPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s-boss.jpg?itok=ZHI6vf-1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s Xbox port has apparently been delayed for so long due to the Series S' memory limitations.</figcaption></figure><p>It's perhaps not a surprise that Feng Ji has come forward to say this. The producer and GameScience CEO is garnering something of a reputation for controversial statements.</p>

<p>Around the time of the Game Awards, Feng Ji <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticized the ceremony</a> for not awarding&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>the prestigious Game of the Year prize, which instead went to PlayStation platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>. He said he'd prepared his acceptance speech two years prior and seemingly wrote that he "came here for nothing".</p>

<p>This time around, Feng Ji could either be calling out the Series S for its memory limitations or describing his own team's lack of optimization experience, both of which seem to be contributing to the&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>Xbox port being so long in the making.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like we're not going to be seeing&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>gracing the Xbox anytime soon, unfortunately. Better make do with the PC or PS5 versions for now.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action-adventure game with Soulslike elements developed by Chinese studio GameScience.</p>

<p>The game is heavily inspired by the classical Chinese novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>, although it's not a direct retelling of that story. Instead, it tells the tale of the Destined One, a simian warrior who must ascend to claim the monkey king Wukong's mantle.</p>

<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>proved massively popular on release, topping the Steam charts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count" rel="nofollow">within a handful of hours</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m" rel="nofollow">passing the 18 million sales milestone</a> just a few weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. Whether or not it eventually does land on Xbox seems to be a matter for debate at the moment, so while you wait, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">check out my review</a> to see what I thought of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p>

Asus, Samsung, and MSI are all announcing the industry’s next-generation QD-OLED gaming monitors that offer the benefits of 4K OLED 240Hz panels at the smaller 27-inch size instead of 32 inches.</p><p>All three appear to be using the same fourth generation QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display, which Asus says offers “a longer lifespan over previous-gen OLEDs.” Both the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-swift-oled-pg27ucdm/">Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM</a> and the <a href="https://www.msi.com/Monitor/MPG-272URX-QD-OLED">MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED</a> (who names these things?) include DisplayPort 2.1a (UHBR20), which offers 80Gbps of bandwidth to support 4K at 240Hz without the need for Display Stream Compression (DSC). <a href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/%ec%82%bc%ec%84%b1%ec%a0%84%ec%9e%90-ces-2025%ec%84%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%8b%88%ed%84%b0-%ec%8b%a0%eb%aa%a8%eb%8d%b8-5%ec%a2%85-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c?utm_source=nr_twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Samsung’s press release</a> about its Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF) doesn’t mention DisplayPort 2.1a compatibility, but it’s reasonable to assume it’s part of the spec list.</p><div><figcaption><em>Asus’ latest OLED monitor has a 26.5-inch viewable display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Samsung’s Odyssey G8 now comes in a 27-inch OLED 4K 240Hz variant.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Samsung</cite></p></div><p>MSI and Asus’ models both support DisplayHDR True Black 400, and Asus also supports Dolby Vision HDR. Both MSI and Asus are offering a three-year warranty that includes burn-in protection, but Samsung hasn’t confirmed its warranty situation for its latest G8 model. Samsung also hasn’t fully detailed the specs of its latest G8 OLED model, but it’s reasonable to assume it will support DisplayHDR True Black 400 at the minimum.</p><p>Interestingly, Asus’ model only has a 26.5-inch viewable display, but both MSI and Samsung are marketing their monitors as 27-inch ones. With all three offering the 0.03ms response times of OLED, 240Hz refresh rates, and above 160PPI for improved text clarity, the choice will really come down to design, features, and pricing. Unfortunately, Samsung, Asus, and MSI haven’t announced release dates or pricing yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arrowhead-studios%E2%80%99-cco-speaks-out-against-forcing-%E2%80%98dei%E2%80%99-into-games.1072617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arrowhead-studios-cco-dei-comments/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent social media post, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO and the creative director of Helldivers 2, Johan Pilestedt, revealed he’s working on the high concept for the studio’s next game. Under the post, he engaged in a brief discussion regarding ‘DEI’ and the act of ‘shoehorning’ it into a game <em>just to have it there</em>.</p>



<p>The comments drew a mix of feedback from the community, with some praising Pilestedt’s transparency while others pointed out some potential flaws with what he said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-pursuit-of-amazing-moments">‘Pure Pursuit of Amazing Moments’</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned heads when it was released in February 2024, with the game going on to sell millions of copies with ease. It had a rocky moment when it was review-bombed following a change on PC that required users to have and link a PSN account to play the game, but that wrong was righted quickly enough.</p>



<p>Now, Arrowhead Studios is preparing to piece together something new, and Johan Pilestedt is working on the concept for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the CCO revealed just that, and in the comments, he engaged with the community. One user made a bold statement: ‘Never add DEI to your games.’</p>



<p>Instead of ignoring the comment, <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1874271801146302738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pilestedt went in with solid responses</a> that kickstarted a wave of comments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If it doesnt add to the game experience, it detracts. And games should be a pure pursuit of amazing moments.</p>



<p>I don’t like labels. But mankind is united in its extreme xenophobia on Super Earth. #Inclusion so, maybe that’s DEI? I really don’t care. </p>



<p>Make good games, don’t make a contemporary political statement.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some users were quick to point out that Helldivers 2’s ‘entire setting is a political statement’, while others maintained the stance that Helldivers 2 is more satirical and rooted in absurdism than anything else.</p>



<p>What we can take away from Pilestedt’s comments is that adding DEI elements to a game just to ‘tick a box’ is wrong if it doesn’t add value to the game. In that case, it’s <strong>detracting </strong>value and serves no purpose, potentially spoiling the ‘pure pursuit of amazing moments’. </p>



<p>His latter comment suggests that games with these ‘contemporary political statements’ are inherently ‘not good’.</p>



<p>One game that was heavily criticised under topics like this in recent years was The Last of Us Part II. That game featured two lead female characters, one of whom was outwardly gay, and had a relatively major storyline concerning a trans character. These topics were targeted quite severely by review bombers angry at the game being ‘woke’ and forcing these elements on players.</p>



<p>But The Last of Us Part II is one of the most highly awarded games in history, so perhaps you can make a good game that also makes contemporary political or cultural statements.</p>

<p>A recent social media post confirmed that Helldivers 2’s developer, Arrowhead Studios, is fleshing out the concept for its next game. On Twitter, Johan Pilestedt, the creative director behind Helldivers 2, mentioned that he’s ‘working on the high concept’ and invited community speculation about the project.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was released almost a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception. The game went on to sell millions of copies and win awards throughout the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-arrowhead">What’s Next for Arrowhead?</h2>



<p>Arrowhead Studios is busying itself with whatever comes next after Helldivers 2, with the firm’s CCO drawing up plans for an all-new project.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a>, Pilestedt wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With 10 minutes to 2025. What are your expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be? I am working on the high concept, but I would love to hear your speculation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pilestedt went on to engage with the community in the comments under the post, many of whom were eagerly pitching their own ideas to the creative director of one of 2024’s most surprising smash hits.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘I would absolutely love to see what Arrowhead could do with a remake of the retro twin-stick shooter “Smash TV”. So much atmosphere in that game!’</p>



<p>By way of a response, Pilestedt revealed that such a game was pitched ‘a long time ago’, sharing an image that contained a blurb for a proposed game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Smash-TV is a top-down reiminaging of the classic arcade game of 1990. The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game-shows.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that Arrowhead pieced together a concept for a first-person, on-rails game akin to Star Fox.</p>

            <p>
Images that look to have been taken inside Rockstar's San Diego office have been posted online, showing a computer screen with what appears to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> running. 
</p>
<p>
As a video game leak, the purported image of GTA 6 itself is essentially meaningless - it simply shows main character Lucia standing next to a wall and some crates. What's more, the image appears to date from the summer of 2021, three and a half years ago.
</p>
<p>
What's unusual here is that the image has been taken within the bowels of Rockstar's own offices, and posted online by someone who seems happy enough to live with the consequences. 
</p>
<p>
The photo and two accompanying video clips, which show a brief glimpse at more of the office surroundings, were first posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F98ox9ku1jfae1.jpeg">reddit</a> by user JustLovett0 around 17 hours ago. "Someone I am close to took it when they worked at the Rockstar office for a few months," they wrote of the image, on a post titled "a photo from mid-2021. I think it's been long enough I can post this."
</p>
<p>
What's shown of the office itself looks relatively generic, though it's clearly the Rockstar San Diego building based on the shape of the windows and frontage that can be seen outside. 
</p>
<p>
Desks nearby house PlayStation and Xbox developer kits, one of which is labelled with a code beginning "SAND", presumably a reference to San Diego.
</p>
<p>
When asked whether their friend was worried about being traced, JustLovett0 wrote: "He is super far from Rockstar now, doesn't work there or in any related field. I'm not worried but I'll probably delete the post soon enough.
</p>
<p>
"Hopefully there's no camera footage from 3.5ish years ago."
</p>
<p>
The post has since been removed, though has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hratml/reupload_of_the_guys_gta_6_leaked_photo_vids_from/">reuploaded</a> elsewhere on reddit. Eurogamer has contacted Rockstar for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Back in September 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">a teenage hacker from the UK stole an enormous swathe of in-development GTA 6 footage and files</a>. The now-notorious leak remains one of the most prominent in video game history. Its culprit was later arrested, though was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-gta-6-hacker-given-indefinite-hospital-order">ultimately deemed unfit to stand trial</a>.

			<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1874763185238274517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1874763185238274517%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a Chinese app, NetEase's free-to-play third-person hero shooter game Marvel Rivals will add the Fantastic Four (Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing) to its playable roster next week. The launch is reportedly happening on Friday, January 10.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched last month to great player figures <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and consoles. Overall, the game has already passed the mark of 20 million players engaged across all platforms, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked highly</a> on player charts in the United States for the final week of the year. So far, the game includes the following playable heroes (and villains):</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Doctor Strange</li>
<li>Groot</li>
<li>The Punisher</li>
<li>Hela</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Loki</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Mantis</li>
<li>Peni Parker</li>
<li>Magneto</li>
<li>Magik</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Scarlet Witch</li>
<li>Star-Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Luna Snow</li>
<li>Hulk</li>
<li>Namor</li>
<li>Adam Warlock</li>
<li>Jeff the Land Shark</li>
<li>Thor</li>
<li>Black Widow</li>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Cloak and Dagger</li>
<li>Hawkeye</li>
<li>Iron Fist</li>
<li>Moon Knight</li>
<li>Psylocke</li>
<li>Squirrel Girl</li>
<li>Winter Soldier</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
</ul>
<p>With the leaked addition of the Fantastic Four, the roster would grow to 37 playable characters, and that's just in the first season of the game's live service. NetEase no doubt has a lot more characters planned to add in the coming months and years, provided that Marvel Rivals continues to do well. While the current list already includes the most popular heroes and villains, there's still a lot of characters left to introduce from the vast universe built over the past eighty years or so. Just off the top of our head, Deadpool, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Kingpin, Green Goblin, Drax, Gamora, Nebula, Ghost Rider, Ant-Man, Luke Cage, Agatha Harkness, Miss Marvel, Red Guardian, Vision, Colossus, Cyclops, Gambit, and Sabretooth are just some of the potential upcoming entries.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps3-native-emulation-researched/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Native emulation of PlayStation 3 games on PlayStation 5 could become a reality in the future, as the possibility is reportedly being researched and prototyped.</p>
<p>Developer Implicit Conversions, the studio handling the PlayStation Classics ports on PlayStation 5,&nbsp;<span>lists on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> a roadmap&nbsp;</span>that it is researching and prototyping the possibility of a PlayStation 3 emulator package for Syrup, the engine that powers the other PS Classics ports. The "Dreaming About" tag, however, suggests that native PS3 emulation could be years away.</p>
<p>As of now, the PlayStation 3 Classics games available on PlayStation 5 with a PS Plus Premium subscription are only playable via cloud gaming, but there's little doubt that the current generation system from Sony is more than capable of emulating PS3 games natively. A test conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-capable-emulating-playstation-3/">last month</a> using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, confirmed how the PS5 hardware would have little trouble running emulated PS3 games, as tested games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well and at a higher than native resolution, even with some hardware limitations, such as memory limitations caused by some driver issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, PlayStation 5 users can enjoy a selection of PlayStation 3 games via cloud gaming as part of the PS Plus Premium subscription. More information on this subscription can be found <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">here.</a></p>

It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient "Chinese-style" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bustling-world">The Bustling World</a>. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

That's a slice from the game's minutiae. At its most expansive, The Bustling World threatens to become a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game: you can take charge of factions, lead armies, design houses, build cities of your own, and organise production chains into - my goodness, it sounds like they're trying to make it a factory sim as well? "Bustling" is certainly the word. "Bursting" might be more appropriate. "Breaking" seems like a possibility. This is a cross-genre pudding of fearful, perhaps ill-advised scale. The trailer proudly advertises itself as real-time and in-engine, but I can't quite believe they're going to pull it all off.
</p>
<p>
The Bustling World - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2724650/The_Bustling_World/">Steam page here</a> - is the work of Chinese developers FireWo Games, with Lightning Games publishing. It doesn't appear to have a core storyline. Instead, you play a nameless everyperson who can either carry on being a nameless everyperson or evolve into a proper MC with globe-straddling aspirations.

"In this ancient world, limitless possibilities await," comments the press release. "You can choose to lead a tranquil life--work, engage in trade, and build a family. Alternatively, satisfy your insatiable desires for wealth, status, and military might. Embark on daring journeys, exploring, adventuring, solving mysteries, combating bandits, and recruiting heroes. Or, aim for the peak of power through establishing influence, city planning, policy formulation, diplomatic endeavors, and territorial expansion."
</p>
<p>
The game promises "dozens of diverse maps, ranging from peaceful villages to strategic border fortresses" and a few special locations that blend "historical landmarks and mythology - like Xiaoxitian and the Underworld". There's a building system with "over 2,000 authentic components, enabling players to design and decorate with ancient Chinese furniture, tools, and artwork", plus a farming element with "over 60 varieties of typical plants from ancient times", each of which requires a certain soil type and temperature. 
</p>
<p>
You might also form bonds with "more than 30 creatures", training them up as mounts and selectively breeding them. But perhaps you'd rather set up a metallurgy business, hiring workers, opening branches, and doing promotion while sabotaging rival businesses at night. Or perhaps you'd rather be a diplomat. Or a black market dealer with a grappling hook. Or a wandering martial artist. Or a general with their own chariot and a retinue of catapults. Or a ravenous amalgamation of all these things.

I am deeply suspicious that all of this will work quite as promised, especially "in a world where every choice ripples through the tapestry of the game" and NPCs, "driven by their unique character traits and familial ties, dynamically shape the cityscape based on players' interactions" - they're apparently capable of building their own houses and running their own businesses, and they'll undertake more personal behaviours like fleeing warzones and avenging slain loved ones. That's a lot of cause-and-effect to thread together.
</p><p>
The Bustling World does not have a release date yet. I'm not sure how long it's been in development, but this feels like it needs to be a "ready when it's ready" gig of the sort Hooded Horse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">like to fund</a>, perhaps even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-one-of-the-most-exciting-development-projects-in-pc-gaming-hit-10-this-week">Caves of Qud</a>-style decade+ marathon. It's not being advertised as an early access game, and I haven't been able to discover how large FireWo Games are. I hope they've got resources and people to spare.
</p>
<p>
In trailer form, at least, The Bustling World is a treat for the eyes and synapses, a lavish historical ant farm in which every NPC looks like they'd be worth shadowing. My favourites from the video are the kids - will they eventually grow into adults? It seems consistent with the premise - all of whom bounce along with the same carefree gait, whether they're attending a lion dance or trampling fish guts on the dock. Ah, my sweet summer children. You will have troubles aplenty when I found my empire of textile sweatshops.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>'s director has appeared to contradict Microsoft, stating the game's Xbox delay is due to the Series S's memory limitations. This is something that the Xbox maker has previously denied.</p>
<p>Writing on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223">Weibo</a>, Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji said the Xbox Series S's memory is the reason behind the game's delay on Microsoft's consoles. Lamenting Black Myth: Wukong's absence on Xbox in an otherwise good year for the studio (it recently scooped up a number of awards at the Steam Awards), the director wrote:</p>
<p>"But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience" (translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukongs-game-director-blames-the-xbox-series-s-10gb-of-memory-for-the-xbox-version-being-delayed.1072326/">ResetEra</a>).</p>

<p>In September of last year however, Microsoft said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">delay to the game's Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong was <em>not </em>due to "platform limitations"</a>. At this time, there was also chatter that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">Black Myth: Wukong team had entered into an undisclosed exclusivity deal with PlayStation</a>.</p><p>"As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms," Microsoft said at the time. "We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to both Xbox and Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science for clarification on the game's Xbox delay.</p>

            <p>What difficulty are you on, <a href="https://doom-captcha.vercel.app/">Doom CAPTCHA</a>? I want to know because I need to know how bad to feel about myself. Six times I’ve tried to pass your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> test by killing three monsters to prove I’m human. Six times I’ve failed. For thousands of years, people have asked what it means to be human. It turns out it was never a philosophical issue after all. It was, I’m gutted to report, a skill issue all along.</p>

<p>It’s a fun concept, nonetheless, although it doesn’t really have the same effect removed from the context of an actual website. If I’d encountered it after trying to log on to do taxes, for example, it’d really stand apart from the usual fare asking you to identify all the buses you’d most like to lick or whatever. Sadly, you’re unlikely to see this one in the wild, as it’s really just an elaborate advertisement for frontend-as-a-service product <a href="https://x.com/vercel">Vercel</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/01/people-are-playing-a-new-doom-themed-captcha/">TechCrunch</a>). It’s also one that’s been done before, albeit <a href="https://vivirenremoto.github.io/doomcaptcha/">in a different form</a> that I actually found far more playable.</p>
<p>As is customary whenever Doom On A Thing occurs, I must now list all previous instances of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/can-it-run-doom">Doom On A Thing</a> RPS have covered in the past. Partly to uphold tradition, but mostly to spur on venomous comment discourse over what really counts as ‘running’ Doom.

			<p>The Xbox Series S' 10 GB of RAM and developer Game Science's current experience in optimization are apparently the reasons why Black Myth: Wukong has yet to be released on Microsoft's current-generation systems and not any sort of console exclusivity agreement.</p>
<p>Speaking on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weibo</a>, Game Science CEO and Game Director Feng Ji commented on the action role-playing game receiving multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a>, including Game of the Year and Outstanding Story-Rich awards, saying that the only thing that is missing for the game is launching on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. While it feels wrong the game still isn't out on the two Microsoft systems, the Black Myth: Wukong director added that with 10 GB of shared memory, without a few years of optimization experience, there's nothing to be done about the matter.</p>
<p>Given how Black Myth: Wukong struggles to run well on the more powerful Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5, requiring frame generation to hit acceptable performance in some scenarios, the game's directors' statements aren't particularly surprising, although, on paper, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/">Xbox Series S hardware shouldn't be challenged by the game</a>. Hopefully, the Chinese studio will be able to improve their optimization capabilities quickly and finally release their game on Xbox consoles, as it's definitely worth experiencing for the vast majority of players, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

That list included details on a version of Half-Life 3 that was in development for around a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.alyxfinalhours.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Geoff Keighley's The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx</u></a> revealed that at least five Half-Life games were canceled between Episode 2 and Alyx, along with a number of other projects — the most notable of which was referred to within Valve as Half-Life 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/never-before-seen-half-life-2-episode-3-gameplay-footage-and-ice-gun-revealed-in-new-documentary">Valve opened up about its development</a> in a documentary that revealed never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had completed a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has plenty on its plate already, of course, including ongoing support of Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Steam itself, the Steam Deck, and new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>. Could it also be working on Half-Life 3 alongside all those other projects?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The Series S has 4TF of GPU compute compared to the Xbox Series X’s 12.2TF, but the killer is the drop in memory allocation, from 16GB down to 10GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s Xbox release policy means publishers and developers must release their games across Xbox Series X and S. They are unable to release a game for Xbox Series X only, for example. This has caused difficulty for some studios in the past, perhaps most notably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> developer Larian. Baldur's Gate 3 was originally released on PC and PS5 only, with the Xbox version delayed due to issues with the Xbox Series S specifically struggling to perform splitscreen co-op. In the past, Xbox had committed to parity between Xbox Series S and X for all games, but it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-wins-big-concession-allowing-it-to-launch-on-xbox-in-2023"><u>ultimately made an exception for Baldur's Gate 3</u></a> so the game could launch later in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-opens-up-about-challenges-developing-alan-wake-2-for-xbox-series-s">talked openly about the challenge the studio faced getting Alan Wake 2 running well on the Xbox Series S</a>, saying the console’s GPU “is an issue” and “having less memory is a pretty big problem.” Before then, a VFX artist who had worked on an Xbox Series X and S game said in a now-deleted tweet that “many developers have been sitting in meetings for the past year desperately trying to get Series S launch requirements dropped”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Studios have been through one development cycle where Series S turned out to be an albatross around the neck of production, and now that games are firmly being developed with new consoles in mind, teams do not want to repeat the process,” the developer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews with press including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-insists-games-launch-across-xbox-series-x-and-s-despite-baldurs-gate-3-no-show"><u>IGN</u></a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has deflected questions about whether Xbox Series S is holding developers back, and rejected calls for developers to be allowed to release their games on Xbox Series X only. In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-definitive-xbox-gamescom-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>, Spencer said: "Having an entry-level price point for a sub-$300 console is a good thing for the industry. I think it's important. The Switch has been able to do that, in terms of kind of the traditional plug-into-my-television consoles. I think it's important. So, we're committed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation with Black Myth: Wukong, however, is further muddled by Microsoft’s insistence that the game’s delay on Xbox has nothing to do with development issues. In a number of statements issued to IGN, Microsoft has suggested an exclusivity deal with Sony was the cause of the delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X and S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” Microsoft has told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong launched on August 19 and sold an eye-watering 18 million copies in just two weeks across PC and PS5, reportedly making over $700 million in revenue in the process. That was enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development. It did so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-points-to-black-myth-wukong-success-in-big-playstation-quarter-after-concord-disaster"><u>Sony pointed to Black Myth: Wukong as making a significant contribution to revenue</u></a> during its last financial quarter, making up for the Concord disaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DLC is set to follow. In September, Game Science investor Hero Games confirmed plans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-following-elden-rings-lead-with-dlc-expansion-before-any-sequel"><u>to release an Elden Ring-style expansion for Black Myth: Wukong ahead of any sequel</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>Black Myth: Wukong review</u></a> returned an 8/10.

New year, new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks. While Nintendo's plans for its Switch successor remain officially under wraps, a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12182966?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwNGIxYTliMS1lNTFjLTQ3OTktOWU0OS05OTE4ODk1MzQ3ZWQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2MDkzNTYxMy1jNDg1LTRiMTUtYWZmMi02NzZhMDliNmZiZWMiLCJleHAiOjB9">patent</a> from the company has surfaced detailing plans to use upscaling technology to cram games with up to 4K textures onto physical game cartridges. 
</p>
<p>
The patent describes technology similar to Nvidia's DLSS, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>'s baked in PSSR, to upscale images using AI. A key advantage listed here is to decrease the size of games that would otherwise include hefty 4K-native assets. This helps keep download sizes small, and also allows for these games to fit onto moderately-sized physical media.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's patent dates from July 2023, but was only published publicly this week. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3leooutc5sk26">highlighted</a> by industry consultant Laura Kate Dale, the patent suggests "a game with native 4K textures might need a 60GB download, but a 1080-native version might only need 20GB (which would allow it to fit on a 32GB Switch cart, the current max size)".
</p>
<p>
The news comes as a fresh leak shows our best look yet at what appears to be the Switch 2's internal components. The images tally with what we know about the size and internal makeup of the device already from past leaks - including an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">earlier glimpse at the Switch 2's motherboard</a>, and the suggestion the console will have a second USB port at the top of the device.
</p>

Nintendo has previously said it will announce Switch 2 before the end of its current financial year, on 31st March. But much of the console's design can now be assumed - all signs point to it being a slightly larger version of the current Switch, with magnetic Joy-Con and a mysterious new "C" button on the right Joy-Con.
</p><p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense,"  industry analyst Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">told Eurogamer last month</a>. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Leaked Motherboard Analysis Suggests SoC Uses Samsung 5nm Node; NVIDIA DLSS 4K Upscaling Mentioned in New Patent]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-motherboard-analysis-suggests-soc-uses-samsung-5nm-node-nvidia-dlss-4k-upscaling-mentioned-in-new-patent.1072545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 SoC likely uses Samsung 5nm node instead of the 8nm node, according to a new analysis of the SoC seen on the leaked motherboard.</p>
<p>Following the release of the pictures showcasing the next Nintendo system's motherboard <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/">yesterday</a>, multiple users have been looking at the components to try and understand more about the console before its official reveal. According to an analysis posted on Famiiboards, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hr5w0j/famiboards_users_analyzed_the_die_and_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, there is enough evidence to suggest the Switch 2 SoC uses a Samsung 5nm process node and not an 8nm process node. The T239 chip that powers the system is said to feature around 15 billion transistors, which would be 326mm^2 on the 8nm process node, a bigger size than the chip seen on the leaked motherboard. The T239 chip, on the other hand, is around 200mm^2, which lines up not only with the Samsung 5nm node used for the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chip but with the timeline as well, as the Snapdragon chip was released in late 2021, and the first T239 engineering samples came in April 2022. If this is true, it definitely bodes well for the system's performance level.</p>
<p>One more Nintendo Switch 2 feature that has been rumored for a long time but has yet to be officially confirmed is NVIDIA DLSS support. A new patent from Nintendo, spotted by Laura Kate Dale, which was filed in the United States <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12182966?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwNGIxYTliMS1lNTFjLTQ3OTktOWU0OS05OTE4ODk1MzQ3ZWQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2MDkzNTYxMy1jNDg1LTRiMTUtYWZmMi02NzZhMDliNmZiZWMiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this week</a>, strongly suggests that the console will indeed support NVIDIA's AI-powered upscaler, whose main goal, besides upscaling to 1080p and 4K resolutions from much input lower resolutions, would also be to keep file sizes low, considering one of the examples given in the patent itself which mentions the different file sizes between 4K resolution and 1080p resolution textures.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ed4465al7bf2r7a6p2lb5xr6/app.bsky.feed.post/3leoosfwsuk26" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidostsxccogbl2zspubihajm7ju7bs4h3sj4sju67zur566rzoofi">
<p lang="en">Another new Nintendo patent published yesterday seems to yet again verify claims the Switch 2 will use DLSS style AI upscaling (Nvidia chip) to improve output resolution for games, rather than trying to natively run them at higher internal resolutions.</p>

<p>With leaks becoming more frequent and accurate, the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal is bound to be imminent. Hopefully, the Japanese company will soon finally reveal what has become one of the worst-kept secrets of the past few years.</p>
