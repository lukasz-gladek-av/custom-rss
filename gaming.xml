			<p>STALKER 2 is an extremely demanding game from both a CPU and GPU standpoint, pushing a powerful CPU like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-positions-ryzen-7-9800x3d-competition-against-intel-top-core-i9-14900ks-gaming-cpu/">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> to its limits so much that it struggles to hit very high framerates at low resolutions.</p>
<p>A new benchmark shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compusemble</a> highlights how demanding the second entry in the series by GSC Game World is, especially on the CPU. In the two scenarios the benchmark is set, both of them extremely CPU intensive, a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU struggles to hit a 100 FPS average even at 1080p resolution. At a higher resolution, such as 4K, the AMD CPU also struggles to keep a steady 60 FPS in both benchmarking scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="STALKER 2 Benchmark From 4K to 720p - How Does It Scale With Resolution? RTX 4090 &amp; Ryzen 7 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmRMU9Y9PFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Performance concerns on both PC and consoles haven't stopped fans from purchasing the game, as STALKER 2 managed to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/">1 million units</a> in just a few days of availability. While the game stays true to its predecessor and its premise, the game by GSC Game World isn't exactly a game for every sort of player, as Alessio highlighted in his review-in-progress.</p>
<p><em>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also part of the Xbox Game Pass library on both PC and consoles.</p>

That’s perfectly fine too. Keep following us and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year.”</p><p>What might those surprises be? Current fan speculation points to upcoming DLC and a potential Xbox Series X/S port. Daniel Wu, the CEO of Hero Games, Game Science’s biggest investor, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansion-release-date-1851649348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansion-release-date-1851649348">previously claimed</a></span> an expansion was already in development, with some analysts guessing the DLC might arrive in time for the Chinese New Year at the end of January 2025. More recently, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1frwxmk/gs_ceo_feng_ji_formally_answered_on_the_matter_of/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1frwxmk/gs_ceo_feng_ji_formally_answered_on_the_matter_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feng Ji said</a></span> that if fans expect an expansion to be of the same quality as the base game, it could take a while. </p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> coming to Xbox next month seems like a more sure bet. After much back-and-forth about whether the Chinese blockbuster was an unofficial PlayStation 5 exclusive, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-black-myth-wukong-leaked-phil-spencer-confirmed-1851697689?_gl=1*18spot8*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI4Njg2My4xMi4xLjE3MzIyODc5MTQuNTIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-black-myth-wukong-leaked-phil-spencer-confirmed-1851697689?_gl=1*18spot8*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI4Njg2My4xMi4xLjE3MzIyODc5MTQuNTIuMC4w">recently told <em>Game File</em></a></span> that he knew whether or not the game would arrive on his platform but wouldn’t spill the beans. </p><p>One possibility is that we’ll get an announcement at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards on December 12 revealing that <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has just been shadow-dropped on Xbox Series X/S. That’s what happened last year with <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. <em>Wukong </em>is also nominated for Best Game at the TGAs, where it could continue its current winning streak. </p><p>Feng Ji does say “surprises” plural, so maybe Game Science has something else planned as well. While <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>reportedly runs better on the recently released PS5 Pro thanks to its beefier specs, it would also be nice to see the visually impressive game get an official Pro enhanced mode. That patch could be another thing the studio is planning before the end of 2024. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sure, you could play Palworld. It’s sort of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative to the famous monster-catching franchise</a>, albeit with more automation and firearms. Or, if you grew up playing handheld monster-catching titles, you probably want something more retro, old-school nostalgia to strike that itch. Well, a new Pokemon alternative out on PC, Dokimon: Quest, looks phenomenal!</p>



<h2 id="h-dokimon-quest-is-out-now-on-pc">Dokimon: Quest is Out Now on PC</h2>



<p>Dokimon: Quest, by developer Yanako RPGs, is the first of its kind for the studio. Its previous title, Notice Me Leena-Senpai, is an anime 2D tower defense game that launched in December 2023 in Early Access. It’s still in Early Access, albeit with an official release date coming up shortly. But for now, let’s talk about Dokimon. </p>



<p>First and foremost, it’s available today on Steam as a full release for $19.99 with a limited-time launch discount, bringing the total price down to $17.99.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-dokimon-quest">What is Dokimon: Quest?</h2>



<p>Dokimon: Quest is a retro RPG with an old-school aesthetic that mimics the turn-based battle style and monster-catching and collecting mechanics of everyone’s favorite Pokemon. </p>



<p>The adventure takes place across the Xelos region, a fantasy world in which monsters known as Dokimon roam, along with battlers, or trainers, in turn-based monster-catching and battling gameplay that pairs old-school mechanics from the franchise with modern quality-of-life improvements. </p>



<p>Some key features include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Nine playable characters</strong></li>



<li><strong>Four available save slots</strong></li>



<li><strong>Quest log for easy tracking</strong></li>



<li><strong>8bit + Piano OST</strong></li>



<li><strong>20+ Retro Color Palettes</strong></li>



<li><strong>The ability to edit monster stats</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fast-forward battles with a single key</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Following the success of Palworld in the face of Nintendo, I imagine we’ll see plenty more monster-catching titles release in the coming months and years. Do you intend to jump in the seemingly neverending hype train of such titles? Let us know in the comments below if you intend to give Dokimon: Quest a try!</p>



<hr>



<p>There were rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-palworld-going-free-to-play-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld going free-to-play</a>, with microtransactions to support development, but we answer your concerns and questions!</p>

But as usual, none could quite touch the success of Call of Duty, and Black Ops 6 gave the franchise another debut at No.1 even with its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This information comes from Circana's monthly report on U.S. video game spending by dollar sales, which saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> drive overall video game spending up 10% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, per an analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella. It was the best-selling game of the month and is already the third best-selling game of the year to-date. In its first two weeks, Black Ops 6 sales were 23% higher than last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">Modern Warfare 3</a> sales over the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, a whopping 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 full dollar sales were on PlayStation 5. But that shouldn't come as a surprise - this number counts full game purchases, and with Black Ops 6 appearing on Game Pass, it's likely most Xbox users took that route instead. But Circana also reports that non-mobile video game subscription spending industry-wide was up 16% year-over-year in October, and this was largely due to Black Ops 6 driving new Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Black Ops 6 on the sales charts was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, which is now the fourth best-selling game of the year so far, the best-selling Dragon Ball game in the U.S., and the third best-selling Bandai Namco game in history. Only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> have done better from Bandai's portfolio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third was the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, which is also officially the second best-selling Silent Hill game ever. It's beaten by, funnily enough, the original Silent Hill 2. BioWare's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> debuted at No.6 after launching on the last day of the month, but was beaten out by both Plaion's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undisputed">Undisputed</a> at No.4 and fellow RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> at No.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few other interesting titles popped into the U.S. charts this month. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection</a> climbed from 90 last month to 19 this month perhaps due to a recent sale on the Nintendo Switch that dropped the price from a whopping $75 to nearly $55 (it's still going on!). Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> soared from No.502 last month to No.9 on the Xbox top monthly active users chart, thanks to its recent addition to Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware sales, it was an unsurprisingly less stellar month. Hardware spending was down 23% year-over-year, with Switch sales down 38%, PS5 down 20%, and Xbox Series down 18%. PS5 remains the best-selling hardware in both unit and dollar sales, and Xbox followed in second as the Switch nears the end of its lifecycle. Over in accessories, the PlayStation Portal was the best-selling item, and accessories spending was up 15%. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Black Friday sales</a> are also now live, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-black-friday-2024">Xbox leading with plenty of deals</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Here are the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. for the month of October, based on dollar sales:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank You, stalkers!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl hit the one million sold milestone less than 48 hours after launching across PC and Xbox Series X and S. On Steam, it has a peak concurrent player count of 117,928, putting it among the most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft does not make Xbox player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is already a success for GSC even before its first weekend on sale. However, the launch is not without problems, with players reporting a variety of bugs (check out IGN's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 review in progress to find out more). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-launches-big-on-steam-as-dev-promises-fixes-for-rough-edges">GSC has promised to sort out what it called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s "rough edges"</a> with a steady stream of patches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free in-game content is also coming to the game. Expect more on that when GSC Game World shares its roadmap later in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</u></a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2"><u>Things to Do First in Stalker 2</u></a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You"><u>Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</u></a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing.

GSC said at the time that the extra two months would give the developers the chance to fix "unexpected anomalies," aka bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC has also been vocal about the challenges the studio faced getting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 up to scratch after a mixed reaction to its debut public showing last year. At gamescom 2023, GSC addressed what some had called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-devs-discuss-imperfect-gamescom-2023-demo-address-downgrade-debate"><u>a “downgrade” sparked by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s then latest gameplay trailer</u></a>. At the time, GSC told IGN it was still targeting a visual quality and level of polish suggested by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s eye-catching 2021 trailer despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stalker-2-developers-say-the-war-in-ukraine-russian-hackers-and-death-threats-wont-break-them"><u>the horrendous conditions suffered by the staff amid the war with Russia</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl launched on November 20 after years of development, and it seems to be off to a solid start. Developer GSC Game World announced that the first-person survival game has cleared 1 million copies sold across PC and Xbox, but that doesn't tell the entire story of how many people have played it.</p><p>In its statement, GSC said that in addition to the 1 million sales, "much more stalkers" have joined in thanks to Game Pass. The studio did not specify how many people are playing on Game Pass, however.</p><p>There is an ongoing discussion about whether or not releasing on Game Pass at launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">negatively impacts sales</a>.

For Stalker 2, we don't know anything about the budget, sales projections, break-even points, or anything else. Whether or not 1 million sales for Stalker 2 is a good number is unknown, but it's something that GSC is celebrating publicly.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859930792564285907" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No wonder it feels a bit crowdy in the Zone.

The game was in fact <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-canceled/1100-6373393/" data-ref-id="1100-6373393">canceled in 2012</a>, but later reemerged and was eventually made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>Stalker 2 was later reassigned a 2022 release date, but the game's development was halted following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where the studio has offices. It later shifted to September 2024 before getting delayed once more to November 20, a date that stuck.</p><p>In addition to being available for outright purchase, Stalker 2 is available as part of Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since its release in 2023, Baldur's Gate 3 has taken the world by storm. It isn't much of a surprise, really, considering how much content and customization there is, as well as some truly lovable (and hateable) characters that you can romance or kill. The main thing is that most things in the game are completely up to you, and you can choose to play the game in a myriad of ways, with each playthrough having the potential to be different from the previous one. When it comes to single-player RPGs, they tend to die off relatively quickly, as people will have completed the story shortly after it comes out. However, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to remain healthy, with a strong and consistent player base. According to Larian's Director of Publishing, Michael Douse, Baldur's Gate 3 performed better this year than it did in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1859244899847069827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Douse revealed</a> that the daily peak player counts were up by 3% compared to last year, with average daily users up by 20% and average daily Steam Deck users up by 60%. There are many factors that could be contributing to the fact that Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be popular. A lot of it likely revolves around the fact that Larian Studios has had great community support, and has patched the game where it needs, as well as adding new content. Since it was released, the game has received multiple new endings for the main companions, as well as official mod support.</p>
<p>Even Douse has said that mods are a huge reason as to why more people are playing Baldur's Gate 3. While mods were available on PC previously, they didn't have official support from the developers and required a fair few steps to install, which could lead to your game bricking. However, the developers have now added an official mod manager, which allows people to mod their game with ease and makes the removal of them significantly more accessible.</p>
<p>One of the most monumental moves made by Larian was allowing those on console access to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">the mod manager</a>. It's a huge rarity that games on console can get any sort of modding. For example, games like The Sims 4 are notorious for being modded on PC, but that just isn't an option for console players. This was a huge move by Larian and has definitely helped keep the game relevant, as well as their consistent updates to the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honkai-star-rail-version-2-7-release-date-bids-farewell-to-penacony.1042962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.7 release date has been revealed, so get ready to bid farewell to Penacony and embark on a new adventure to lands unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 of the turn-based gacha RPG officially arrives on December 4th. In&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 2.6</a>, you brought the events of a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to their climax, but now, you'll be wrapping things up in Penacony before heading off to the mysterious land of Amphoreus.</p>

<p>As HoYoverse tells it, you'll be making new memories with your friends in Penacony while Miss Himeko gathers information about Amphoreus in preparation for moving the story to the Eternal Land.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=OMjGirLk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.7-release-date-fugue.jpg?itok=LkBMdQK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As ever, you'll have new characters to add to your team in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s latest update.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect if you're a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll have two new characters to add to your roster in Version 2.7.</p>

<p>Your first new character is Sunday, a five-star Imaginary fighter who provides powerful buffs to his team and allows other characters to immediately take action. You'll want to add him to your team if you're looking for some solid support.</p>

<p>Joining Sunday in this update is Fugue, a foxian girl who applies a powerful debuff to enemies. When said debuff reaches zero, enemies take damage, and Fugue's abilities also allow her party members to dish out some extra pain, so she's a valuable addition to any lineup.</p>




<p>Two additional characters will feature in reruns for Version 2.7. In the first half of the update, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-gameplay-trailer-celebrates-release-of-new-character-jing-yuan" rel="nofollow">Jing Yuan</a> will make a return, while the second half will see Firefly once again up for grabs.</p>

<p>A number of other major additions and improvements are set to arrive as part of this update as well, including customizable quarters for the Trailblazer. As HoYoverse prepares for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.0, you'll also get&nbsp;the new Path of Remembrance system and updates to Relics, plus lots more.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Version 2.7 arrives on December 4th.</p>

The game at least introduces this concept to you, but later, when you want to find it again, it’s bizarrely concealed.</p><p>To use the points, you have to do something entirely counter-intuitive: Go as if to open a pack. This is genuinely the only place in the game where you can access the feature, and it’s completely unlabeled too. Once you’ve tapped to open a new pack, next to the three pack arts you can choose from, in a tiny circle at the bottom-right of the screen, there’s a picture of...well, it’s a picture of a zippo lighter. Tap that, and then you can buy cards.

Or a guilty face when your own pack deals you exactly the right cards on your first turn.</p><p>Clearly nothing that can be abused, and obviously nothing that lets you send messages, but just a bunch of emojis would make a big difference. Think of <em>Marvel Snap</em>’s wonderfully expressive options, that end up becoming a bizarre language in and of themselves.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba64446419cb06130a89cfeaf955a5ec" data-recommend-id="image://ba64446419cb06130a89cfeaf955a5ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Have those daily freebies do...something!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Have those daily freebies do...something!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba64446419cb06130a89cfeaf955a5ec" data-recommend-id="image://ba64446419cb06130a89cfeaf955a5ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Have those daily freebies do...something!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Pocket</em>’s daily free items in the Shop are pretty dreadful, but they’re <em>something</em>.

There’s no little animation to show the hourglass and ticket jumping into our inventory, no sparkly flurry of stars that pops out from the screen—it just fades a bit.</p><p>In a game that’s been designed from the ground up to be a dopamine factory, it’s the most weirdly unsatisfactory moment in your daily play. Given what you gain is so miniscule (an hour off the time before your next Wonder Pick, and another shop ticket to add to the pile), we at least need to be given some positive feedback for clicking the button like a good mouse.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-recommend-id="image://06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bigger binders!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bigger binders!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-recommend-id="image://06f28b5ea8e4de53b0f7743e962454c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bigger binders!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve collected any real-life cards from any TCGs, you’ll know that you literally cannot buy a card binder so small that it can only contain 30 cards.

It allows you to see a selection of packs opened by other players, pick one, and then choose one of the five cards at random.</p><p>Of course, you’ll pick a pack that has a card you really want in it, and then have a 20 percent chance of actually getting it. So four times out of five, you don’t get what you wanted. That sucks enough on its own, but the game’s insistence on painfully slowly returning you to the screen to watch the rest of the cards flip over, showing you the location of the card you actually wanted, is miserable.</p><p>Perhaps some people want it, want to know where it would have been, so they can cry, “That was the card I was going to choose! Why did I change my mind!” But sensible people would rather not, and it’d be lovely to have an option to have this moment of mocking torture taken away.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-recommend-id="image://0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Let me battle from my friends list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Let me battle from my friends list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-recommend-id="image://0474b5152e23761776e4416a575d5f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Let me battle from my friends list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Battling random people is very simple, and with a billion-trillion players, you never need to wait for a match. But battling someone specific is currently a more convoluted affair. You need to create a password, and then that other person needs to enter the same password, then you have the game search for others using that word to pair up. It works, and that’s all fine, but it could be <em>so</em> much simpler. There’s a friends list! You can click on profiles of people you’ve befriended, view their battle record, see their emblems, number of cards, and unlocked achievements. But you cannot just click to send a battle request. Which is bonkers.</p><p>So, you know, add that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-recommend-id="image://8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-recommend-id="image://8528ed5192a41ca4148019b20a667e4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fix the whole UI!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What a mess this game is. It’s like new features were added via a game of pin the tail on the donkey, the developers blindfolding themselves before slapping a button or core element into the UI.</p><p>The eight different pages of the Shop, split into three sections, with a page in two of them that’s just completely blank, are indicative of what a muddle everything is. It needs to be screwed up into a ball and thrown away, starting over entirely.</p><p>As mentioned, the option to spend Pack Points is hidden only on the page for opening packs, while buttons to access your own decks appear at random in different places on the screen, in different sections, but then disappear on the sub-pages where you want them most. There are seven different pages of missions (although that goes up and down as events come and go), but for some reason one of them (Themed Collections) is on a button separate from all the other tabs. Absolutely everything is loopy, and it’s far too hard to remember where you’re supposed to go for each disparate element.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-recommend-id="image://b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-recommend-id="image://b35f61335ba97000f6df54b8d4390f6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Make Premium something worth paying for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is where it gets a bit more serious. Of all the strangest choices this deeply strange card game makes, the paid-for Premium Missions are the worst. Asking people for $10 a month, and then offering a handful of desultory tasks with insultingly poor rewards, all easily completed in a couple of days of casual play, feels like a monstrous misstep.</p><p>Rewards are <em>so</em> awful. Giving paying customers a single Pack Hourglass for completing “Open 20 booster packs,” for instance, is gobsmacking. Weeeeeee, a whole hour off before I can open a new pack! However can you afford to be so generous?!</p><p>A battle pass is supposed to be a series of grinds that give players a motivation to keep coming back all season. Sure, there are crazy people who’ll somehow reach level 200 in <em>Fortnite</em> in the first week, but for normies, it’s a long list of rewards given for continued progress, combined with new missions every day, week, and storyline. And it costs less, and lasts three times as long!</p><p>Or for a more direct comparison, look at <em>Marvel Snap</em>. For the fee, you get an enormously long list of unlocks that’ll take you weeks to finish, unlocking the coolest versions of favorite cards, and all manner of other decorative bonuses. In this light, <em>Pocket’s </em>battle pass is outrageous, its embarrassing handful of rewards gained almost immediately (five Mewtwo-themed decorations, and a single Pikachu card), the Premium section of both the Missions and the Shop then just left grayed out and a grim reminder of wasted money for the other 29 days in the month.</p><p>Yes, you get an extra pack a day for this too. That’s not nothing. But it’s also nowhere near enough.</p><p>This desperately needs to be improved, or people are going to bail on it in droves. In fact, the launch version has been so awful that some sort of redress seems in order, an apologetic pile of hourglasses and shop tickets handed to us suckers who forked out in the hope that it would update or improve at some point after the two week free trial.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rollercoaster-tycoon">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> Classic is heading to Switch at the start of next month.</p>
<p>As announced by Atari, the theme park sim will arrive on 5th December, with the Switch version joining its availability on mobile and PC.</p>
<p>The re-release pairs the original RollerCoaster Tycoon with its sequel, bringing updated UI and controls.</p>

<p>These two games are generally considered the best in the series, and even if they're showing their age, their simplicity is charming compared to more recent sim games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's great timing from Atari just after the release of Frontier's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, a game with far more modern enhancements.</p>
<p>Atari is the sole publisher of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, after<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m"> acquiring the rights to the third game from Frontier</a> earlier this year. Atari boss Wade Rosen said at the time this would bring "new opportunities for Atari" and "benefits to the fans of games across the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise".</p>
<p>This Switch release of RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic (not the third game) is the only follow-up news so far, so it's unclear what's in store for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>For an alternative, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-theme-park-management-sim-parkitect-hits-playstation-and-xbox-this-week">Parkitect was released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> earlier this year, following its previous PC release. It's a classic take on the theme park sim genre, akin to RollerCoaster Tycoon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sega-brings-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-to-steam-this-winter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Virtua Fighter is finally making its return to PC with the release of Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. For those who are excited about the return of this beloved franchise, the game is now available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam</a>. This <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-game-is-in-development-sega-confirms/">news comes after Sega confirmed that a new Virtua Fighter</a> game was in the works just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; This title is based on Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown and is set to provide players with an optimized gaming experience. The game will be offering support of 4K60 and is the first game in 13 years to feature balance adjustments. The upcoming title is also set to support rollback netcode, which will allow players who don't have access to a wired connection to enjoy a smoother experience on the battlefield and will allow everyone around the globe to participate in heated battles.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't too many details that are being revealed about Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., as Sega is currently keeping it all under wraps. However, it's been confirmed that a 2.0 update is planned for Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown for those who are playing the game on PlayStation 4. To celebrate the announcement of Virtua Fighter coming to PC, the Opening Cinematic trailer has been released to show off some of the content that players can expect from the upcoming title. The video is just over two and a half minutes long and showcases some of the iconic fighters that will be making an appearance in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="VIRTUA FIGHTER 5 R.E.V.O. - Opening Cinematic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/einEYdj3nAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O will feature all of the beloved classic game modes, such as Arcade and Rank Match, with the ability to create custom online tournaments and leagues with up to 16 players. For those who are trying to become the best with their Kung Fu skills, you can also watch in Spectator Mode so that you can take notes from the battles you are watching.</p>
<p>According to the Steam page of the game, there will be 19 playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style. Of course, like most modern fighting games, you'll be able to customize them with accessories and costumes that make them feel personalized to you.</p>
<p>Along with the Arcade and Rank Match game modes, there will also be the Training and Versus game modes, providing plenty of variety for those who aren't sure what game mode they want to start with.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. when it comes out?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch Online Gets Beloved Game Boy Donkey Kong Platformer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-gets-beloved-game-boy-donkey-kong-platformer.1042911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added another Game Boy game to the Nintendo Switch Online roster, and if you're looking for a platformer to keep you entertained this Thanksgiving, you could do a lot worse than this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>has found its way to the Switch Online library. It joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Land</a></em>, as well as many other Game Boy classics.</p>

<p>Rather intriguingly, the plot for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>sees Cranky Kong and King K. Rool working together in order to get Diddy and Donkey Kong to prove they can successfully embark on an adventure on the Game Boy. It's all very meta.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=VcjDjt5q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-land-nintendo-switch-online.jpg?itok=9U3ysc_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>takes a decidedly more meta approach to proceedings.</figcaption></figure><p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is an entirely original game rather than a remake or port of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>. It features 30 levels across four worlds, and it also features several of the staples of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>platformers, including collecting K-O-N-G letters, firing yourself from barrel cannons, and more.</p>

<p>The game features similar visuals to&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, with developer Rare using the same technology as in the SNES series to transfer pre-rendered graphics into a 2D space.</p>

<p>Despite that, it does also take the Game Boy's limitations into account in some ways; the system is more limited than the SNES from a technical standpoint, for instance, so only one Kong can appear on screen rather than the two of them working in tandem.</p>




<p><em>Donkey Kong Land&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now on Nintendo Switch. All you need is a Switch Online membership; you won't need an Expansion Pack addon like you would to play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/38-nintendo-switch-online-n64-games-are-planned-dataminer-says" rel="nofollow">N64 games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance titles</a>.</p>

<p>Despite several&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>games being made available via Switch Online,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong 64&nbsp;</em>is yet to make its way to the service. We'll have to wait and see whether it does or not in the coming months.</p>

		<p><em>It's often shocking how little changes to a home can have a big impact. You become accustomed to how things are supposed to work because that's the way they've always worked. In reality, you've gotten used to a bad way of doing things—or, at least, there's a better way of doing them.</em></p><p><em>Can life feel lighter by the simple purchase of a wireless vacuum?</em></p><p><em>Does the sun shine a little brighter if your garage closes on its own?</em></p><p><em>One can dream, one home automation at a time.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We got a new vacuum a couple weeks ago. Our venerable Shark bagless vacuum had lost just enough attachments and suffered enough other damage that it was time to consider replacing it, and I was strongly considering returning to the world of old-school vacuum cleaners with their tidy little bags. I’d loved the Shark but there were times I wondered, as I stood in a cloud of gross dust as I emptied its container into a trash can, whether a bagless vacuum cleaner really represented the kind of progress I wanted.</p><p>MK, however, strenuously opposed any move toward a bagged vacuum cleaner or toward just getting another, newer Shark. Her argument was pretty simple: we don’t really have to worry about vacuuming floors or carpets. The place we have trouble is in the corners of our apartment, or the crevices in our furniture. Those are the places we find mice making themselves overly comfortable, or where we see crumbs of food or scraps of dog toys accumulating. We need to be cleaning those areas every day, maybe multiple times a day. The kinds of vacuums I was considering, she argued, were going to fail and fail miserably.</p><p>I’ll spare you the argument we had. Suffice it to say, I didn’t see why we couldn’t just use the attachments that came with the other vacuum cleaners we were considering. The Shark could do all this, so why not just get another one if she was so unmoved by the other options? The answer was simple: because it had cords. And if it had cords, we were never going to use it.</p><p>Patrick, I have to tell you how embarrassingly right this has proven to be. I thought we’d made okay use of our vacuum cleaner, but I’d often find myself saying, “Well we just need to be better about cleaning” every time we realized we were dealing with another mouse incursion. That if we were more conscientious, we’d put the vacuum to work and stay on top of housekeeping the way we needed to. But MK’s insight appears to have been <em>the </em>insight. The simple steps of fishing the vacuum out of the closet, unwinding the power cord, and plugging it in were insurmountable hurdles. Not too bad if we were vacuuming the whole house or even just the whole living room but for just doing a quick spot-clean around the fridge or along the baseboards under the cabinets? It was stopping us dead in our tracks, without even being aware of it. We’d just glance at the floor and think, “That’s not bad” and spare ourselves the whole effort.</p><p>We ended up getting an LG stick vacuum that sits on a big charger stand in the corner of our living room. Truthfully, I don’t love the look of it just sitting there, but on the other hand I can just grab it, vacuum up a bit of kitchen detritus or loose dog kibble before bed, and return it to its charger in the space of about thirty seconds. I don’t even have to empty out its little chamber: the stand has a bag inside it that the vacuum discharges into when it’s replaced on its charger.</p><p>I didn’t think “plugging in a vacuum cleaner” was a hurdle between me and keeping the house clean. Since we got this thing, though, I have to admit it was the <em>entire </em>ballgame. From the standpoint of pure math it makes sense: doing anything with the old vacuum cleaner was going to take about five minutes. Two minutes taking it out and putting it away, a minute emptying the chamber, and then a minute fussing with attachments and cords. If you just need to do 30 seconds of work, four minutes of preparation and storage work is ridiculously wasteful. But I didn’t see it that way. I just felt like my tendency to sloth was causing me to use my nice vacuum cleaner less than I’d have wished.</p><p>Do you have any steps associated with an important chore or task that aren’t that difficult, but you kind of hate regardless? Have you ever gotten an upgrade or made a lateral move toward a different piece of equipment and realized things had been way, way more difficult than they needed to be?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@norevisions?ref=remapradio.com"><span>No Revisions</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Ah, this is funny. Some of my earliest movement towards “smart” devices when we bought our house eight years ago was entirely driven by me running into an issue with the house that I could not solve through regular memory, habit, and phone/watch reminders. This is a low stakes issue, but I could not, for the life of me, remember to turn off the outdoor lights that sit encased above our front door. I also could not, for the life of me, remember to turn them on at night. When I did one, I would forget the other, leading to situations where the light was either left on all day or never flipped on when the sun went down.</p><p>Frustrated, I finally investigated these so-called “Phillips Hue” light bulbs my friends online kept chattering on about. The lights required for my light fixture were candelabras—<em>smart</em> candelabras. And naturally, they were more expensive. But the idea of having the lights go on, then off, then on again, then off again without ever having to think about on/off again was tremendously appealing. Being able to alter their habits when we were out of town was appealing, too. I looked up how well such lights hold up under cold weather and was told by reddit to “not worry about it.” Eight years later, they’re doing fine, and my brain has never, ever had to think about whether those lights have been in the right position for near a decade.</p><p>It’s the small things, no?&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We're living in a golden age of new Dragon Ball games, and if you're looking to score a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> discount on a recent release, you're in luck, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBRK93?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is just $50</a> currently. Normally priced at $70, Sparking Zero is the newest chapter in the venerable Tenkaichi Budokai series, a line of Dragon Ball games that has been dormant for quite a few years.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBRK93?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero (PS5)</a> -- $50 ($<del>70</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPTBQGRQ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero (Xbox Series X)</a> -- $50 ($<del>70</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The long wait between releases has paid off, as Sparking Zero is a fast and furious brawler that looks amazing in action. For Dragon Ball fans, it's a game with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-every-confirmed-character/2900-5470/" data-ref-id="2900-5470">absurdly massive roster</a> that allows for dream fights to unfold between iconic characters like Goku and Vegeta, new faces like Jiren, and even obscure fighters who've only been seen in a handful of episodes. If you can overlook the repetitive side of the combat and you're looking for a fighting game that has deep gameplay mechanics to master, there's a lot to appreciate here.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the most part, the Tenkaichi approach still works thanks to its fast and energized battle system; however, repetitive gameplay and limited mode options leave us wanting more from this battle," Jason Fanelli wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review/1900-6418295/" data-ref-id="1900-6418295">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero review</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can also check out Tekken 8 for another solid fighting game option.

Like previous Tekken games, it's a hard-hitting affair featuring a stacked cast of characters, each one wielding a unique martial arts style that you can master in 3D arenas. If you'd like to stick to Dragon Ball specifically, the last couple of games released all offer neat experiences.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BANDAI-NAMCO-Entertainment-1209334-Dragon/dp/B0BHT4JJ1N?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a> has a deeper RPG gameplay design that covers Goku's journey through the Dragon Ball Z storylines, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0BQ4QG4QY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> is a superb 2.5D fighting game by Guilty Gear studio Arc System Works, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DRAGON-BALL-XENOVERSE-2-Xbox-X/dp/B0CWVR3QM9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball XenoVerse 2</a> allows you to create your own legendary fighter who'll help protect timelines from shenanigans.

                <p>There have been some unique throwback games over the years, but SpreadCheat looks like it's going to be in a category all of its own. Games People Play and Rubarb are developing the upcoming puzzle title, which invites the player to use an Excel-like program to commit a little financial fraud in the name of hitting your company's fiscal targets.</p><p>Although Games People Play describes SpreadCheat as capturing "a retro Windows 3.11 setting," the actual character models and backgrounds look like mid-'80s computer graphics. The player's character is a recently hired employee who has to cook the books, so to speak. Essentially, players have to create and manipulate spreadsheet data so it looks like the company is hitting its financial goals. In the real world, this would all be wildly illegal. But in the context of the game, it's played for laughs. One thing we're not clear about is whether the player can be caught and punished for their financial malfeasance by the authorities.</p>

<p>The pseudo-Excel program used in the game features its own version of Microsoft's Clippy, the annoying virtual Office assistant that would pop up whenever users would forget to turn it off. Perhaps the fake Clippy in this game will actually be useful, which would be a nice change.</p><p>Games People Play has released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3019170/SpreadCheat_Demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the demo for SpreadCheat on Steam</a>, and the title can also be put on your wishlist. The game is expected to be released on PC in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
