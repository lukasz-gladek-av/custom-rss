The console didn’t end up launching, but at CES 2025, My Arcade is reviving it with an expected release later this year.</p><p>The design and functionality of the Super Retro Champ appears nearly identical to what My Arcade revealed in 2020, but as with many things now, it’s expected to be slightly more expensive. Instead of $110, the handheld is now priced at $149.99.</p><div><figcaption><em>Super Nintendo cartridges end up slightly sticking out of the top of the handheld, while Sega Genesis carts sit flush in its bottom slot.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: My Arcade</cite></p></div><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">Analogue Pocket</a>, which can play retro titles using cartridges or ROM files, the Super Retro Champ is similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">ModRetro Chromatic</a> and sticks to carts. It’s got a slot on the top for SNES games (that end up slightly sticking out) and a second on the bottom for Genesis carts. It’s also compatible with cartridges released for the international versions of those classic consoles, including Super Famicom and Mega Drive games.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s unlikely you’re ever going to find a pocket large enough to carry the Super Retro Champ.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: My Arcade</cite></p></div><p>With a six-inch screen surrounded by generous bezels plus a directional pad and action buttons on either side, the Super Retro Champ doesn’t prioritize portability. You can use it as a handheld with “hours of uninterrupted gameplay” from its rechargeable battery, My Arcade says, but it’s better suited for playing while propped up on a table using its folding stand, a pair of connected controllers, and a power adapter.</p><p>If six inches feels too cramped for you and another player, there’s also an HDMI port on the back of the Super Retro Champ for connecting it to a TV. Just don’t expect to enjoy your favorite 16-bit titles in HD or expect them to look as good as they did on the old CRT TV you grew up with.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And one of those maps includes what some fans are hoping is a tease for an upcoming hero: the sound-manipulating mutant Dazzler.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On the Midtown map, you can find a poster promoting Dazzler’s “Light the World” tour. The mutant daylights as a pop star, and it looks like she’s going on tour during the events of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. As Hoshi points out in the TikTok below, the poster also has Dazzler’s signature, which every hero has on their character’s lore page in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ menus.</p><figure id="" data-id="629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-recommend-id="image://629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1032" data-height="580" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-recommend-id="image://629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1032" data-height="580" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The poster isn’t the only reference to Dazzler in the game right now. In a pre-match exchange over music, Star-Lord suggestively asks Luna Snow if she knows the pop star. Like Dazzler, Luna Snow is also a hero juggling a music career, so it would make sense if they’d crossed paths at some point. While these are only easter eggs for comic fans at the moment, some players are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/snoozeclock/status/1877064523774898446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/snoozeclock/status/1877064523774898446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hopeful</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OmniGulano/status/1877067026390221142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OmniGulano/status/1877067026390221142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this means </a></span><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Teatitty/status/1877054180633858514&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Teatitty/status/1877054180633858514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dazzler </a></span>could be bringing her sound-wielding powers to the hero shooter in the future. Come on, a music-based Luna Snow and Dazzler Team-Up ability is an easy pull. I went looking and it turns out fans have been making mock-ups of Dazzler’s hypothetical <em>Marvel Rivals</em> design for a bit.</p><p>Right now there are already a handful of X-Men in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it could certainly do with more. I can already envision Dazzler using her abilities to turn sound into light to produce a flashbang to temporarily blind enemies. However, NetEase is introducing Invisible Woman this season, whose kit also plays with visibility, albeit in a defensive manner rather than an offensive one. Should Dazzler make her way to the roster, it will likely not be any time soon as Season 1 is already bringing four heroes to the mix, with the Human Torch and the Thing set to follow Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman in the second half.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The upcoming open-world action RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is releasing on PC after all. </p>



<p>After first being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-mobile-game-is-launching-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed for iOS and Android</a> at The Game Awards 2024, developer Netmarble has confirmed the game will launch on Windows. The confirmation came via an announcement for <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta signups</a> that added PC to the available platforms. </p>



<p>Alongside the beta announcement came a list of minimum PC specs that players need. those include an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 8GB of memory, 30GB of storage space, Windows 10/11, and at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT graphics card.</p>



<p>Regarding the Game of Thrones: Kingsroad closed beta, it will take place from January 16-22 and be on both PC and mobile. It will feature the first look at the land of Westeros, three classes to try,  and a look at the original story developed specifically for the game. Those who take part in the beta will receive exclusive rewards after the game’s full launch later this year.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the game features a new original story that starts with the dead of King Robert Baratheon.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is almost here. Scheduled for release in less than two months, the game’s promotional campaign is in full swing.</p>



<p>Aware of the huge hype for the game, IGN brought the title to its <a href="https://youtu.be/yp-28fhhOs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First</a> panel. The show is dedicated to revealing new information about highly anticipated games. In the videos released today, they provided details of two monsters: Ajakaran and Rompopolo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the videos, the two monsters reside in the Oilwell Basin area. A volcanic ecosystem full of caves, tar pits, oil lakes and large thermal vents that spew out smoke and other gases. The region is home to the Azuz Tribe. They use the region’s characteristics to produce energy and weapons. The region’s Apex monster is called the Black Flame, however, no further details about the monster have been revealed yet.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Rompopolo Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yp-28fhhOs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As we can see in the videos above, the Ajarakan resembles a Flaming Gorilla with a carapace and the Rompopolo resembles a mosquito fused with a mantis. Both monsters are new to Wilds. According to the game’s Wiki, they are very territorial and often fight each other.</p>



<p>The Rompopolo usually buries its tail in mud and oil to cause gas explosions, while the Ajarakan is strong and agile, using its aggression to unleash flaming attacks.</p>



<p>Scheduled for release on February 28th, the next game in the franchise is one of the most anticipated games of 2025. It will come as no surprise if it ends up being nominated for the best game of the year. Judging by all the materials released so far, the game looks spectacular. Of course, we’ll have to see it in action next month!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Xbox has announced a new Developer_Direct stream will take place on Thursday 23rd January at 6PM GMT, giving an inside look at some of the biggest games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> in 2025</p>
<p>The Developer_Direct will focus on four games from across Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and one third party title that Microsoft has cosied up to. Three of these games are known with one additional secret…</p>


<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them, visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and to id Studios for a look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Lastly, they’ll visit a surprise studio to see a brand new game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is obviously the headline act, a prequel tale to the acclaimed 2016 Doom and Doom Eternal, which sees us head back in time to see where the Doom Slayer came from, waging a more medieval war on Hell.</p>
<p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, comes from the makers of We Happy Few, but is a very different style of game, a third person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South. Playing as Hazel, you’ll dive into a flooded world that takes deep inspiration from folklore to unravel a hidden past.</p>

<p>A Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a gorgeous looking turn-based RPG from French studio Sandfall interactive, seeing you lead a team on a last-ditch effort to foil the Paintress and stop her from wiping out yet another age group, turning them into dust. Who does she think she is? Thanos?</p>
<p>Microsoft has made a tradition out of hosting a developer showcase in January to start off the year, looking at games for the year ahead. January 2024 saw them reveal <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> gameplay, give a deep dive into the gameplay of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a> (which was eventually postponed to February 2025), and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</a>.</p>

			<p>A new trailer today has been published, showcasing the world of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. The game will be arriving on Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2025. For those who are fans of the Xenoblade Universe, this is a massive opportunity and upgrade for the title, as it was previously released in 2015 on the Wii U. Now, the sci-fi RPG will be coming to the Nintendo Switch with new story elements to dive into, new characters to love (or hate), new Skell and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-comparison/">enhanced visuals</a>. Below is the brand-new trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – The year is 2054… (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2nQgIm3PJFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game takes place in the year 2054, when the Earth has been destroyed by a war between two alien races, and it means that humanity is close to becoming extinct. A number of survivors crash land on the planet Mira, and it becomes your job to restore humanity and give them a fighting chance again.</p>
<p>As you explore Mira and get to see all of the different environments, you'll also get your own Skell, which is a powerful exoskeleton that can fly, transform into a vehicle, and give you great strength in battle.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in getting some extra rewards in-game, if you purchase it from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Edition-2687393.html?srsltid=AfmBOopnSpGk-TEHqfO276zxlrVcV74REdoa84-OEc69XTCQzTLdBw8n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo eShop</a> before April 6, 2025, or redeem the download code included in the physical version, then you will be given the Exploration Support Pack.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-wallace-gromit-dlc-takes-you-to-west-wallaby-street.1078089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-wallace-gromit-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and FuturLab have revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC, and this time around, it's beloved Aardman animation&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>'s time to shine.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, the<em>&nbsp;PowerWash Simulator Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>DLC will take you to the iconic 62 West Wallaby Street to clean some of the absent-minded inventor's most prized possessions, as well as the likes of Gromit's kennel and more.</p>

<p>The DLC's new Steam page promises to take you "from charming British suburbs to cheesy celestial bodies", so it sounds like you'll be able to visit the moon from the duo's inaugural adventure&nbsp;<em>A Grand Day Out</em>. Cracking!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wallace-gromit-dlc-powerwash-simulator-house.jpg?itok=Q-sh4sMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wallace-gromit-dlc-powerwash-simulator-house.jpg?itok=7A4JOkqs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>is getting&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>-themed DLC soon.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know how many locations will be featured in the DLC, but as with other&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC packs, there will presumably be a number of different levels on offer.</p>

<p>It might stand a chance of being the strangest, but this <i>PowerWash Simulator Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</i>DLC is far from the game's first crossover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It joins the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Shrek</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, and, of course,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>, all of which have offered up their various vestiges and objects for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>&nbsp;to hose down.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet have a release date for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>pack, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3077590/PowerWash_Simulator__Wallace__Gromit_Special_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to keep up with it.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, well, I'm sure you can guess what it is, but in case you need a refresher, it's a work sim-style game in which you must hose down various unclean locations and objects.</p>

<p>Playing either by yourself or alongside your friends, you can clean dirt from interiors and exteriors alike, taking satisfaction in a job well done. It's very much a relaxing, combat-free experience, unless you count the battle of water versus dirt as combat.</p>

<p><em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/powerwash-simulator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/powerwash-simulator/9NHDJC0NW20M" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

The gameplay is that of a third-person shooter in a semi-open world. The most eye-catching part of the footage is that Bumblebee can transform between a robot and a car on the fly in what seems like a pretty seamless and satisfying animation to control. Traversal looks like it might have been a big part of <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, and it probably had the potential to play off of the core ability at the heart of the Hasbro toy franchise in interesting ways. </p><p>An executive for the company had previously said the game was shaping up well. <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> would be a “milestone for<em> Transformers</em> in the next year or two” that “nailed the feeling of playing as a massive, bipedal robot,” senior VP of digital strategy and licensing for Hasbro, Eugene Evans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span> in early 2024. </p><p>Who knows whether the rest of the game around that core gameplay premise would have been fun or worthwhile. Making all of the disparate bits of game work together in a satisfying and worthwhile way is one of the biggest design and technical challenges of making any game, and maybe <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> was ultimately canceled because it just wasn’t coming together, at least in a timeframe Hasbro was willing to foot the bill for. </p><p>“This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people,” Splash Damage <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in its statement this week</a></span>. “We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on <em>Transformers </em>for their dedication and passion. Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to showing off the game’s sprawling alien planet geography and setting up the stakes for its sci-fi story, the trailer also gives longtime fans a glimpse of new content, including a section of<em> Chrono Trigger</em>-esque floating islands teased at the very end which weren’t part of the original game. </p><p>But the most important addition to the 2015 game is probably the reworking its UI seems to have gotten. The on-screen HUDs for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles </em>games are notoriously busy and tiny, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was perhaps the series’ worst offender of all with tiny character portraits and stat bars on the left side of the screen while ability cooldowns were wedged in along the bottom. </p><p>In the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, the fonts are bigger, things are more spread out, and there’s more information on the screen explaining what bonuses players will get from what abilities, as well as a combo guide for the game’s all-important but very obtuse Overdrive system. It’s still busy but a lot easier to parse, and will hopefully be part of an overall attempt to make <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>’s myriad systems easier to navigate for new players. </p><p>The trailer also ends with a look at a hooded figure on a beach, suggesting new story content is coming that might continue the decade-old Wii U game’s story. Fans are already speculating that it might be on the level of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>'s <em>Future Redeemed</em> expansion, which helped tie that game into the other entries in the franchise. At the very least it looks like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> will be a complete package worthy of the Switch’s final year as Nintendo’s main console. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the most blatant Pokémon rip-offs is now available to be wishlisted on Steam. Insider Gaming was recently contacted by the developers behind “Fay Keeper,” a brand-new creature-catching game where players collect and battle hundreds of creatures called “Fays.” The request was for a paid partnership – and in the current game industry climate it’s an opportunity that comes few and far between.</p>



<p>Yet, having looked at the game initially, we couldn’t help but feel inclined that the game is a blatant rip-off of Pokémon.</p>



<p>From the color pallet to the creatures themselves, the comparisons are strikingly similar, and although it’s clear that the developers want to capitalize on an itching Pokémon audience on the PC, I can’t help but feel the team is likely going to run into legal issues. You even get your very own “Faydex.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming compiled a couple comparisons between Fay Keeper and Pokémon below (click to enlarge) so you can muster your own opinions.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, the developers of the game have addressed them slightly on social media when asked by fans about the comparisons to Pokémon. BGS Studios doesn’t hide the fact that it takes inspiration from the classic franchise, but maintains that there will be enough differences between the titles to avoid any potential legal claims.</p>



<p>“Pokémon was a huge ref and the idea was for it to feel nostalgic, but me and the team are working on a lot of unique features that Pokémon games never had,” <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861816033549443480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one post reads</a>.</p>



<p>In another response to a question regarding copyright, <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861906032097718607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BGS Studios said</a>, “Although we took inspiration from a very nostalgic reference, every single pixel and line of code is being made from scratch by us. We’ll also have mechanics that were never in the original ref, so it will hit close while also being a different thing.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming did reach out to BGS Studios for further comment on the similarities, and to talk about any potential worries or concerns. Those attempts, however, have gone unanswered as of publishing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/v-rising-sales-top-5-million-as-stunlock-promises-major-new-update.1078053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has reached another major new sales milestone, according to developer Stunlock, and there's a big new update in the works for the game as well.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has officially crossed the 5 million sales milestone, which the developer says "cements the game's status as one of the most popular survival games of recent years". It's hard to disagree with that, especially in conjunction with that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive Steam rating</a>.</p>

<p>These sales numbers mean that&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 2 million sales or so for itself since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-cross-3-million-threshold" rel="nofollow">hitting the 3 million mark back in January 2023</a>. Given that the game's 1.0 release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">landed in May last year</a>&nbsp;and that it hit PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-ps5-release-date" rel="nofollow">the following month</a>, that's perhaps to be expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-sales-5m-castle.jpg?itok=jsVheeQi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-sales-5m-castle.jpg?itok=lqebCDjG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales threshold (presumably after being asked to do so).</figcaption></figure><p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>, then perhaps the "big update" that's on its way to the game this year will convince you it's worth your time.</p>

<p>Stunlock says the update will bring a brand new biome that's "teeming with uncharted territories, a deadly new faction, and ancient technologies ready to be claimed".</p>

<p>In addition, you can look orward to revamped progression, a new Fusion Forge to help you craft "ultimate builds", and "risk-free PvP options" like the ability to duel other players, "customizable castle arenas", and more. All of this is on the way for free, too.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>, it's a sandbox survival game in which you play as a vampire lord attempting to build your very own vampiric empire in a hostile world.</p>

<p>You can construct your own castle, venture out into the world to find resources and battle enemies, and even team up with (or do battle with) other players.</p>

<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. There's no word yet on whether it's coming to other platforms.</p>

For instance, if you’re in bed next to your significant other and don’t want to wake them, you should be able to pop in some earbuds and keep all your noisy gaming to yourself, right?</p><p>Well, with the PlayStation Portal, you may find yourself a bit disappointed when it comes to headphone selections. Let’s dive into your options.</p><h2 id="h4201"><a id=""></a>Which headphones are compatible with PlayStation Portal?</h2><p>So, first of all, the PlayStation Portal comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, which means <strong>you can plug in any standard headphones and use them just fine</strong>. If you’ve got an old pair of wired earbuds in a drawer somewhere and don’t mind being tethered to the device with a wire, you’re golden.</p><p>However, things get more complicated if you want to use wireless headphones because, unfortunately, Sony has designed the PlayStation Portal to work exclusively with wireless audio devices that use its proprietary PlayStation Link connection. This means that any wireless headphones you already own likely won’t work with the PlayStation Portal.</p><p>So, which wireless devices <em>do</em> work? Well, you only have two options at this time.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PULSE Elite headset</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PULSE Explore earbuds</a></span></li></ul><p>Yeah, it’s kind of a bummer. Over time, there are sure to be additional headphones that use this technology, but it still kind of sucks to have to purchase an all-new audio device alongside a handheld system just to get such basic functionality.</p><p>Despite this frustrating decision by Sony, the PlayStation Portal remains one of the best ways to play your PlayStation games when you’re not near a console. And if handheld gaming is an important part of your life, it may be worth splurging to make the most of the experience. Or, you know, just dig out those wax-filled wired earbuds you bought back in 2009 and make do. </p><p>.<br>  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A full release will follow for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-937608"></span></p><p>Get the latest information below.</p><blockquote><p>Hack-and-slash fans will be able to discover an ancient world dominated by dragons and battle hordes of enemies. In the run-up to its Early Access release, Jonathan Gabrielli, lead game designer at Eko Software, will be taking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyZvo4H1rtY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nacon YouTube channel</a> on January 10 to give players a detailed look at the new features that they will be adding to this well-known genre.</p><p>Eko Software is a small team of enthusiasts behind the How to Survive series of games and <em>Warhammer Chaosbane</em>, released in 2019. As Hack’Nslash fans, some of them for several decades, they want to create an experience that is both a tribute to the references of the genre and an original and ambitious proposition, aimed at hardcore fans.</p><p>In this original adventure, which can be played alone or in cooperative play with up to four players (cooperative play will be implemented in the final version of the game), players choose one of the four available heroes (three heroes will be playable at the start of early access) with their own abilities and combat techniques, and set off to explore several environments, each with its own monsters, resources and challenges. Gradually, they develop their character through a skill grid called the Ancestral Grid. This is a truly unique mechanic that requires players to build their own skill tree by strategically placing Fragments obtained during gameplay, juxtaposed with multiple modifiers. Each hero has their own grid that offers endless combinations to create a truly unique character and combat style.</p><p>Another major element of the game is The City.

                <p dir="ltr">Another day, another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> detail has apparently leaked out. Accessory listings have allegedly appeared in GameStop's internal computer system for employees. While the usual suspects are showing up for the hybrid system--a carrying case and Joy-Con charging stand, for instance--the microSD options are of particular interest. That's because Nintendo's next system seemingly will support express card functionality for expanded storage.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/?rdt=63367" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> revealed the alleged GameStop listings for Switch 2, with microSD express card options for 256GB and 512GB popping up. No brand is noted, though <a href="https://shop.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd-cards/sandisk-microsd-express-memory-card?sku=SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SanDisk</a> sells 128GB and 256GB versions (intriguingly not the 512GB option, however). Additionally, SanDisk says its microSD express cards offer read speeds that are 4.4 times quicker than the next fastest option. For video games specifically, this allows players to "start gaming faster and explore virtual worlds that appear more realistic than ever," according to the company. The current Switch doesn't support these cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">accessory company Genki claimed that Switch 2 will launch in April</a> while showing off a supposed replica of Switch 2 at CES in Las Vegas. This comes on top of unconfirmed pictures from an alleged Chinese factory of a person holding a left Joy-Con for Switch 2. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-images-apparently-emerge-could-tease-unexpected-feature/1100-6528637/" data-ref-id="1100-6528637">The images have people speculating that the new controllers feature optical sensors</a>, meaning they could have mouse-like functionality.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo still hasn't unveiled anything official for the Switch successor, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">a full reveal should take place before the end of March</a>. Last month, a report stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-indeed-called-switch-2-report/1100-6528573/" data-ref-id="1100-6528573">the system will indeed be called Switch 2</a>.</p>

                <p>Video game voice actors in the SAG-AFTRA union have been on strike since July 2024, and one of the chief issues concerns the use of artificial intelligence. Jennifer Hale, who is among the most famous voice actors out there, has commented on the ongoing negotiations and why it's taking so long to resolve. She told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, "AI is an existential issue for all of us." Hale is best known for voicing Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, along with roles in Baldur's Gate, Metal Gear Solid, Halo, and Overwatch, among many others.</p><p>She said the "repercussions are vast" when it comes to AI, and this helps explain why the union and the video game publishers are taking their time to make a deal.</p><p>"I've been speaking to people on both sides over the last few months especially and there's a lot to learn on both sides," Hale said. "Some of the decision makers in that room who hold significant power are at the same time quite disconnected from how production happens. There are also many in that room who are deeply connected to the process. So there is such a wide variety of agendas at play."</p><p>She went on to say that some people at the negotiating table are receptive to having "productive conversations" about making a deal, while others, whom Hale said represent "large-scale corporate interest," are not willing yet to make a deal out of a concern for "profit protection in the future."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1039247714"

Hale was involved in those discussions, too, and she said a key difference between the strike of 2016 and 2024/2025 is that the two sides had productive side bars without attorneys involved.</p><p>"My understanding is that in this particular negotiation up until very, very recently, they haven't been allowed to talk to each other. They can each talk to their attorney, and then the attorneys talk to each other. And until you have the people with the vested interest having the conversations, all that's happening is billable hours are going up," she said, referring to attorney fees.</p><p>Overall, Hale described the two strike periods as being "vastly different," in part because the world is "much more polarized," with people living in "crazy echo chambers."</p><p>"A great negotiation ends up with everybody being a little unhappy. I think it's really important that we all remember, that is the definition of compromise. We're not in there to get our way. We're in there to protect our future," she said.</p><p>Back in August 2024, just after the strike began, Hale also spoke about why the fight against AI is so imperative.</p><p>"AI is coming for all of us," <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jennifer-hale-video-game-strike-sag-aftra-1236125843/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hale told Variety.</a> "Because the truth is, AI is just a tool like a hammer. If I take my hammer, I could build you a house. I can also take that same hammer and I can smash your skin and destroy who you are."</p><p>Beyond voice acting, many are concerned that the rise in artificial intelligence technologies could negatively impact jobs done by humans. Recently, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">admitted that AI will lead to job losses.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-developer-direct-to-show-off-doom-the-dark-ages-and-more-on-january-23rd.1078020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Xbox Developer Direct presentation has been announced for later this month, and it will feature updates on upcoming Xbox games, including&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news site, the presentation will air on January 23rd. Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-release-date-revealed-during-xbox-developer-direct" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Developer Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-2024-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">showcases</a>, it'll offer "an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they're being created, and who's creating them".</p>

<p>The show will begin with a new look at Compulsion Games' action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and it'll continue with a trip to France to check in with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>developer Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=N3pntcyK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=c097vuwL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>is just one of the games that will be featured at this month's Xbox Developer Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>Following those two games, the presentation will switch focus to&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which is being developed by id Software over in Texas.</p>

<p>Perhaps most tantalizingly, though, Xbox says the showcase will end with a visit to a "surprise location" in order to see "another studio's brand new game". I wonder who that could be?</p>

<p>As ever with Developer Direct showcases, you probably shouldn't expect any extra reveals beyond what's been promised by Microsoft; outside of the "brand new game" that's being teased, it's likely the show will focus on the aforementioned three games.</p>

<p>As for what will be revealed regarding the three games outlined above, I'd be surprised if we didn't get a release date for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>at the very least, since the game is currently penciled in for a 2025 launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=lg1cyQ6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=9rBDTFXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get a&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>release date during this month's Xbox Developer Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is promising a "full game reveal" for&nbsp;<em>The Dark Ages</em>, as well as a "deep dive" into&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>and a behind-the-scenes look at&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em>. Developer Direct shows are traditionally more focused on dev processes than sizzle reels, so expect some interesting insider tidbits.</p>

<p>At any rate, the next Xbox Developer Direct will air on January 23rd at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific). Stay tuned for more.</p>
