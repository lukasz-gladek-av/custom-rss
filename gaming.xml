<p>In March of this year, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app received an update adding songs from the Switch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo mentioned how the rest of this album was coming "later this year", and now, ahead of the launch of the Switch 2 Edition of this title, additional tracks have been added to this album.</p>

        <p>Humanity is approaching its end.</p><p>In a world steeped in despair and chaos, a strange religious organization called Shuten Order emerges, yearning for the end of humanity. The group rapidly gains followers, eventually forming a small nation state called Shuten.</p><p>Tragedy strikes during the grand festival celebrating their nation’s founding—the leader of the Shuten Order is murdered. Soon after, the protagonist awakens with no memory, greeted by two self-proclaimed “angels”. They reveal a shocking truth: the protagonist is the murdered Founder, revived by divine power. However, the resurrection is incomplete—their memories are gone, and their life limited to a mere four days.</p><p>To survive, the protagonist must overcome “God’s trial”: identify and kill their murderer.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the protagonist, given the alias Rei, dives into the tumultuous city as a detective. The suspects? Five ministers of the Shuten Order. There’s no time to investigate them all. Choices must be made, and the pursuit of truth demands sacrifice.</p><p>Who killed the Founder?

<p>Ahead of Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2025 in September, PlayStation has announced its lineup for the expo. The convention, held yearly, has already shown promise this year with contributors like Capcom and Koei Tecmo showing up with huge games. Now, PlayStation has joined in on the fun with two of its biggest upcoming titles.</p>



<p>This is the company’s second year in a row showing up to TGS after being absent from 2020-2023.  Last year, the biggest games were Monster Hunter Wilds and the GOTY winner Astro Bot. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach also held a showcase, where a new trailer was unveiled. While no showcases are revealed just yet, the two titles on display are sure to make fans happy.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As of right now, only two brand-new titles will be available for attendees to play on the show floor. Those titles, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/sony-interactive-entertainment-announces-preliminary-tgs-2025-lineup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>, are Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei and ARC System Works’ Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls. More games will be announced closer to the expo’s start on September 25th, 2025. </p>



<p>This marks the first public demo of Ghost of Yotei, which launches a week after TGS on October 2nd. Meanwhile, many fans at EVO got their hands on Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls, with many more when the closed beta comes on September 6th. Still, both games are some of the studio’s and are sure to make a splash with attendees.</p>

<p>Following an announcement earlier this month, Nintendo's free Switch eShop and smart device application <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> is now available to download.</p>
<p>This game is designed for parents and their children and is only available in Japan right now. If you want to download the game on your Switch or Switch 2, you'll need to have access to a Japanese Nintendo account.</p>
<p>When you boot up the application, the message "play together with an adult!" appears on the screen and from there, Mario's face will pop up and you can interact with it. You can also use the block in the corner of the screen to access items and other interactive objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zugqwj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's an official description, along with some more screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the eShop page, Hello, Mario! is only playable in handheld mode and requires 156 MB on Switch and 166 MB on Switch 2 to install.</p>
<p>This app is part of a new range of Super Mario products aimed at parents and children. These products are scheduled to be released outside of Japan at the beginning of <strong>2026</strong>. You can find out more in our previous story here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam TPS Fest</a>, the multiplayer 5v5 shooter Last Flag released a surprise demo today. The fest, which celebrates Third-Person games with sales and demos, started today. While many demos were already available, like Star Wars Outlaws, Last Flag is one title nobody expected to see. </p>



<p>Last Flag, scheduled for 2026 for Steam (with console versions in the works), is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter by Night Street Games based on the infamous Capture the Flag mode. With a unique 70s art style and fun gameplay, it definitely stands out from other titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Therefore, the surprise release of a limited-time demo is sure to get some attention, especially after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s success</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-flag-s-free-demo-lasts-from-august-25th-to-september-1st">Last Flag’s Free Demo Lasts from August 25th to September 1st</h2>







<p>As per a press release, a free demo for Last Flag is available now on Steam for players to try. The demo will only be up for a week, ending September 1st. To get the demo, head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> and download the demo. </p>



<p>With multiple characters to choose from, with a wide range of abilities, you’ll work together with your team to hide the flag and capture it. In addition, music for the game has been worked on by Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons), Grammy-nominated producer/writer JT Daly (Benson Boone), and Dave Lowmiller (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare). It seems like the perfect mix for players to create an unforgettable experience on and off the battleground.</p>



<p>Do you plan on playing Last Flag this week? If you have, how are you liking it? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The perils of backing a crowdfunded game <a href="https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/160421/controversial-or-fraudulent-kickstarters?itemid=7809913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are nothing new</a>; a successfully-financed campaign failing to deliver is hardly an outlier, and is often down to the team behind it being inexperienced. In the case of the RPG <em>Grimwild</em>, however, the lack of a delivered project is for potentially more serious reasons.</p><p>The tabletop RPG, which<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was originally supported in 2024 on crowdfunding site BackerKit by 590 people for $40,000</a> (before<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild-hardcover-reprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a later hardcover version was backed by 597 for a further $47,000</a>), promised a "cinematic narrative rules system" which eschewed the finer points of rules in favour of a game that was more "concerned with the dramatic over the realistic". After a few updates to the rules and some production delays, both physical editions of the rulebook<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild/updates/21610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> were supposed to be delivered to customers in July</a>.</p><p>That window has obviously come and gone, with no books delivered. In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1meaho5/grimwild_designer_missing/?share_id=rCU9CP0TaWK4YjRZMMkjd&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> delivered to backers on the game's community Discord server last month, a moderator explained why, revealing that nobody involved with the book's production had been able to get in touch with Grimwild's designer, J.D. Maxwell, for weeks.</p><p>"As many of you have noticed, Max has been absent for nearly two months", the statement says. "Initially, we weren’t too worried. We knew he needed a break. Launching a successful crowdfunding campaign and a project like this is as rewarding as it is exhausting, and Max had also been going through some real-life changes that we hoped he was taking time to adjust to and enjoy."</p><p>Maxwell's colleagues on the game's design and production, Per Janke and Luke Saunders, have been "doing everything they can to reach Max or at least someone who can confirm he’s okay", and acknowledge that they "understand how confusing, frustrating, and even worrying this situation is".</p><p>A crowdfunded game designer cutting off all contact after getting their money would normally be cause for concern among the backer community, sparking fears the game would never be completed. In this case, however, things are different; not only is the game finished and the manufacturing costs reportedly already paid for--fans have been able to play a downloadable edition of <em>Grimwild </em>for months now, it's only the physical book deliveries that are being held up--<a href="https://ennie-awards.com/2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but just a few weeks ago both Maxwell and <em>Grimwild</em>'s free pdf version were nominated for, and won, an award at the Ennies</a>.</p><p>Yet physical deliveries have been unable to proceed because the manufacturing accounts are in Maxwell's name, while Janke and Saunders (who are just freelancers on the project, not employees of Maxwell's company) have run into the same issue with the game's Backerkit page, so they're unable to publish updates there either. Meanwhile the website for Oddity Press, Maxwell's publishing entity responsible for the game, is now down and showing a "website expired" error.</p><p>"None of us were involved in the actual process of the crowdfunding or order of the printing", Janke tells Aftermath. "So we’re trying to make any effort to figure out the situation around J.D. Maxwell and the current state of the crowdfunding campaign. I got in contact with the printer and as far as we know the order for the <em>Grimwild</em> print did go through to them. But without a final go from J.D. as the only legal entity from Oddity Press, the printing process can’t be started, unfortunately."</p><p>As a result, the remaining team say in their update that until Maxwell can be located, "Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely". "Until a few months ago it looked like everything was on track for the expected delivery of July this year", Saunders tells Aftermath, "but Max has been gone for a while now and there’s nothing we can do on our side to help with fulfilment I’m afraid."</p><p>A couple of days after I spoke with Janke and Saunders, the latter posted an update on the game's Discord saying they had "submitted a detailed report to the BackerKit Trust &amp; Safety Team regarding the current situation", and that the team's hope is that "BackerKit will be able to move things forward as they have much greater legal capacity and resources than we do."</p><p>The <em>Grimwild</em> community are asking anyone who may know how to get in contact with Maxwell to reach out to the game's Discord mods privately.</p><p><em>[Thanks James G]</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp"><h3>Overwatch 2 Developers Say They’re Leaning Into What Works</h3></a><p>'We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past.'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing]]></content:encoded>

As a result, fans might be hoping for an eventual third game in the series.

When asked by the interviewer about Death Stranding 3, he replied with the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2. But I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data.

<section><p>"We have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets," Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller told GameSpot in an exclusive interview.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Without being hyperbolic--and as someone who has been an on-and-off again Overwatch fan since the original game's release back in 2016--I don't mean it lightly when I say that I believe Overwatch has never been better.</p><p dir="ltr">I've critiqued the series quite a bit throughout the years. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/overwatch-2-review-same-as-it-ever-was/1900-6417972/">Overwatch 2 review</a>, I wrote at length about how it felt "detached from the principles and charm of the original," was seemingly struggling to retain its identity, and how its new monetization models felt disingenuous and "at odds with the spirit of the original Overwatch." Harsh words, yes, but I meant them. I was frustrated by what one of my all-time favorite games had become, and worried that I'd be chasing the same bliss I felt playing in 2017 endlessly and to no avail.</p><p dir="ltr">So, with all that said, how did we get here?</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to discuss the state of Overwatch 2 with game director Aaron Keller and associate game director Alec Dawson in an exclusive interview for GameSpot, and it seems a lot of this dramatic turn-around boils down to two things: an increased emphasis on responding to player feedback, and a sharp pivot away from the "conservative" mentality the Overwatch 2 team once clung to. The result is a vastly improved game that is taking big swings with more efficiency.</p><p dir="ltr">Be it Stadium mode, Perks, the inclusion of heroes with never-before-tried mechanics, map voting, hero bans, or one of the many other tweaks and additions made to the game, Blizzard is not shying away from shaking up Overwatch 2's core gameplay loop; Season 18 is no exception. And according to Keller and Dawson, all these changes are just the beginning of the studio's push to "explore how big" Overwatch can become.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: A lot of changes have happened this year in Overwatch 2, so I would love to start by unpacking that with you both. How do you think things are going? How are you feeling about the overall health of the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>When you look at the way that 2025 has gone for the game, we've done a lot of big releases. Earlier this year, we released our Perk system, which was a pretty substantial game mechanic that changed the way moment-to-moment gameplay can happen. It gave players more strategic choices that they could make over the course of a match and put more emphasis on what a hero can do and [fulfilling] that power fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 16, we released Stadium. It's probably the biggest new game mode we've ever introduced to the game and there was a lot of player excitement there. We've done a lot of other things, too. We introduced hero bans this year. We introduced map voting this year. We've introduced a new hero as well, with another one soon to come.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of players are now telling us that this is the best state that Overwatch has ever been in and we think that some of that is because we're making bigger changes to the game than we typically would have in the past. If you look back on the history of Overwatch, you could say that maybe we're a little bit conservative, but we have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets with Overwatch, and I think you'll see that when we get to Season 18.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's great to hear. Touching on that, I would love to hear a little bit more about what's coming tomorrow in Season 18.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>We look at Season 18 as sort of the next steps for a number of the big swings we've taken this year. There's around 60 new Perks that are brand new--every hero gets [a refresh]. Quick play is coming to Stadium, and then you have four new heroes coming: Brigitte, Winston, Farah, and then Tracer.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of what we're doing in [Season] 18 [stems from] evaluating what's in the game currently and evolving it in some way and/or even revamping it. Our progression system is a great example. It's been one of those things that's been in the game for a bit now, but there's a lot of screen space that players weren't really caring about; a lot of bars going up, a lot of things you're leveling up. We want to simplify it--make sure it's a lot more visible, make sure it's a lot more surfaced.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>We are doing a total revamp to our progression system. When you looked at our progression system before, it kind of just felt like there were just a bunch of bars going up all the time. It was pretty complex and so we've simplified it. But the exciting thing about it is that, not only is it easier to understand, but it has a lot of cool new rewards too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a whole rewards track where you're updating things like emotes and Play of the Game [intros]--even loot boxes and legendary loot boxes. There's a whole Ascended State where you get a really cool icon with VFX on it that lets you and other players know just how much time you've put into each one of your heroes. We have a new Hero [Skill Rating] system coming out, so you're going to know how good [you are] not just at a [particular] role, but how well you play each of your heroes in Competitive. You can see which ones you're better at, and which ones you're worse at. We also have a new advanced hero info panel, where you can look up stats on what all of the different heroes do.</p><p dir="ltr">We're bringing Stadium to Quick Play, which is one of the biggest requests that our players have for the mode, and that's coming with cross-play enabled. We have four new heroes coming to Stadium, a new game mode, Payload Race, and two brand new maps for it. You mentioned Wuyang, our new support hero, is coming, and we have changes to Roadhog too. Lucio Ball is back--this time in third-person--and there's mouse and keyboard support coming to console.</p><p dir="ltr">We even have [things] on the cosmetic side. Kiriko's getting this skateboard emote [that lets her] travel around the maps riding a skateboard. The Mythic [Character] skins and Mythic Weapon skins are really cool this season… It's a huge update to Overwatch. This is going to be one of the biggest seasons we've ever had for the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is this the biggest update in terms of sheer content? Because I feel like, based on what you're saying, I don't know if there's ever been an update quite this big.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I don't want to jump into hyperbole and say like this is the biggest one coming, but man, it's… it is big.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>There's truth to that, though, to some degree. I think our team has been getting better and better about structuring our seasons to where, now, we can create some really big beats. Season 9 felt like a big change in the game, and then they went to Season 12 which had Juno and a bunch of competitive updates. 15 and 16 [added] Perks and Stadium. And now 18, is another massive update for Overwatch. We've been getting a lot more efficient and a lot better at planning over time, which has led to these big moments for Overwatch. [We can now] decide, like, "Hey, how do we want to change the game for the middle of the year?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I can sense that. Even with your newest hero, Wuyang--he feels extremely different.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Yeah, there's a lot of unique mechanics and abilities with Wuyang that I just think it'd be great to touch on. He can surf on his own private wave and cruise around the map. He gets this speed boost with it, too, and is able to jump over gaps and things like that. He can use his staff to create this wave of water in front of him that knocks down enemies, and can turn himself or allies basically into ticking time bombs by imbuing them with water. But what I'm most excited about with Wuyang is his primary fire. He shoots out this orb, and you can kind of do it rapid fire, but at any moment, you can also take control of it and steer it, turning it into a guided missile. Even if they take cover, you can actually bend it around a corner. There's some skill expression here. It takes a little bit of practice to actually be able to do it, but once you get it, it feels so satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> I think he's one of the best support heroes we've ever made. He's an example of what a support is in Overwatch 2, where you can have a ton of impact through your offense and can make game-changing plays. Wuyang is dynamic in the sense that he has to go from offense to defense quite quickly. All of your attention is gonna be on the primary fire, landing some of those shots, and tracking people down, but then you have these defensive options that you're going to [need to] be really timely with. His guardian wave is this big wave that gives healing and gives heal boosts--it can change the fight instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">I think players are going to really love him. I know we're not supposed to play favorites, but he's a joy to play with and I think he's really special.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think he's also one of the first heroes where his skills and powers feel almost more magical rather than technological, right? I feel like Overwatch historically has always leaned more into tech rather than magic. Was that a conversation that had to be had when developing him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Oh yeah, and we have those conversations all the time. We had those conversations a lot with both Hanzo and Genji, you know, because when they summon the dragon, that feels like a pretty magical thing there as well. We do have our own internal explanations for that that we'll actually get into at some point with our players, but we're not quite ready to yet. I guess all I can really say right now is that Overwatch is a science fiction game, and so there is an explanation behind the way those work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>At this point, do you feel like you're still fighting that initial nature of being conservative? Like you both said, for a long time, Overwatch was more conservative. Are you still fighting that hesitation or is it like, "Nope, we're all in"?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I think the team has left a lot of the hesitation about being conservative behind. The question for us really is, how big do we go with releases for Overwatch? Because there's two sides of this coin. There's an active player base that really appreciates the way that the game plays right now, you know. But we also see that, anytime we do make a big release for the game, players respond to it really positively.</p><p dir="ltr">So we want to keep going big. I think what we want to do is explore how big we really can go for Overwatch. And I think as we hit seasons like 18 here, and we see players' excitement, that gives us the confidence to know this isn't just the right direction--this is something that we can expand on in the future. We can keep pushing the boundaries of what a release for Overwatch can be.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the implementation of Stadium, did you see a spike in people playing Overwatch 2? If so, how is retention following that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>There was a <em>huge</em> spike of people jumping into Stadium when it first came out. I think we went public at one point saying that over 50% of play hours in Overwatch were in Stadium. And when we do have new modes for the game, we do always see that initial burst of excitement and then it'll kind of taper off after that. And Stadium did taper off, but not to the extent that our other modes have. It's still, I think, our third most popular mode in the game right now, just behind Quick Play and Competitive.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> We view Stadium as one of the main ways to play Overwatch, and Season 18 as almost Stadium's 1.0 launch. A lot of players are clamoring to have Quick Play in there. They're clamoring for something that's a little bit more brief and doesn't have a rank associated with it. So with Quick Play, it's a best-of-five round structure and you power up your hero even faster as well.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the other main piece of feedback from players is, "Hey, my favorite hero isn't here." So we're continuing to release new heroes into Stadium. We're going to be doing that throughout the rest of the year and there's four this season who I'm really excited about. Tracer in particular. I think… She's a little wild.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I'm super excited about Winston jumping into Stadium. I love playing as him and using his mobility. Sometimes with Winston, you just feel like you're holding down primary fire a little bit too long to actually be doing what you want to do. [With Stadium], you can really juice his gun and it feels so satisfying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you land on those four heroes and what are some other heroes who you see people clamoring for and are on the docket? If you can't say right now, can you share what gameplay styles you're focused on bringing in?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> There's a lot of things we look at when we're looking at heroes for Stadium. First and foremost is how well we feel like we can make a really cool set of abilities for them. We want every hero in there to really double down on "hero fantasy." We want to make sure that comes across to our players.</p><p dir="ltr">For the first few seasons of Stadium, we really tried to have at least a few heroes per role. Eventually, I think we're going to have to break that pattern and start moving into other patterns. I think we'll start seeing, you know, maybe different numbers of heroes coming to Stadium with different role ratios.</p><p dir="ltr">We want to make sure that heroes that we know a lot of people play are available there. Like Alex said, you know, we have a lot of people saying things like, "Hey, I'm just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for my hero to join the cast." So we want to make sure that we're opening up that funnel.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a few heroes we're avoiding, you know? Like Widowmaker, who is a controversial hero that's designed around a one-shot [kill]. I think that there's probably some learnings we need to do with how we build those heroes--how we build counters for some of the sharper mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>There was a recent IGN article in which you said that you'd "dropped the ball with story in Overwatch 2," and I thought that was interesting to bring up this far removed from the announcement of PvE being dropped. So do you have plans to course-correct going forward?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> Yeah. When you look back at the history of Overwatch, there are moments where there was more or less lore--where we were developing more or less story for players. And one of the things that we hear from our community--and we've been hearing it a lot lately--is that they just want there to be more of that in the game. That it feels like we're doing less of it.</p><p dir="ltr">So I think I'm actually really excited for the Wuyang hero trailer to come out and for people to get a glimpse at that hero and maybe how they tie into the bigger, broader universe. It's something that I can't really go into a lot right now, but I'm excited for players to be able to get in touch with more lore over the coming seasons this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Based on that, do you plan on having more heroes come from similar factions or the same countries? I know that, for a while there, there was more avoidance since you're trying to represent a lot of different backgrounds. But at the same time--and with the lack of PvE--do you find yourself thinking "Well actually let's add this person's best friend and have more storytelling through voice lines?" Or "Let's try to add folks from the same factions."</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>Yeah, there's a delicate balance to it. We don't want to make it feel like heroes are appearing out of nowhere and like [players always have] this brand-new thing to learn. I think we've created a universe over quite some time that is very rich with tons of different characters from different factions, and we want to lean into that more and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some of the things you saw in the Freya story trailer earlier this year link back to some of the things we've already built in the world. We want to make sure that we're pulling from that world because there are characters that people have only gotten glimpses of, that they love, or that could end up as heroes one day.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>As far as where our heroes hail from, we do still like to spread heroes out across like all over the globe. That's a really important value that we've got. We do like our heroes to feel like they represent Earth, but not in the strictest sense. We don't have 40% of our heroes from China and India, which is maybe what a true representation of the global population would be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Has the team considered any other avenues for more large-scale storytelling? I'm sure you see the success of series like Arcane and Castlevania on Netflix, and I wonder if that has been something that you're interested in pursuing.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> The team would love to have something like that come out. You know, we're also fans of those shows and fans of those universes. To have something like that for Overwatch would be really, really cool. But I can't really discuss the plans for future stuff like that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I completely understand. I just ask because it's something that I want to manifest into the universe. But on the subject of Overwatch's story--and now that we're a little bit more removed from what happened--do you want to go into a little bit more detail on why things didn't really work out with story missions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I know Blizzard holds their cards kind of close to their chests sometimes. But I don't think we really saw the critical success that we wanted and it forced us to really analyze where we were putting our time and resources. At the end of the day, what we've been telling our players is that we want to make the game that they want to play. And the game that our players have been playing is this competitive, PvP-focused hero shooter. We really realized that that was the game that we needed to invest our time into.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the release of our sole campaign, we did a really big pivot internally on the team. We wanted to focus on what it means to be a best-in-class hero shooter. What are the competitive systems that we need in order to do that? What are some of the other systems?</p><p dir="ltr">In the year since that, we've focused on evolving the game our players play--on how we turn it into the best version of Overwatch it can be. That's why we started doing these much bigger systems, like Perks and Stadium. Now that we've corrected the course, it gives us the opportunity to make bigger steps with the game. And some of those are things that players are asking for, but then some of them are really big surprises. That's the future for Overwatch right now.</p><p><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity, readability, and brevity.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a high-profile failure in Concord and a high-profile success in Astro Bot last year, PlayStation is looking to adjust its strategy to incorporate fewer live service games, more big franchises, and stricter oversight of its owned studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a>, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst says the company is hoping to mitigate future big, expensive risks with future games. “I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord was not a cheap failure. Analysts estimate Sony spent around $250m on the game, only for it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">sell so poorly</a> that Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever">shut it down two weeks after launch</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">shuttered its developer</a>, Firewalk Studios, not long after. By contrast, Astro Bot also launched last year to universal acclaim, winning multiple awards and <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/astro-bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling 2.3 million copies as of March 2025</a>, one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences between the two games are myriad, certainly, and their development stories are quite different as well. But what Hulst has taken away from this is that there needs to be more supervision of Sony's owned studios to ensure that games veering in the direction of Concord are spotted before they become expensive failures, so they can be canceled or corrected in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways,” Hulst said. “The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial Times spoke to multiple Sony studio heads, who said that this oversight means more focus on group testing, more communication between internal Sony studios, and closer relationships between the studios' top executives. “If we’re heading towards a giant landmine, like there’s another studio making exactly the same game, that’s good information,” said Jason Connell, art director at Ghost of Yōtei studio Sucker Punch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That comment rings especially poignant in light of Concord's failure, which analysts say occurred for a number of reasons, including an oversaturation of multiplayer, live service shooters. Hulst suggests in the interview that PlayStation isn't as intent on churning out live service games as it used to be. That said, PlayStation does have Bungie's Marathon coming up before March 2026, a game that has<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"> a number of Bungie fans concerned</a> amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">staff layoffs</a>, and a general lack of information as to what the game entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's another strategy Hulst also wants to pursue: he wants more, massive Sony IP. Astro Bot's success has come about over the course of multiple games, with the little robot icon growing in popularity each time. According to Financial Times, Hulst wants studios to be thinking about how their IP can be turned into bigger and bigger franchises over time, following in the footsteps of The Last of Us and Uncharted. “We take a very intentional approach to IP creation . . . understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently on the docket, PlayStation has Ghost of Yōtei and Lost Soul Aside coming this year, with Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls and Housemarque's Saros for 2026. Other games such as Fairgames, Marvel's Wolverine, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Marathon, and more remain in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

"Players are starting to wonder if the MESA was a dream all along. A mirage."</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that "[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening." While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: "Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug."</p><p>For the last week, climbers have been subjected to the bitter, whipping cold of the Alpine biome. But sometimes you'd rather free solo El Capitan than the north face of the Eiger. To give us all a break from the cold, the team is forcing Mesa as the game's third biome "until further notice," which they specify will be later this week.</p><p>On the beta side of the game, the developers are working on reenabling rising lava in the final level, the Kiln, and testing a photosensitive mode.</p><p>Previously, the team has been working to quickly update the game with new features, with the most recent being getting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-is-now-steam-deck-verified-and-the-cannon-glitch-is-fixed/1100-6534220/" data-ref-id="1100-6534220">Steam Deck Verified checkmark</a> on their game, as well as adding optional cannibalism to the game in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">Totally Normal Update</a> and adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">aforementioned Mesa biome</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Gamescom 2025, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> what it has been calling the largest upgrade ever made to its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. The backbone is, of course, the advent of the Blackwell architecture previously seen in the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>The Ultimate tier will be updated with RTX 5080-class (a server equivalent to the desktop GPU) GPU hardware and AMD Zen 5 CPUs. The new server hardware will deliver 62 teraflops of compute performance and a 48GB frame buffer, not to mention a performance uplift of up to 2.8x compared to the previous generation, partly thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>While important, though, this hardware upgrade is just a portion of the enhancements coming to GeForce NOW that NVIDIA showed off to press, Wccftech included, at a dedicated Gamescom 2025 event. One of the new features, Cinematic Quality Streaming or CQS, is actually a set of features that includes additions like YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit HDR, AV1 support with RPR (Reference Picture Resampling), new AI-based sharpness filters to reduce noise and artifacts and make games' heads-up display (HUD) clearer, and DPI awareness. The latter is important, NVIDIA Product Marketing Manager Michael McSorley explained, because sometimes GeForce NOW didn't quite catch the correct native resolution of a user device (especially laptops) and started the streaming at a lower resolution. As a result, the user got a blurrier image that certainly didn't impress them with sharpness.</p>



<p>Overall, Cinematic Quality Streaming makes quite a bit of a difference when viewed in person side-by-side, especially in a highly detailed game like Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong, which supports full path tracing. The finer details, such as vegetation and the main character's hair, were a lot sharper with CQS enabled, reducing one of the long-standing visual downsides of cloud gaming when compared to local gaming: image compression. Of course, the difference will likely be better appreciated on a large 4K display. It should be noted that, barring the first two CQS features, the rest will also be available on non-Blackwell servers.</p>



<p>NVIDIA then flexed the power of the Blackwell-enhanced GeForce NOW experience directly against the most powerful console on the market, Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro. The game selected was CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which the new Ultimate tier can handle easily with path tracing enabled and 4K@120FPS streaming. By comparison, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game was set to the Ray Tracing mode, which, however, locks the frame rate to 40FPS, and is also much inferior visually compared to the PC version's path tracing. With three times as powerful hardware as the PS5 Pro, NVIDIA boasts that the best console-like experience can be streamed via its upgraded cloud gaming service.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GeForce NOW Gamescom 2025 Demo Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K1kk8coHbg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>GeForce NOW is also evolving when it comes to latency, another inherent problem with cloud gaming. The NVIDIA servers already supported Reflex, but they are now being updated with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/rivermax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivermax</a> hardware packet pacing, an NVIDIA technology that enables direct data transfers to and from the GPU, delivering 'best-in-class throughput and latency with minimal CPU utilization for streaming workloads', according to the GeForce company. </p>



<p>In addition to that, NVIDIA has been working in the last couple of years with various ISPs to persuade them to add L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput). This network protocol has the potential to reduce latency when sending and receiving packets. Unfortunately, L4S has to be adopted by the ISPs; so far, Comcast, T-Mobile, and BT Group have done it, but there's many more to go across all the countries supported by GeForce NOW. Moreover, the router you're using must support L4S, too, which means even if your ISP has added L4S to its network, you may have to change the router if you've got an old one. It is, of course, far from guaranteed that ISPs will issue everyone a new compatible router for free.</p>



<p>On the local devices, NVIDIA is adding support for 90FPS streaming on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-native-steam-deck-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">native Steam Deck app</a>, 120FPS streaming on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, 4K@120FPS streaming on LG TVs via the native GFN app, 5K@120FPS on LG OLED monitors, and 1080P@360FPS or 1440P@240FPS. At 360FPS streaming, NVIDIA showed an end-to-end latency (not just network latency) of less than 30ms, with peaks of 15-17ms, making it more than viable to play competitive shooters via GeForce NOW. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and we asked Michael McSorley whether NVIDIA would ever try to shelve a few more milliseconds of latency by creating a direct connection from the wireless gamepad to the GeForce NOW servers, like Stadia did. The Product Marketing Manager said it could happen, though they'd have to find a suitable partner on the gamepad side.</p>



<p>There's more, as NVIDIA is also extending the GFN support of racing wheel devices as well as expanding accessibility through the 2200 new Steam games that will benefit from the new Install-to-Play feature, not to mention a limited-time GFN trial available to stream Fortnite directly via Discord.</p>



<p>One thing is clear: NVIDIA already offers the best cloud gaming experience, and all these improvements can only bring it closer to the experience of playing locally. We'll need to do private testing of the new Blackwell-architecture GeForce NOW servers to say exactly how much. The rollout will gradually begin next month with only 20 games supported, though that list is expected to grow rapidly.</p>

              <p>After nearly 50 years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">Cracker Barrel</a> changed its logo last week. You probably heard or read something about it, as news of the change and the reaction to it became one of the biggest topics on the internet. And so, somehow, that leads us to a person online replacing the Cracker Barrel logo with the entirety of <em>Robocop</em> from 1987.</p> <p>On August 23, a few days after the Cracker Barrel news had swept the internet and sparked countless blogs and articles (<a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">even we wrote about it</a>), Twitter user Kodiak posted to the dying social media site the “full 1987 film <em>RoboCop</em> rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo.” You might be wondering a few things, namely: Why? Well, don’t worry, Kodiak doesn’t want to leave you with a mystery. Why did they re-render <em>RoboCop</em> as the Cracker Barrel logo?&nbsp; “Because nothing matters,” <a href="https://x.com/thisiskodiak/status/1959402871939862841">posted Kodiak</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The full 1987 film RoboCop rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo. Because nothing matters. <a href="https://t.co/0e1UjAezJY">pic.twitter.com/0e1UjAezJY</a></p> <p>— Kodiak (@ThisIsKodiak) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsKodiak/status/1959402871939862841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is this the ideal way to watch <em>RoboCop</em>? Some might say yes. <a href="https://x.com/jenny____r/status/1959668520452862246">At least one person has seemingly watched the film on their big screen TV</a>, which is fun to think about. Another question you might be pondering—between never-ending thoughts about Cracker Barrel’s new, boring logo and what it means in relation to modern-day society—is a simple one: Is this legal? I’m not a lawyer. I’d probably say no, but these days it really does seem like law and order is out the window, and the rich and powerful can do whatever they want. Ohhh….wait, now I get why they picked <em>RoboCop</em> for this joke. Funny! (Shout out to <em><a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-b-testing-your-anti-woke-meltdown-e1a04224ffbb38b6">Garbage Day</a></em> for spotting this.)</p> <p>Anyway, go ahead and watch <em>RoboCop</em> until Twitter kills the video. At the moment, it has over 550k views, so it seems like Elon Musk and whoever still works at Twitter don’t care. Or they forgot the password to the account that lets them delete stuff. Either way, enjoy <em>RoboCop</em>. Or you can go buy and play that <a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568">awesome <em>RoboCop</em> game from a few years back</a>. Do both at the same time? What do I care? I’m not your dad.</p>

                <p>Sony recently announced a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBA 2K26 PS5 Slim Bundle</a> is set to arrive on September 5. As the name implies, this will include the PS5 Slim model with a disc drive, a DualSense controller, and the upcoming NBA 2K26. It's arriving on September 5, the same day NBA 2K26 launches on PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch. We're still waiting on pricing details for the new bundle, but considering Sony <strong>increased the PS5's price on August 21</strong>, we're expecting it to be more expensive than previous bundles. Still, bundles like this are always popular, so set a reminder for September 5 if you're thinking about picking one up.</p><div title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4175" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">Pricing TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle pulls together a PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Controller, and a digital voucher for NBA 2K26.

The base PS5 Slim now costs $550 (was $500) and PS5 Slim Digital costs $500 (was $450--and before that was $400 at launch), we're expecting this to be pricier than previous bundles. For example, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases/1100-6534138/" data-ref-id="1100-6534138">PS5 Slim Digital Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Bundle</a> was previously available for just $400, offering a value of $570. The bundle didn't last long at that promotional price, and we'd expect this upcoming NBA 2K26 bundle to be much more expensive. At the very least, we're hoping the bundle ends up being cheaper than buying everything individually. Expect to learn more as we quickly approach its September 5 release date. Availability of the bundle will vary by region. Most markets should find it on PlayStation Direct, though other local retailers may also have inventory.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're worried about pricing--or don't need NBA 2K26, consider grabbing a PS5 at Amazon.

                <p>Besides creating many iconic cult movies like Halloween, The Thing, and Escape From New York, you may also be aware that filmmaker John Carpenter is an ardent fan of video games. Has he then finally decided to make one? Well, yes and no. Toxic Commando may bear his name in the title, but the real credit goes to developer and publisher Saber Interactive. Still, after playing this apocalyptic co-op first-person shooter for the first time at Gamescom 2025, I see how it bears his influence. This isn't just a cynical marketing stunt to put his name on the box.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to kind of tap into those '80s horror and over-the-top action films like Big Trouble in Little China, so we reached out to Carpenter, who was like, 'Yeah, this is great,'" said Saber's chief creative officer, Tim Willits. "He's played the game with us, he's helped with some concepts, he's been good about saying, 'Focus on these types of things when you tell this type of story.'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDfS-wDsmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ahDfS-wDsmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It may be more accurate to describe Carpenter as having more of a consulting role rather than being deeply involved in development. But his role is also more hands-on at least in some areas: The director famously composed some of the themes for his own influential movies, and has written music that will be incorporated into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While not directly referencing Carpenter's back catalog, the story of Toxic Commando, about a corporation seeking a new limitless power source that unwittingly awakens an evil entity, is totally the kind of idea I can imagine he might have conceived of in the peak of his filmmaking career--this evil is even named the Sludge God, which is as unapologetically B-movie as it gets.</p><p dir="ltr">Our four-player session was less focused on the story than it was on just diving into the gameplay itself. Willits recommends the best way to catch up on the backstory is through the comic book prequels Saber has produced in partnership with Dark Horse Comics.</p><p dir="ltr">"The story is very fun and quirky, but it does not get in the way," he said, though those who do want to get immersed in the story can also opt to solo the game with computer-controlled bots as teammates. That should provide a better way to appreciate the moment-to-moment chatter with the other titular commandos--the laid-back Walter, the nihilistic Ruby, the empathetic Cato, and the natural leader Astrid--each played by small-screen actors whose likenesses have also been faithfully rendered in-game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although a session cannot have everyone picking the same character, they're not bound to specific roles on the team like in, say, a hero shooter. Every player gets to have their own personal journey in terms of loadout and classes. The latter mostly refers to the mutant abilities you have equipped from a device strapped to your chest that's keeping you from being corrupted by the Sludge God's infection. Usually, this means being able to drop area-of-effect fields that your buddies can stay in to improve their defense or offense, the kind of boost you'd want when facing down hordes of undead. There's also no restriction if everyone in your party decides to play a support class, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, when it's a co-op FPS that involves blasting zombies, thoughts of Left 4 Dead aren't far behind. However, the shooter I ended up thinking about as we took on our demo mission was actually Halo, Saber having also had a hand in that game's anniversary edition remaster. Not only was the map we roamed a pretty large sandbox, with plenty of optional areas to explore and also mark with pins, we could also get around in vehicles. These are randomized in each session, so you might come across a pick-up truck or an ambulance van, or find an armored vehicle where someone can get onto the gun turret while the camera pulls back in third person for the driver. It has the same joy as piling onto a Warthog with your buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some considerations to keep in mind with the vehicles you drive, though--they need gas to run, so you might need to find fuel to top up the tank. A turret also has limited ammo, so you won't be able to use it indefinitely. Some vehicles might not have the tires to handle going up some steep and muddy slopes, and it's impressive how Toxic Commando essentially makes use of the tech seen in Saber's off-road driving sims like Mudrunner and Snowrunner to give vehicles different capabilities in a variety of situations. Again, the armored vehicles are the most capable for getting around, and come with a very handy winch that can be used for pulling down barriers in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The real technical star of the show, however, is Saber's proprietary Swarm Engine. Originally created for World War Z's huge zombie hordes, and impressively utilized for the swarm of Tyranids in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Willits said the engine has evolved to even greater heights in Toxic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">"The environments are much larger than they were in World War Z, so the swarms come in all sorts of different directions," he explained. "We have more super creatures, special monsters, but just like our upgrade progression system in World War Z and Space Marine 2, you have different classes and you can upgrade your abilities, loadouts, even some of your passives."</p><p dir="ltr">That also ensures there's never a dull moment. When following the objective of destroying specific tendril nodes so that we could reach a church, we encountered a swarm of undead. But even when exploring other points of interest, the engine keeps the map populated with enemies so that there's always something to shoot or contend with while trying to find loot and stock up on supplies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At times, the non-stop hordes can get overwhelming. Case in point: Toward the end of the mission, we reached the church and had to endure a siege of undead coming from all directions. Willits said Toxic Commando is probably the most difficult game the studio has made in years, given how much the action can ramp up. But that difficulty is managed in real-time by the Swarm Engine's AI director that's designed to also make you feel like the odds are against you.</p><p dir="ltr">"It keeps track of who you're fighting and balances the difficulty," he explained. "When you're playing and feel like, 'My god, I'm not going to survive,' and then you just pull through at the last second, a lot of that is the AI director."</p><p dir="ltr">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Turok knows a thing or two about rebirth. The original character debuted in a 1950s comic book but came to wider attention after Valiant Comics revived him as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in the early '90s. It was this comic that became the basis for the game series that began on the N64, which was arguably the most influential console-based shooter of the time after GoldenEye. Following 17 years of dormancy after the mixed reception of its 2008 self-titled reboot (while it wasn't actually a commercial flop, a sequel was nonetheless canned), Saber Interactive has stepped up to the plate to make the cycle begin anew with Turok: Origins.</p><p dir="ltr">I was admittedly skeptical when it was first announced at last year's Game Awards, as it seemed to be a third-person co-op shooter. The good news from my first hands-on at Gamescom 2025 is that the game can be played in both first- and third-person, and while this preview session was about getting a feel for the co-op PvE gameplay for up to three players, members of Saber Interactive's Madrid-based team assured us that it will also be possible to play the game solo without AI allies, so as to stay true to the original single-player experience of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUPvMp_s5nc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUPvMp_s5nc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But most importantly, Turok: Origins gets back to the fundamental core of what you want from a Turok game: killing dinosaurs with big guns.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, some twists to that formula. As the subtitle suggests, this is a revival that goes back in the timeline, to well before the original game. Turok isn't the name of a character but rather a tribe of hunters, while still very much taking its inspiration from tribes indigenous to North America. As you would expect from a team-based game, you have a choice of different classes to play as, each inspired by different spirit animals--Raven, Cougar, and Bison--which dictate the loadout and abilities you have, though you're free to change classes before each mission starts.</p><p dir="ltr">The dinos are actually referred to as Xenia, a hostile reptilian force that's predominantly made up of familiar four-legged lizards, though this also gives license to introduce some more humanoid enemies, as well as what could be best described as a troll with scales. But wisely, the first mission in this demo gave me what I wanted from the outset, which was to drop us into a prehistoric-looking jungle while being jumped by waves of raptors. They were a blast to dispatch, whether I was playing with a first- or third-person perspective, which is something that you can seamlessly switch between. The third-person option also lets you toggle which shoulder the camera is behind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The reason behind the controls feeling so good may be down to the developer confirming that the pipelines for first-person and third-person are actually separate, so they do feel distinct. You can also see some differences such as how, when hitting crouch while sprinting, you'll perform a slide in first-person but roll forward when in third-person. Melee is also an option, and even when playing in first-person, the camera will always pull back to third-person. I can see how this is more ideal for performing a variety of brutal cinematic finishers; when you've weakened a dino to the point they're glowing yellow, your prompt to move in as your hunter rips them apart from their long jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">As cool as some of these execution animations were, I couldn't do them as often as I wanted, mostly because another teammate was still raining ammo on them and finished them off before I could press the prompt in time. In a subsequent mission inside an ancient temple, the team was able to split up to tackle threats coming from different directions, which gave me more opportunity to dispatch Xenia as I saw fit. At the same time, I was also trying out each of the available, first with the automatic-toting Cougar, and then the tankier Bison and their close-range shotgun.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class also has three unique cooldown-based abilities as well as an ultimate, typical of modern class-based shooters. After a couple of missions, I found my groove with Raven's long range bow, and I was pulling off many satisfying headshots. One downside, though, was if I didn't kill them instantly, then I'd be too far away to run in for the killing blow. Despite this, it was with this Raven class that I used their abilities with the most confidence, including one where they charged up a sort of rallying cry that instantly killed weak enemies, summoned a swarm of glowing wasps to attack a nearby target, or created a temporary barrier against projectiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I nonetheless did return to Cougar for the demo's final encounter, an arena boss fight against a huge Triceratops that almost had a whiff of Monster Hunter about it. With my medium-ranged auto-plasma shots, it was a good way of landing hits from a distance while being able to dodge when it charged at me with its horns. The Cougar's ultimate is also especially useful by temporarily granting you a very powerful bow that you can let loose an infinite supply of arrows.</p><p dir="ltr">There was quite a lot to take in, as the developer ushered us through a varied and curated experience within 30 minutes. To ensure a tight pace, the dev made everyone gather in a glowing blue circle when it was time to advance to the next part of a mission--which also meant some optional paths were deliberately walled off for the demo. Even in this more linear structure, however, I still had the opportunity to use my grapple to swing up over certain walls or jump up to higher ground to take down out-of-reach enemies. That kind of platforming traversal is another hallmark from the original Turok games that carries over here.</p><p dir="ltr">While I would still prefer to be able to get the chance to experience Turok: Origins in a single-player scenario, this first hands-on has nonetheless put aside any initial doubts I might have had. In Saber Interactive Spain's hands, a franchise many had assumed would remain a fossil looks like it's getting a revival that could actually stick around this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Turok: Origins is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Physical copies for this collection are available exclusively at Amazon.

The first game, Corpse Party, tells the story of a friendship ritual gone horrifically awry after it transports high school student Ayumi Shinozaki and her friends to an alternate reality. Exploring the Heavenly Host Elementary institution, the group has to risk their sanity and safety to uncover the truth behind bone-chilling murders that occurred at the location, if they ever want to return home again. The version included in the collection is the 2021 version of the game that was released for PC, which itself is actually the third remake of Corpse Party originally released for the PS Vita in 2010.</p><p>The next game, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, is an ambitious anthology series released in 2011 that served as a sequel, prequel, midquel, <em>and</em> an alternate universe tale, all in one package. It builds on the events of the first game, offering players new perspectives on several of the original game's most critical events.</p><p>2012's Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash is billed as a midquel set that takes place during the events of Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. It tells the story of the ghost of Sachiko Shinozaki’s murderous birthday party at Heavenly Host Elementary.</p><p>Finally, Corpse Party: Blood Drive was released in 2014 and is set two months after Book of Shadows. Designed to be the ultimate conclusion to the Heavenly Host story arc, the story revolves around black magic, the end of the world, and a mission to resurrect fallen friends.</p><p>While Corpse Party: Blood Drive was the final game in the Heavenly Host story arc, it's not the end of the franchise.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suda51-wanted-the-development-of-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-be-just-as-fun-as-the-game.1280190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During Gamescom 2025 last week in Cologne, Germany, I went hands-on with No More Heroes developer Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, and came away with more questions than answers (but in the best way possible). Fortunately, I immediately transitioned from my hands-on preview to a couch, where I sat across from the game's director, Goichi Suda AKA Suda51, and his interpreter, and asked him the new questions I had.&nbsp;</p><p>But first, let me set the scene of my demo: before gameplay began, I watched a quick intro you've likely seen in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/grasshopper-manufacture-announces-romeo-is-a-dead-man-an-ultra-violent-sci">game's reveal trailer</a> that shows Romeo die, then be resurrected and turned into a space cop/FBI agent/expert mercenary/cyborg hybrid. From here, I was brought to a screen with three impeccably designed chocolates. I forgot the name of the first chocolate (and unfortunately didn't write it down), but it represented the game's easy mode; the orange chocolate I chose represented normal, and the ginger-infused chocolate was the game's hard mode. I was then thrust right into the action.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>I'm not quite sure where I was, but it was reminiscent of a junk yard; gray, foggy, and swarmed with zombies and other monstrous creatures Romeo needed to kill. Doing so was a blast, thanks to a combat system that feels fast, fluid, and visceral, with a large selection of weaponry to use. I used a machine gun, a pistol, a grasshopper-shaped rocket launcher, and a fusion rifle, of sorts, as well as a katana-like sword, a colossal two-handed sword, and more. All of them are easily accessible with a combo of buttons tied to the d-pad. I like that each gun has a different feel, and that each melee weapon features its own moveset, all in the name of dismembering and beheading hordes of zombies and everything else that stands in the way of Romeo.&nbsp;</p><p>Romeo Is A Dead Man was, by far, the bloodiest demo I saw during Gamescom, and I previewed more than two dozen games, including Resident Evil Requiem. Despite the gallons and gallons of blood, though, it comes off comedically rather than horrifically, thanks to the game's visual flair.&nbsp;</p><p>After I mowed down enough enemies in this junkyard-like area, I warped into cyberspace, another visually distinct part of the game with its own narrative ties. There was a boss at the end of this area, but I wasn't able to reach it as my time to interview Suda51 had arrived. Before diving into what I learned from my interview, I'll close out my preview thoughts here by saying I continue to grow increasingly intrigued by what the hell Romeo Is A Dead Man is doing each time I see and play it. It's hard to explain what this game is, but that's part of its charm, and I can't wait to find out how all its seemingly disparate pieces connect when it launches next year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Discussing Romeo Is A Dead Man And Grasshopper Manufacture With Suda51</h2>

<p><em><strong>Game Informer's </strong></em><strong>Wesley LeBlanc: There is a lot going on in Romeo Is A Dead Man, but from a broad approach, what are the inspirations behind the game?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Suda51: </strong>You may have noticed playing a bit of the game, but a few of the main influences and inspirations for the game are <em>Back to the Future </em>and <em>Rick and Morty</em>, which itself was inspired by <em>Back to the Future</em>. We wanted to do something with space time and time travel, and the whole thing started off with looking to those two properties.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There are so many distinct art styles in Romeo Is A Dead Man. What are some of the inspirations behind that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As far as the art and visual style go, that aspect of the game didn't have much to do with the [<em>Back to the Future </em>and <em>Rick and Morty</em>] influences. Where that came from was basically, I wanted to make sure all the staff members working on the game were able to do their best and what they're best at.</p><p>For the art, if we have one staff member good at Western-style comic book art, I'd say, "I want you to draw this scene, it'd look really great with your style." Somebody else is really good at a different style, and I would think of a scene for that person in particular to work on. It was about finding a proper rhythm for each scene, matching the content of the scene and what the characters are doing, and how it could be portrayed best.&nbsp;</p><p>I try to match up all the members of the staff to a scene, let them do the best at what they do, and jamming it all together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That's a very different director approach from what I hear about studios in the West. What's your philosophy behind that directorial style and letting people do things in their own vision?</strong></p><p>It's pretty simple, really. As far as my philosophy goes, I want it to be fun. We want to make fun games that people like playing, and we want everything about game development to be fun, too. In game development, there's a lot of heavy s*** to deal with, hard times to deal with, so I wanted not just playing the game to be fun, but the development and creation of it to be as fun as possible, too.&nbsp;</p><p>I lay out my ideas in meetings, and we might have some planning, but I let people from any department talk, tweak versions of ideas, and create a collaborative process. Anyone can cross out ideas, combine something to make new ideas, or take separate ideas and turn them into different things. We try to make it as fun as possible, and I want everyone to have as much fun as they can creating the game. We want them to know their opinions are heard and respected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do you factor in game balance with that approach?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lot of game developers don't like thinking like this, because it might "ruin the balance of the game" if there are too many ideas. I don't care about that personally; I want the game to be fun and interesting. As far as balance goes, I'll take care of that in the end. If you have a good idea, let everybody know, and in the end, I'll make sure everything is as balanced as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the team we've put together, they trust me to take care of that balance, which is why they feel free to put out different ideas they have. They can trust in me. Balance is probably one of the things I'm best at as a game developer – taking all these ideas that might not seem related, and balancing them.</p><p><strong>Can you talk to me about the process behind the game's combat design?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As far as the combat goes, that was actually mainly up to one of our lead programmers, Toru Hironaka, who has been at Grasshopper for years. I kind of left the combat and general action up to him because I know he knows what he's doing.&nbsp;</p><p>From the beginning, I knew there were going to be gun-type weapons and sword-type weapons, and I wanted to make both appealing. I knew we had to make them fun to use and as interesting as any other weapon, so I talked with Hironaka and said, 'These are the systems and action I want, do what you do best." I had other staff members give input, too.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as the action stuff goes, it's mainly Hironaka leading, but as a whole, [Romeo Is A Dead Man] came together the way it did through the power of teamwork. It's never just one guy doing everything by himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The time between your last release and Romeo Is A Dead Man [due out in 2026] is the longest in development history at Grasshopper Manufacture. Why?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The main reason it took so long is timing, basically. For example, right around when we started on Romeo Is A Dead Man, it was right about the time <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/10/22/netease-games-acquires-suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture">we left GungHo Entertainment and joined NetEase</a>, and we increased staff members, and it took them time to get used to how we do things and vice versa. Also, up through No More Heroes III, we worked on Unreal Engine 4, but Romeo Is A Dead Man is being developed in Unreal Engine 5, so our first year developing [Romeo Is A Dead Man], it was people learning Unreal Engine 5, learning how to work with each other, learning how the company works, and everyone getting used to each other and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>That's the biggest reason it took so long. It's not necessarily that the game is huge, and it wasn't the <em>worst </em>possible timing; everything just happened at the point in time that would result in us taking the most time to get the game done.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Romeo Is A Dead Man launches sometime next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/romeo-is-a-dead-man-has-so-many-art-styles-because-suda51-wanted-artists]]></content:encoded>

<p>"They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware."</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We're almost three months on from the Nintendo Switch 2's release, and while we have plenty of third-party games to come on the newer hybrid console, many developers say that they're still having issues getting hold of dev kits.</p>
<p>This comes from the folks at Digital Foundry in response to a question from a listener during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">this week's DF Direct</a> (timestamped, 8:20). Part of the question focuses on Switch 2 kits, particularly pointing out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, which runs at 30fps on the newer console (though it doesn't have a specific Switch 2 version either): "Do you think Nintendo are regretting not sharing the dev kits wider, sooner?"</p>
<p>Host John Linneman, who was at Gamescom 2025, spoke to multiple developers on the show floor where "so many of them said the same thing," and that "It's really difficult right now" to even get hold of a dev kit.</p>
<p>It sounds like the enthusiasm is there — "They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware." — but the ability to get the hardware teams need to make Switch 2 games is tough. Some were apparently told "they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility."</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Switch 2 PS5 comparsion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f4e4d5b6dfae/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2-ps5-comparsion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>DF is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">full of praise for Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2</a> so far — <em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Co-host Oliver Mackenzie also weighed in, saying "I don't really understand the strategy" Nintendo is implementing in handing out dev kits.</p>
<p>The team reports "hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people" on some "weird exclusions" and "weird inclusions" , highlighting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a> as one of the latter games: "...Some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</p>
<p>Of course, the only people who know what's actually going on with these dev kits are at Nintendo; Mouse Work, a game specifically designed to be played in Mouse Mode, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit">can't release on Switch 2 <em>until</em> the devs get a kit</a>. Nintendo is reportedly focusing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">on indie developers and smaller studios</a>, but that still leaves a lot of teams out.</p>
<p>When you get reports about some third-party games running better on Switch 2 than others; for example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">impressed</a> at Gamescom while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">did not</a>.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the Switch 2 dev kit situation in the comments</em>.</p>

              <p>It’s&nbsp;<span>highly unlikely that we’ll see <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-valve-erik-wolpaw-half-life-alyx-steam-counter-s-1848807049">a new&nbsp;<em>Portal</em> game</a> anytime soon from series creators </span>Valve. But now you can create your own<em> Portal 3</em> in a place I didn’t expect: <em>Minecraft</em>. Or you can play through 50 pre-made <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-2-is-the-better-portal-but-you-better-bring-a-f-5793326"><em>Portal</em> <em>2</em></a> puzzles via a newly released <em>Minecraft</em> mod.</p> <p>On August 22, <a href="https://portaljavaedition.net/about">a group of 20+ modders and fan devs released <em>Portal: Java Edition</em></a>, a free remake of Valve’s 2011 first-person puzzler built entirely in vanilla Minecraft using resource and data packs. That <em>technically</em> means the project, which is free to download now on PC, doesn’t use any “mods,” though the creators do include extra third-party mods that help with optimization. And you’ll likely want to install those if you plan to play. This rebuilt version of<em> Portal 2</em> in <em>Minecraft</em> is pushing the Java version of the popular crafting game hard, and it can chug on even beefy PCs without the extra mods.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal: Java Edition | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v7ZfuKZNis?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to the team behind it<em>, Portal: Java Edition</em> started development in 2020 and has taken roughly five years to complete. The mod includes all the mechanics and features from <em>Portal 2</em>, including portals (of course), lasers, light bridges, and mobility gels. The project is shipping with 50 levels spread across eight map packs. And if you burn through all of those, well, don’t worry, you can make some more, thanks to the included level editor. The level editor should be pretty easy to use for <em>Minecraft</em> vets, as it seems to function just like building anything else in Mojang’s crafting game, just with more big red buttons and companion cubes.</p> <p>To play <em>Portal: Java Edition</em>, you’ll need to own <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> on PC and then download the project’s files from GitHub. I had to download an older version of <em>Minecraft</em> to get <em>Portal</em> working in the game, but that’s not too hard and is fully supported by the official <em>Minecraft</em> launcher. Once more people are playing this and building levels in it, I expect to replay <em>Doom’s</em>&nbsp;E1M1 and the first level of<em> Super Mario Bros</em>. in the near future.</p>

<p>It has been two months since Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was released, with Hideo Kojima delivering big on yet another cinematic masterpiece that turned heads worldwide. In the short time that has followed, Kojima has busied himself promoting every angle of the game on social media and at the world tour events set up to showcase the game.</p>



<p>Many have wondered where the series goes from here, especially given the increasingly large window between releases. The first Death Stranding title dropped in 2019, and it took <strong>six years </strong>to produce a second game. Will Kojima be around for the third game? He has written a concept, but doesn’t think it’ll be him who makes Death Stranding 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hideo-kojima-make-another-death-stranding-game">Will Hideo Kojima Make Another Death Stranding Game?</h2>



<p>The Death Stranding series is equal parts emotional, action-packed, and bizarre. To outsiders, it represents a kind of walking or delivery guy simulator, but to those who have experienced it, Death Stranding is something phenomenal, tumultuous, and mind-bending.</p>



<p>That’s a touch of the sentiments handed down by fans over the last two months, anyway.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w?t=3114s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent appearance</a> on the ‘World Strand Tour’, Hideo Kojima and his team stopped off in Saudi Arabia to further promote Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. In one segment, the interviewer asked the crowd, ‘Who wants Death Stranding 3?’</p>



<p>That prompted a telling response from Kojima:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2, but I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data.</p>



<p>I hope that someone will create it for me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-says-hes-already-written-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-he-wants-someone-else-to-make-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Kojima went on to dive into the creation of Death Stranding 2, stressing that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a major spanner into the works, something that he has mentioned plenty of times in the past.</p>



<p>In June, Hideo Kojima spoke frankly about his health and the future of his company, Kojima Productions. He stressed that if his team tries to outright replicate his work when he has passed on, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-company-fail-replicate-work/">the company will fail</a>. For the last few years, Kojima has been stressing acute awareness of the fragility of life, showing a vulnerability that has made him more endearing, if nothing else.</p>

"Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility," said John Linneman, a senior staff writer for Digital Foundry. "There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things." GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing story surrounding Switch 2 from before launch and even as recently as last month. In April, a report surfaced stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/">small developers were struggling to get their hands on dev kits for the hybrid system</a>. But it's not just indie teams, as a July report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/">some AAA studios having a hard time acquiring them</a>, too. This could be why there haven't been a slew of major third-party releases, or announcements, for the system lately.</p><p dir="ltr">Oliver Mackenzie, a contributor at Digital Foundry, touched on AAA studios possibly still not getting Switch 2 dev kits. "But like there's that campfire game, you know the kind of camera campfire game, and they're getting kits, and some big developers on the other hand, who developed like AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits," said Mackenzie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chillin-by-the-fire-out-today-on-switch-2-allows-you-to-chill-by-a-fire/1100-6533581/">Chillin by the Fire is the game</a> that Mackenzie is referencing, and it launched right after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/#1">the Nintendo Direct in July</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 has broken home console sales records</a> since launching June 5. In fact, at the start of this month, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 has already sold 6 million units</a>. Looking ahead, there are rumblings about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-coming-this-september-report/1100-6534229/" data-ref-id="1100-6534229">a possible Nintendo Direct set for mid-September</a>.

              <p><em>Replaced</em> has been turning heads since it was first revealed back at E3 2021 (RIP), but actually completing the game has taken longer than anyone thought it would, including its developers at Sad Cat Studios. At long last, there’s good news, though: the team recently confirmed the gorgeous pixel art action game will arrive sometime next spring.</p> <p>That early 2026 timeframe will be a bummer to those secretly hoping <em>Replaced</em> might still sneak out onto PC and Xbox before the end of the year, but it’s better than nothing for fans who have been waiting years to finally see the cinematic cyberpunk platformer in action for themselves. After missing its original 2022 launch window, the day-and-date Game Pass game has been subject to continuous delays. A 2024 launch slipped into 2025, which has now slipped into 2026. What makes this time any different?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Replaced: Official Development Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPoyEkQePA4?start=146&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“This is the first time I’m addressing this personally and that’s because I can finally say it with confidence,” game director Yura Zhdanovich revealed in a new developer update. “<em>Replaced</em> will be released in spring of 2026. We will need just a little more time to get it polished. And to be more precise, our final trailer for the game with the exact release date will be shown later this year.”</p>  <p>Zhdanovich seems to be teasing a final date getting announced at The Game Awards 2025. Until then, <em>Replaced</em> has looked surprisingly good during its recent showing at Gamescom. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Much like<em> Silksong</em></a>, its repeated delays seem to have less to do with development woes (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">minus having to relocate because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>) than the fact that Sad Cat Studios had just been severely underestimating how much time it would take to get <em>Replaced</em> right.</p> <h2 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"><em>Replaced</em> is more than just eye-candy</h2> <p>Sporting a <em>Batman: Arkham</em>-like, combo-based combat system and tons of vibrant, detailed pixel art backgrounds, <em>Replaced</em> is exactly the kind of “hand-crafted” indie project that deserves as much production time as it can get. Add in the cinematic mood and ambiance of puzzle-platform games like <em>Inside</em> and <em>Planet of Lana</em>, and you have the recipe for something very special if Sad Cat Studios can pull it off. The latest demo of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8Buktx_K0">looks as promising as ever</a>.</p>  <div tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"> <p>“We have done more than 600 clips of animation, which effectively translates to several thousands of hand painted frames of those animations blended together with beautiful VFX, amplifying the mix between retro and modern visuals,” Zhdanovich said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We may have gotten our first look at Noah Centineo’s Ken in the upcoming Street Fighter film. Last week, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shadowy glimpse</a> at Cody Rhodes’ Guile on set. While we didn’t see much outside his lore-accurate hair, it was enough for fans to go crazy. Now, a new picture, thanks to Noah Centineo’s social media, shows us what his Ken may look like.</p>



<p>Legendary’s Street Fighter, directed by Kitao Sakurai (Bad Trip, Twisted Metal), started filming earlier this month. After it announced the loaded cast, including Warrior’s Andrew Koji as Ryu, Aquaman’s Jason Momoa as Blanka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/">50 Cent as Balrog</a>, many were cautiously optimistic about the adaptation. While no official release date is set yet, it’s not stopping some teases on set on social media, like with Noah Centineo.</p>

<p>In a new photo from the Black Adam actor, Noah Centineo shows off his muscles in his trailer. We can also see that his hair, unknown if real or fake, is down and dyed yellow. To further confirm it’s Ken, Centineo captioned the post “Road brawler”, which is a cheeky hint at the title Street Fighter. Considering how Ken looks in the games, he does seem to resemble the American-born rival of Ryu rather well. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s one thing to look the part and another to act it out. Though considering Centineo’s burgeoning action career with The Recruit, he may be a perfect fit for Ken Masters. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if more set photos regarding Street Fighter will be seen as they film in Australia. The fighting franchise is no stranger to adaptations, but many are hopeful that Legendary’s take will succeed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-one-magic-the-gathering-designer-broke-all-the-rules-and-created-a-sensation.1280142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Making a Magic: The Gathering card is a long process. To go from an idea to an actual piece of paper in a player’s hand takes <em>years</em>, with each one being discussed, tweaked, tested, proofread, illustrated, and so on as it passes between the many different teams at developer Wizards of the Coast. Unless, that is, it’s a card for the Unknown event that has become the star of every MagicCon live show in recent years, in which case the process is… a bit more loosey goosey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goose is enormous. It is a goose that you have not seen the likes of, ever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s Matt Tabak, Principal Editor at WOTC and one of the people responsible for the absurd and extremely popular Unknown event. I went to MagicCon in Las Vegas this year to finally see what Unknown was for myself, and I sat down with both Tabak and Gavin Verhey, Principal Game Designer and originator of the concept, to discuss how it got started, why it became such a hit, and how it impacts Magic as a whole. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MagicCon Las Vegas 2025 - Unknown Event and Card Photos</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, let’s cover the basics: Unknown is a way to play Magic designed specifically for the official conventions, called MagicCons, that are hosted a few times a year. It’s a Sealed event, which means you sit down, crack open some retail booster packs, and then build a deck out of whatever you happen to get. The big twist is that, alongside some special rules, you also get a little plastic bag filled with 10 random playtest cards made just for this event – they don’t have any art, their rules text is often cramped, and their faces are literally just stickers plastered over actual cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I find part of the joy of Unknown, why players enjoy it so much, is that it is not fully polished,” Verhey says. “It’s like, ‘Hey, step inside being a Magic playtester for a day.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unknown gives you a hands-on peek behind the design curtain to a degree that was previously quite rare, complete with typos, rough edges, and mechanics that don’t necessarily always <em>work </em>within Magic’s rules. They can be a little broken, hard to track, or just more powerful than anything you’d see in a real set – but the one thing they always have to be is amusing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"If you ask a Magic designer to make Magic cards in their free time, they’ll make something <em>really weird</em>.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you make a Magic card that is intended to go into a booster pack that you hope people will buy, the ultimate goal is joy and entertainment, and there are many roads to get there,” Tabak explains. “On an Unknown card, there’s basically one route to joy, and that’s to make them laugh. Every Unknown card is basically just trying to get somebody to laugh.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That could be with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/CA11b/color-pie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>inside jokes</u></a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UW13/youre-toast!" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>goofy designs</u></a>, or even silly references to the city your specific event takes place in. For instance, I opened a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RR04c/at-least-its-a-dry-heat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>At Least It’s a Dry Heat</u></a> that deals 1,000,000 damage that can’t be prevented or “compared to damage dealt by sources on the east coast,” which has been in Unknown packs for Las Vegas two years in a row now. (“It’s not any cooler, for some reason. The sun is still shining,” Tabak jokingly complains, before begrudgingly adding, “which we’re thankful for.”) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verhey can basically do whatever he wants with these cards, with fast turnaround times and way less oversight than there is while making regular sets. “I’ll be making unknown cards two-and-a-half weeks before the event happens sometimes,” he tells me, which is a far cry from the years a regular set requires. Verhey says it’s a fun creative outlet compared to the more rigid nature of making real cards, and that other members of WOTC now even randomly send him funny ideas that he’ll often drop straight into the next Unknown card pool. “If you ask a non Magic designer to make Magic cards, they’ll make Magic cards. If you ask a Magic designer to make Magic cards in their free time, they’ll make something <em>really weird</em>.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/23/stardust-deal-crop-1755907609579.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The commander for my first Unknown deck and a spell that put in a lot of work alongside it.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if one ends up clearly out of line, Verhey’s philosophy is that “everything can be fun for three rounds,” which is the most you’ll ever play with a given card in a single event. Tabak similarly emphasizes that “high impact is a priority for these Unknown cards, because [people] have to be immediately wowed and immediately inspired to build decks around them.” That’s due in part to the unique format Verhey has developed for Unknown over the dozen or so times it’s been run since its inception in 2023. It has you building a 60-card Commander deck with no color restrictions that you then play 1v1, which encourages building around a splashy legendary creature and then cramming in as many of the wildest playtest cards as you can reasonably manage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, my commander for the first of the two Las Vegas Unknown events I joined was a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RZ04r/the-sprinkler-of-stardust" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Sprinkler of Stardust</u></a>, which has the extremely strange ability to turn instant and sorcery cards into creatures that then cast themselves when they deal combat damage. My gameplan ended up revolving around punching my opponent with big spells like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/89/bad-deal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bad Deal</u></a> as many times as I could manage, which was equal parts delightful, devastating, and wholly unique in my three decades of playing Magic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That commander is itself a reference to both a powerful card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/216/winota-joiner-of-forces" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Winota, Joiner of Forces</u></a> and the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/introducing-the-commander-format-panel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Commander Format Panel</u></a> member known for championing it, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/luastardust.com" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lua Stardust</u></a>. There have been dozens of nods to Magic community members across the history of Unknown, including <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+runner&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=set" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a whole series of “Runners”</u></a> as a shoutout to the group <a href="https://loadingreadyrun.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LoadingReadyRun</u></a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+knight&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=set" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a round of “Knights”</u></a> as a wink to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@commandcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Command Zone</u></a>, both popular channels that regularly work with WOTC on collaborations. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“MagicCon, in so many ways, is about the people that come." - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“MagicCon, in so many ways, is about the people that come,” Verhey says, “and I was like, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool to give back to the community?’” He sees these personal references as both a way to thank the creators who helped advocate for Unknown back when it was still a wild experiment, as well as a fun “quest” for fans as they then go hunting the show floor for signatures or custom doodles on the otherwise blank cards they opened. “Like everything else I did, I pitched it to one person, they’re like, ‘Sounds great,’ and I said, ‘Sold!’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, when Verhey first pitched the idea for Unknown as a whole, he was confident it would be shot down. It all started when WOTC Senior Operations Manager Scott Larabee asked him to run an event at MagicCon Philadelphia in 2023, but didn’t have any guidance as to what that should look like beyond being a “spectacle event” to excite people. Events with oddball rules were nothing new, but the idea for these playtest cards came from Verhey’s desire to do something that could only come from WOTC’s game design team. His thought before pitching it? “It is going to get killed for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was worried about it because it’s essentially making new Magic cards that are never playtested and put out into the world, which is a thing we often don’t like to do. We like to show our high polish and our high gloss and everything. And, historically, there’s been a lot of rigor around these kind of things. Even the playtest cards for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/mystery-booster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mystery Booster</u></a>, there was a lot of time and scrutiny put on those cards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he pitched it all the same and, to his surprise, he got the blessing of both Vice President of Design Aaron Forsythe and Communications Director Blake Rasmussen, which was all he needed to be off to the races. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/22/img-6232-1755905253401.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Five Unknown cards with custom doodles done by a friend of mine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Verhey describes the first Unknown event as his “weird little side project” (“It was just me doing it in my free time”), printing all the cards out himself and spending all day stickering them by hand in Philadelphia right before the show with the help of a few members of the event staff (“We had no idea how long it was going to take”). When they realized they still needed to make the booster packs, they dumped the “thousands upon thousands of cards” they had just assembled into Verhey’s suitcase and shook it around to randomize them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so nervous. I was terrified,” Verhey recalls – but the stakes at the time were actually fairly low in the grand scheme of things. Not many people even knew the event was happening, and both he and Tabak agree that it wouldn’t <em>really </em>have been a big deal if it hadn’t gone well, because that would have just meant they don’t do it again. But it did go well, quickly becoming the talk of the show and immediately being put on the schedule for the next MagicCon, and then growing into one of their marquee draws ever since. They’ve even added a charity drive to part of the event each time, which Verhey admits always gets him a little teary-eyed as the amount they raise continues to go up. “Every show we add more seats, every show we do more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tabak says that WOTC does encourage individuals to take on “aspirational” projects from time to time but, even in that context, he describes the things Unknown is doing and its impressive popularity as an anomaly. “You’d be surprised [by] the number of things that were just a two-person idea or one-person idea that grew into something special – very, very few, perhaps none, are on the level of Unknown, though.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Every show we add more seats, every show we do more.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unknown still operates outside of WOTC’s usual card making process, but Verhey says the quality did vastly improve when Tabak offered his assistance, as it’s the editing team’s job to make sure cards are as close to perfect as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we first learned about these cards that Gavin had just put out into the world by himself – as a team, professionally, we were horrified,” Tabak explains as Verhey smiles alongside him. “Now, personally, I was delighted, and I knew I had to get on board with this, so I immediately hounded Gavin and said, ‘Why don’t you let me look at those cards this time before we send them out into the world?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with a bit more oversight, Tabak tells me they still get to break the rules with these cards when it comes to things like typesetting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On real typeset cards, we have standards to maintain some measure of readability, we can only put so much text on a card,” he says. “On the playtest cards, we can be a little more <em>forgiving</em>.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tabak describes this as an advantage, but his apprehensive tone while doing so betrays the slight discomfort this clearly still causes the editor side of him. Indeed, they both laugh as Verhey teases that “sometimes Matt will be like, ‘Gavin, your card doesn’t fit,’ and I’m like, ‘I can print it out and all the text is on there; I don’t know what to tell you.’”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/23/ego-prof-crop-1755907667292.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two Unknown cards inspired by creators in the community - Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson of Game Grumps (left) and Brian "The Professor" Lewis of Tolarian Community College (right)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The way they physically make the playtest cards has matured, too, no longer resting on the shoulders of Verhey and a very large suitcase. They are still individually stickered by hand, but that’s now handled at the offices of WOTC’s event partner, <a href="https://www.pastimesevents.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pastimes</u></a>, over the course of multiple weeks, with Verhey saying the scale of each Unknown event is “ultimately capped, to some degree, by our ability to just sticker these cards.” (He jokes about considering giving players uncut sheets of printed stickers so they can assemble their own cards, to which Tabak replies, “What if we just give all 600 players scissors? What could go wrong?”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The structure of the event itself has evolved as well, with player feedback being used to iterate a bit each time. The very first one was normal 40-card Limited, with all the participants split between two teams that they could win points for in a larger competition. It didn’t take long for Verhey to add a commander to the mix, but even that started with the regular color identity rules before first allowing <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Partner" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Partner</u></a> commanders to open things up more and then finally getting rid of color restrictions altogether. The goal behind that is to make sure people can use these wacky cards more reliably, but the variety between shows is also just part of the appeal for anyone who goes to multiple MagicCons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think one of the things about Unknown is, to some degree, it has to keep changing and it can’t be the same thing forever,” Verhey says. “So I’m running this current Commander version right now, but we could do something different at a future one, and that's the beauty of Unknown. People have so much faith in it at this point, they’re like, ‘I’m going to sign up, I’m going to come to see this thing, we’ll see what happens.’ And I might totally change the format at some point, which could be pretty fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s on us to evolve a ruleset based on what set is in the spotlight at the time, kind of match that and bring them something that they can’t find [in regular Sealed],” Tabak adds on. The Las Vegas event I attended was primarily tied into <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/tarkir-dragonstorm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</u></a>, with <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+devoted&amp;order=name&amp;as=full&amp;unique=cards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>special creatures</u></a> linked to its five clans, but the card pool also had <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UU01/dialogue-tree" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plenty</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RC08/new-magic-game-plus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>of</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RW02d/save-point" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RPG</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UU03d/higher-level-zone-monster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>references</u></a> as an homage to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-2025"><u>Final Fantasy crossover set</u></a> that had just come out. Tabak is quick to point out that there are always a lot of newcomers, too – some of whom have no idea what they are getting into before they sit down at the table. “There are definitely people that are surprised when we hand them the playtest cards. They’re like, ‘I don’t know what this is, do I just put it in my backpack?’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The number one goal for me is just let people have fun and make them smile and delight them – and if I learn anything, that’s a nice bonus.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was curious how much those playtest cards are actually “playtesting” something, and if WOTC uses Unknown as a real testing ground for ideas given how quickly they can go from concept to public feedback, but it turns out this really is mostly just them having fun. “I'd say [Unknown cards are] like 85% nonsense,” Verhey says, “5-10% ‘here’s a thing we actually tried for the set it was associated with that we didn’t end up using,’ [...] and maybe 5% are like, ‘I actually think this could be cool, let’s see what people think about this.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He wouldn’t give any indication as to which ones fall into that final category, but Verhey says he <em>has </em>used the popularity of some cards in Unknown as “ammo” to convince people internally that something similar could be a good idea for a real set. Besides, even as unofficial, stickered cards, he recognizes that some people have started to take them more seriously, using them in casual Commander decks or even their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-onlin3-vintage-cube-tournament-black-lotus-prize-pool"><u>cubes</u></a> (a collection of cards that make up a custom Draft set). “The number one goal for me is just let people have fun and make them smile and delight them – and if I learn anything, that’s a nice bonus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard not to be at least a little bit amazed by both the almost grassroots rise of the Unknown event and the surprisingly bootstrap way it gets made within the multibillion-dollar corporation that is Wizards of the Coast. Tabak says it’s a testament to the company’s culture that this sort of thing is encouraged, but it has still grown far bigger than anyone expected it to (including its creator), going from shaking typo-filled cards in a suitcase to filling up convention floors and raising money for good causes. When I ask if it feels like they sort of got away with something here, Tabak’s response is unequivocal: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Absolutely. And we’re going to keep getting away with it, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead.1280139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering it was revealed to the world with a trailer that featured four zombie-blasting soldiers singing along to Bon Jovi’s “You Give Love a Bad Name”, I expected <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</a> to be much funnier than it is. Inspired in equal measure by the supernatural horror and buddy action movies of the 1980s, it is big and dumb and goofy… yet never as batshit bananas as you’d expect for a game that’s quite literally about fighting an entity called the Sludge God. But while it may not be that <em>funny</em>, it is <em>fun</em>. You may have already forgotten about that 2023 reveal trailer, but after playing three hours of its co-op missions, I don’t think Toxic Commando is going to fade into the background thanks to its surprisingly solid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-alike antics.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is presented akin to a story campaign shooter with cutscenes, plot points, and a lore-dropping man-in-the-chair vaguely modelled after John Carpenter himself, Toxic Commando is clearly designed to be a regular destination for a team of four friends who can run through its missions on repeat. Each expedition takes place on a reasonably-sized open map, dotted with a handful of optional objectives and loot caches alongside the quest’s main goals. With no ticking timer or shrinking circle, you can take your time to collect everything, scour every point-of-interest, and generally mess around with your pals before pushing onwards to the mission’s finale. It’s surprisingly leisurely… at least until the horde applies the pressure. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Saber Interactive, Toxic Commando is built on the studio’s now-signature horde technology that renders hundreds of sprinting zombies simultaneously, allowing for enemies to clamber up walls like a reverse waterfall of rotting flesh. In many ways, Toxic Commando feels like a successor to the game where this tech originated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>, and even features near-identical mechanics – during frequent hold-the-line defence objectives, you mow down incoming enemies with the same array of emplaced machineguns, mortars, and electrified grids. It’s just that this time it’s all rendered with a gloriously gross horror aesthetic. Who wants zombies to look like humans when they can look like lamp-eyed freaks from the death dimension?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those freaks burst and break when they’re introduced to the hot lead dispensed by a very healthy arsenal. They’re all based on real-world guns (aside from the wildly powerful rail gun, which scatters foes like bowling pins) and divided up into your regular groups of shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and other formats not beginning with “S”. Saving them from feeling utterly ordinary is how they fire with the exaggerated bravado of an ultra-violent b-movie – all sputtering muzzles, wide bullet spread, and explosive impacts. Legs are severed, ribcages torn open, and brains pinwheel out of busted skulls. It’s all as squelchy and sinewey as you’d hope from a game associated with the director of The Thing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your choice of loadout defines the combat experience much more than the four character classes, which feel like minor augmentations to standard FPS action rather than crucial battlefield roles. Each is defined by a single special ability – the Operator uses a drone that automatically bombards enemies for a few seconds, the Strike can unleash a barrage of energy blasts, the Medic has an area-of-effect heal, and the Defender can put up a damage-absorbing barrier. At least during my hours of play, these abilities came in handy during a pinch but did little to direct how I played. Perhaps filling out the skill tree will give each class stronger definition, but right now it seems like the regular shooting is the main event.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s admittedly very little new or experimental in Toxic Commando, but what’s here is genuinely good fun. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mowing down a lot (<em>a lot</em>) of zombies is the crux of Toxic Commando’s objectives. Sometimes that’ll involve the genre-trademark special infected that largely work exactly as Left 4 Dead dictated (sticky ones that grab you, tanky ones that charge at you, gross ones that spit at you.) Elsewhere you’ll need to unload a belts-worth of ammunition into a tangled mess of tentacles, or use demolition charges to blow some kind of growth to smithereens. It’s mostly by-the-numbers co-op shooter fare, but across the few missions I’ve played there’s the odd one that shines brighter. One quest sees the map covered by a Fortnite-ish, life-sapping storm, and the only way to navigate between the shielded pockets of safety is to drive an ambulance that can trickle heal those sitting inside it. It’s a really coherent meshing of environment, situation, and equipment design.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of if the mission requires one or not, vehicles are as significant to Toxic Commando as its zombies and guns. The spaced-out objectives and open nature of the maps mean you’ll need some wheels to effectively cover ground, especially as that ground is so often practically carpeted by the undead. Cars like the armoured Maverick are good for both protection and doubling as a battering ram – you’ll just need to occasionally deal with the zombies who clamber aboard like particularly diseased monkeys at the safari. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All vehicles have a special ability, such as the ambulance’s healing aura or the Thunder pick-up’s flamethrower, but it's the winch attached to all but the family sedans that really makes a difference. Essentially a grapple hook that can be fired into a variety of anchor points, it can be used to rip gates off their hinges, bust open treasure containers, and pull your vehicle up slippy inclines. See, the Sludge God, in his infinite sticky wisdom, has covered each map in great big stretches of gloop, and so without a MudRunner-lite approach you’ll be spinning tires and going nowhere. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s admittedly very little new or experimental in Toxic Commando, but what’s here is genuinely good fun. It’s a more open take on Left 4 Dead’s horde-filled adventures, fuelled by the same “arcane evil” feel that’s made Call of Duty’s zombie mode feel so aesthetically solid. There are some issues that threaten that fun, though. Every mission I played felt like it had had the wind kicked out of it by the final stretch thanks to dwindling resources. Health kits are in short supply, ammunition can get a little tricky, and spare parts - a currency that unlocks special weapons and defensive structures – can only be found in a limited number of loot caches. By the end of a mission it can feel like the odds are really against you, and while I appreciate the need to ratchet tension and create a challenge spike in the final objective, in a game where zombies arrive by the truckful, restocking ammo only to find you’ve been given a single magazine does feel a bit unbalanced. I was having a lot more fun during the earlier minutes, when bullets were plentiful and the blood spilled like wine, so I’m not sure if the flow and tone really mesh with the current resource levels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more concerning thing, though, is progression. All weapons have individual XP bars, and must be levelled up to particular milestones to unlock different modifications. When you unlock a mod, you then need to spend a currency to actually fit it to the weapon, and each one costs several thousand. I can’t help but look at the entire armoury and envision the hundreds and hundreds of hours I’d need to sink into Toxic Commando to achieve a decently functioning, varied loadout. It’s the sort of system that funnels you into picking a single favourite, rather than encouraging you to constantly switch between missions. This, combined with a trio of different currencies and palette-swap character skins, has me a little suspicious that the sludge of live-service has tainted something I’ve otherwise had a pretty good blast with. But these grindy woes can also be found in Saber’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and they didn’t stop it from being one of my favourite games of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say I’m expecting John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando to have anywhere near the same impact Space Marine had. But, provided the full game has a solid range of missions that genuinely prove replayable, I do think the strong shooting and entertaining enemies have a decent enough chance to secure it a home among friendship groups who’d happily re-watch gloopy ‘80s horror over and over until the VHS wears out. Whether they’ll ever unlock the attachments they want for their favourite weapons… well, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Nearly 25 years from its initial release on the Nintendo Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. Melee continues to be one of the most popular games in the platform fighting franchise, particularly in the modding community. One modder, Mooshies, decided to add one of gaming's newest icons to the battle: Jimbo from Balatro.</p><p dir="ltr">The jolly jester's Smash Bros. Melee variant is a reskin of Mr. Game and Watch, with all of the movements and attacks of Mr. G+W intact. However, Mooshies's mod replaces all of the original character's weapons and sound effects with cards, images, and sounds from the 2024 smash hit roguelike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QjT-WGHvoM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9QjT-WGHvoM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mooshies released a brief gameplay trailer showing Jimbo in action, along with the wild and wacky way he uses the recognizable jokers and card packs from Balatro in matches against Falco, Marth, and more. This was originally released as a paid mod, but Melee players interested in trying Jimbo out can find the mod on <a href="http://patreon.com/Mooshies" rel="nofollow ">Mooshies's Patreon page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Super Smash Bros. community has been bereft of new content across the entire series since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's final update in 2021, which saw Sora from Kingdom Hearts join the roster as the final downloadable fighter in SSBU's Fighter Pack 2. Other downloadable fighters added to Smash Bros. Ultimate as DLC include Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII, Steve and Alex from Minecraft, and Kazuya from Tekken.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Super Smash Bros. may be dormant, its creator, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, has been keeping busy. His next project, Kirby Air Riders, launches November 20 on Nintendo Switch 2, and it was the focus of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/">45-minute Nintendo Direct</a> earlier this month.</p>
