            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m just starting Chapter 3 of <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s story mode, but I already want to start the whole game over. It’s the curse of city-builders, or at least when I play them: learning more as you go and realizing how much better things could be if only you’d done something different further back, realizing the ways you’ve hamstrung your little civilization by building on shoddy foundations. But I’m too attached to my version of New London–all its demanding people, and its struggling satellite towns, and the direction my whole society is moving in– to turn back now.</p><p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> comes out Friday for PC, and<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1835831410138996963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> later</a> for consoles, but people who preordered can play it today. It’s a sequel to 11 bit studio’s 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-be-playing-the-brutal-city-builder-frostpunk-1825656934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wintery, steampunk city-builder</a>, where you created a circular city around a vital, heat-giving generator, and then dealt with all your tiny citizens being pissed off at everything you did afterwards. The sequel does away with the circle and the clustered city, leaning into a hex-based sprawl that extends into the iced-over wastelands outside your city too.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWlLOpqIYjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While I miss the spatial constraints of the first game, I appreciate what <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is doing with its new shape. It feels like it wants to be a <em>bigger </em>game in every way, asking you to think about civilization as a whole. In terms of city planning, you first have to “frostbreak” a required number of hexes before you can build on them, and then instead of constructing buildings you construct entire districts. These districts have specific functions: extracting necessary items like materials, food, coal, or oil; industrial areas that can produce goods, needed to keep people happy and crime down, or prefabs, which are required for building; housing for your rapidly growing population; or logistics areas that create scouts to explore the snowy frostlands beyond. I found frostbreaking a little annoying, feeling like an extra step and cost, but it embodies the vibe of <em>effort</em> that defines the game. The snow isn’t just for aesthetics here; <em>of course</em> you’d have to break the ice before you could build.</p><p>This grander physical scale also means a more zoomed-out, complicated experience. Time moves in weeks instead of days, and districts require huge amounts of workers to function, requiring massive populations that come with the downside of requiring more resources. Things feel less intimate than in the first game, and while individual citizens still pop up with stories to tell and requests to make, I found myself thinking about them more as numbers, like any other resource. Instead of managing a little city, you’re managing an entire civilization, and the unique people within it started to fade into the back of my brain in favor of focusing on my need for more space and more resources.</p><figure><figcaption>An overlay of the different districts. (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>Your local resources will eventually run out, requiring expanding into the outlying areas, setting up new mini-civilizations and connecting them to your main city via trails or higher-capacity skyways. In the story mode’s prologue, you have to get a generator in an old train up and running; later in the story, you return to create a colony that can extract oil to send back to your main city of New London. I did<em> terribly</em> by these isolated, necessary colonists, putting them on extra shifts pumping oil and then shipping all of it away to heat my main city and provide resources for other outposts or settlements. (There are three different names for the outlying areas you can set up; suffice it to say they have different levels of management required, and are differently affected by weather events.) When workers died during emergency shifts, I just sent more workers, creating housing and food shortages. At one point, a group of nomads demanded the colony stockpile oil for them, but I just kept sending that oil away because the city needed it more, leading to a slaughter that at least solved my resource shortages. When a whiteout weather event set in, interrupting the flow of resources and creating a crisis in New London, I basically abandoned the little oil colony completely to focus on the city. I returned to just a handful of survivors, and am now faced with getting the whole thing back up and running on top of my guilt.</p><p>In one way, I really like this mechanic: juggling so many moving pieces and competing needs, zooming in and out to make sure my whole system is working. In another way, it felt a little busy at times. I had to fiddle with a lot of moving resources around to supply or upgrade areas: my oil colony had its own economy, but to get needed oil to my food-producing settlement, I had to send it from the colony to the city first, and this is just one minor example of all the resource moving and balancing and stockpiling the game requires. It all feels engagingly hands-on, but also a little bit complicated for the sake of being complicated. Whether this is a good or bad thing is down to your personal tastes, but I admire that the sequel is more than just a rehash. It stays true to the original’s focus on balancing competing demands, but expands that out into every aspect of the game in a way that gives you both more demands to balance and more control over how you do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is, of course, still a focus on people, one of the notable qualities of the first game. Here, there’s a whole council to wrangle with, full of communities and factions with their own worldviews, goals, and opinions on your leadership. You’ll need to get enough of them on your side to pass the laws you want to pass and shape your city to your whims. Early on, my delinquent youth were causing crime; my options were to institute mandatory schooling, supported by the forward-thinking Evolvers faction, or mandatory apprenticeships, supported by the traditionalist Faithkeeper faction. Each of these groups had their minds made up, which left my two communities, the New Londoners and Frostlanders, somewhere in the middle. (As with the outlying areas above, there are different kinds of groups of people: factions arise from communities and have more opinions, and will hold rallies or take aggressive actions on their own.) To sway those undecided delegates to my choice, I could promise them things: offering to build the Frostlanders a survivalist headquarters (makes them happy; decreases my exploration time), or pass a law about machine-centric work shifts that would please the New Londoners (making districts require less workers; increasing squalor and thus wear on my districts). Or, I could avoid negotiating altogether by just holding the vote and seeing how things panned out.</p><figure><figcaption>The council chambers (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>The council feature’s bigger, more complicated take on the first game’s moral choices is a lot of fun, asking you to balance your goals with the demands of different groups of people and do a certain bit of manipulating to get what you want. You can fail your promises, accidentally or on purpose, turning groups against you and sowing distrust, too much of which will end your game. You can also micromanage these relationships a great deal, giving or taking money from groups, letting them choose what laws you vote on, or letting them take special actions. Factions and communities give your civilization a grand, messy personality that I felt like part of more than its commander; when I started, I wanted to side with the Faithkeepers, but the city kept going in the direction of the Evolvers because they kept bringing me useful demands and innovations. Where I sometimes didn’t love how many new pieces the expanded city-building has, I was delighted by all of the politicking and voting and micromanaging of the human side of things, down to the lovely council chambers graphic and all its mumbling, cheering members.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll notice all the little distinctions and explanations I bracketed out above, like the differences between factions and communities, or outposts, settlements, and colonies. <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s bigger scale introduces what I found to be sometimes too much complexity, especially in my first time through the game. There’s a hefty text tutorial that, while helpful as a constant reference, didn’t always feel like it was introduced to me at the right time. I should be very clear that some of this is surely down to my own lifelong struggle to be patient during tutorials, and that the onboarding might have changed by the game’s final release. You’ll also benefit from guides and videos; in a couple instances where I watched people’s playthroughs of the game’s open beta, things were much easier for me to understand when I saw them in action. Some of my confusion might also be down to the game’s new perspective: a bigger city and more things to manage makes it easier to lose track of certain specifics, and while the game does a good job of using icons to show you where something’s gone wrong, it can take a bit of poking in tooltips and submenus to understand exactly why, and sometimes tweaks to your whole system to fix. Combined with a whole new lexicon and every building action’s various resource requirements (I haven’t even touched on the money-like heatstamps and how you get them, or the findable cores required for certain upgrades, or the research tree), <em>Frostpunk 2</em> has <em>a lot</em> going on. Sometimes this felt like it made my experience better, but other times it felt like it just made my experience <em>more</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>A tooltip showing the resources of a certain kind of hub, which gives a glimpse of the things you'll juggle in the game. (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>While the story mode’s fail states don’t make it a great learning environment in some ways, it does help you figure out how to deal with and prioritize the things you’ll face in its open game mode. Moments of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed were balanced by learning more about why the game’s many pieces mattered as I clumsily banged them together and saw what the outcomes were. The more I played, the more I could see the possibilities behind the things that confused or overwhelmed me on their first introduction. Like many city-builders, and like the first game, it feels like one where you’ll want to embrace failure as a learning experience, and where mastering what it’s doing will give you a ton of control to experiment and roleplay. I’m excited to improve at it, and to learn from and be inspired by what other players do. I am bravely resisting the urge to nuke my starter city because I’m not the player–or city leader–I was when I started; this sense of growing control feels like I’m improving as a leader alongside my civilization’s improvements.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> isn’t just more <em>Frostpunk</em>, something I would have been happy with. It’s bigger and more complicated and more demanding and more personalizable in every aspect, all while staying true to the heart and ethos of the first game. That’s no small feat, and it’s exciting to see in a sequel. It's a game that knows what it wants to talk about and what it wants you to play with. Even when I felt like I had way too much to do, the way any beleaguered city leader might, I was excited to come back for more.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This looks good.” That isn’t an understatement, as the art behind this delightful, multi-dimensional <em>Zelda</em>-like sure is gorgeous and nostalgic. Developer All Possible Futures clearly put a lot of time and effort into creating a stunning aesthetic for their game, which releases on September 17 and has players jumping between 2D and 3D environments as a—you guessed it—plucky squire.<br></p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>The Plucky Squire:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-plucky-squire%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-plucky-squire%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> </p><p>The 2D environments are the most dazzling to behold, as they embrace the storybook world in which most of the game’s characters live. This half of the game’s visual style is defined by an impeccable use of color and simple yet evocative bold lines enveloping every item on the page.<br></p><p>That isn’t to say the 3D world in which protagonist Jot gets jettisoned into early on in <em>The Plucky Squire </em>isn’t equally as impressive, it’s just not what you expect when you start up the game. Yet once you and Jot both get into the world outside of the storybook, the effortless translation of 2D designs to 3D speaks to just how well crafted every piece of this delightful adventure is.<br></p><p>In the final version of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>, all of this varied artistic splendor seems natural, effortless even. But it took a lot of work from All Possible Futures to get to that point. From the initial idea and very first drawings to the game’s final designs, these pieces of concept art show the process of how <em>The Plucky Squire</em> became what it is.</p></div></div><div><figure

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-g%E2%80%99s-new-pro-series-accessories-will-excite-esports-players.983631/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-esports-pro-series-accessories/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Logitech has just revealed the next generation of Pro Series mice and keyboards during Logi Play 2024, a tech showcase highlighting the future of Logitech G. Marketed towards ‘elite esports athletes’, the new Pro Series accessories are set to turn heads after being designed hand-in-hand with professional gamers and esports experts alike.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-competitive-lineup">Competitive Lineup</h2>



<p>Logitech has revealed three core components to the Pro Series range at Logi Play 2024:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pro 2 Lightspeed Wireless Mouse (RRP $129.99)</li>



<li>Pro X Superlight 2 DEX (RRP $159.99)</li>



<li>Pro X TKL Rapid Keyboard (RRP $169.99)</li>
</ul>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 DEX is a brand-new, asymmetrical mouse that boasts a right-handed design. It has been assembled with help from Counter-Strike and Valorant pro players, and with it being light, wireless, and responsive, it’s a solid choice for esports gamers. </p>



<p>G2 Esports’ NiKo spoke about this new mouse:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 DEX feels like an extension of my hand, and that kind of comfort is crucial in high-stakes matches. DEX delivers on the quality, precision, and speed that I told Logitech I need to win.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, the Logitech Pro 2 Lightspeed Wireless mouse offers an ambidextrous build that takes the original model to the next level. This new build was praised by FlyQuest RED’s ‘evv’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you are a fan of ambidextrous mice, the G PRO 2 LIGHTSPEED is definitely the one I recommend! It’s such a fast and<br>responsive mouse, and its shape is effortless to hold, which makes adjusting to your targets more precise and simple.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The gem of the bundle has to be the Pro X TKL Rapid keyboard, though. This is Logitech’s entry into the magnetic analogue market, and it features adjustable actuation and rapid trigger functionality as standard. That means players can tweak the keys to their liking – without software. That’s a <strong>huge </strong>win for esports players.</p>



<p>In a statement, G2 Esports’ m0NESY, one of the best Counter-Strike players in the world, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve tested many analogue keyboards out there, but what sets the PRO X TKL RAPID apart is how Logitech truly listened to my input. They took the time to understand what I needed in a keyboard and made sure those features were reflected in the final product.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In terms of release dates, both the Pro 2 Lightspeed and the Pro X Superlight 2 DEX are available now, while the Pro X TKL Rapid keyboard will be released in December. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has announced to all of its employees a new in-office mandate requiring staff be in office at least three days a week. The announcement came via a company-wide email from from chief studios and portfolio officer  Marie-Sophie de Waubert.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/ubisoft-will-return-to-3-days-a-week-in-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, who received a copy of the email, the company is requiring the three days in office in order to “enhance creativity and teamwork.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft says that a third of the global staff already work three days in office. This policy now makes it a company-wide mandate. Of course, there will be some exceptions depending on where the employees live as well as whether people will be forced to move closer to an office during a time when housing prices continue to be higher than at any point in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-ubisoft-said-to-employees">What Ubisoft Said To Employees</h2>



<p>“We are a creative company, and creativity is boosted by in-person interactions, informal conversations, and collaborating around the same table,” de Waubert said in her email to Ubisoft’s employees. “Being together in person also helps&nbsp;solve problems and make decisions more effectively.&nbsp;Increasing in-person time is key to learn from each other in an industry that’s constantly evolving. And this is even more important for newcomers who need to master our tools and understand our ways of doing things.”</p>



<p>Though there is a return to three days in office, Ubisoft says that it will not be going back to a full five-day week. VentureBeat does mention that companies like Amazon, Dell, AT&amp;T, and others have all forced employees back into the office in recent months.</p>



<p>There is no set date for when the mandate will go into effect.</p>

Normally, games get announced and then we don’t hear about them or see anything until it’s either canceled or nearly done. This time around, EA is being very open and transparent with the process and letting fans see (and play) very early versions of the <em>Skate </em>reboot. It’s a refreshing change of pace in an overly secretive industry. </p><p><em>Skate </em>is set to arrive next year via Early Access. Hopefully, it will be worth the wait. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To clarify on the decision, EA vice president and The Sims general manager Kate Gorman <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to Variety</a>, “The way to think about it is, historically, ‘The Sims’ franchise started with ‘Sims 1’ and then ‘Sims 2,’ ‘3’ and ‘4.’ And they were seen as replacements for the previous products.</p>



<p>“What we’re really working with our community on is this a new era of ‘The Sims.’ We are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we’re only going to be adding to our universe.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future-of-the-sims-from-ea">The Future Of The Sims From EA</h2>



<p>Moving forward, EA will treat The Sims as a universal franchise across multiple platforms in the form of different product, including games and movies.</p>



<p>When asked for further clarification on the state of the franchise, Gorman added: “What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a ‘5’ — but it doesn’t mean that we’re going to start you over, reset all your progress, and really feel like you’re going to lose all of that amazing play you put into ‘4′.”</p>



<p>Future updates on the game will continue to come “regularly every two months until further notice”. The next known update is coming this week to The Sims 4 that will include fixes and a base game update. Full patch notes on it will be available when the release drop. </p>



<p>There will also be more expansions to the game for players that add to the game.</p>



<p>What do you think of The Sims 5 no longer happening with EA set to just focus on the franchise as a whole? Let us know in the comments below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-review.983562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Most sequels to successful games are safe, conservative iterations on the ideas of the original, but not here: Frostpunk 2 is a bold follow-up that takes an almost entirely different approach to its city-building strategy. It’s set in the same bleak, iced-over world where people struggle to survive, but it’s refreshing that we’re not retreading the same frozen ground. Everything from how you place buildings to how you manage resources and heat your city is a new spin, and its political system is a creative way to interact with the people of New London that does a great job of conveying a sense of <em>quid-pro-quo</em> negotiation in a representative democracy. The zoomed-out perspective does mean that we lose a lot of the feeling of intimacy that made the first game truly stand out, but there’s no shortage of morally questionable decisions to make as you’re building your society. </p><p>A frosty atmosphere is strong, thanks to bone-chilling weather effects and dramatic music that swells as tension in your city increases. Coming from a replay of the first Frostpunk, I was initially missing the ability to see people walking in the streets. That said, they do pop up with comments on your actions and an announcer on the loudspeaker gives occasionally amusing remarks on current events, so it doesn’t feel like a ghost town. The map itself is obviously fairly uniform because it’s covered in white snow and ice, but there are features like mountains and cliffs to give each area its own look, and as you build it becomes much more colorful thanks to intricate districts and the automatically created power lines which pulse red when tension runs high.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Frostpunk 2 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The five-chapter Story mode serves as something of a tutorial for the sandbox Utopia Builder mode, though aside from a few short cutscenes there isn’t a whole lot of plot driving it. There’s little here beyond a direct bridge between the events of the first game and this one as you take over the city of New London, with the vast majority of story coming in brief, affecting vignettes about life in the frozen wastes. There’s a lot to cover as you learn to place and expand multi-tile districts for housing, food production, resource/fuel extraction, industry, and logistics, each with its own set of upgrade buildings, plus single-tile hub buildings with adjacency bonuses. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s an interesting city-building puzzle with a couple of questionable quirks.</p></div><p>It’s an interesting city-building puzzle with a couple of questionable quirks: The frostbreaking system, which requires you to first clear out batches of tiles before you can build on them, makes sense in the fiction but feels like busywork that just slows down how quickly you can act on a plan. It’s also frustrating that you can’t reposition any single tile without demolishing the entire district and starting over, but at least you get all of your resources back so all it costs you is time.</p><p>When you zoom out to the vast and even more barren Frostlands map, the main features are the very Game of Thrones-inspired clockwork icons for your colony and outposts. Your scouts discover these as you send them on dispatch missions to explore and bring home many of the resources and population you’ll need to keep your colony going. It’s much more built out than the original’s version of the Frostlands, in that you must connect the resources you find there with roads to bring back a steady stream of them, then found and upgrade more outposts and even full satellite colonies to keep New London going. It’s very much a side activity, but the rewards there are so crucial to building your population that I was motivated to check it frequently and keep the resources coming. </p><p>The main thing that bothered me here is that you can’t see your factions at the bottom of the screen when you’re not in your main city, so if things start going wrong as you’re off building your resource operation it can get out of hand before you notice. I’d also have loved to be able to zoom out further, since the Frostland maps can get huge and scanning for where my scouts just finished a mission takes too long.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can’t just produce enough to keep the lights on – you need to overproduce as hard as you can.</p></div><p>The challenge of feeding your colonies’ central generator’s need for fuel and keeping the city supplied with heat, food, and materials is fairly conventional and straightforward for supply chain games, though in a few major ways it does become more complicated at times. For one thing, massive Whiteout storms hit every so often and shut down the entire Frostlands map, disrupting supply chains and leaving you to subsist on your stockpiles for months at a time. That means you can’t just produce enough to keep the lights on – you need to overproduce as hard as you can to avoid having your people freeze to death by the hundreds.</p><p>Speaking of freezing, I did hit a couple of bugs with the interface, such as where I had to click on certain dialogue choices a bunch of times before they’d register. Sometimes the buttons on the UI would overlap and clicking it would register on the button underneath instead of the one that was more visible on top. It’s also a little annoying that it locks up for several seconds during an autosave, but there was nothing severe. It's worth noting though, that – as with most games of this type – the higher your population goes, the more performance is prone to decline.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The centerpieces of Frostpunk 2 are its faction and government systems.</p></div><p>Arguably the centerpieces of Frostpunk 2, though, are its faction and government systems. This is where you must strike a balance between opposing groups of citizens by keeping promises around how they’d like to see you run the place. You don’t lose by having your colony wiped out (it would be quite a challenge to get the population down to zero) – instead, you have to worry about your people losing trust in you or the tension level rising to the point where they boot you out of office. It’s all too easy for a shortage of any of the resources to send you into a downward spiral where everybody’s mad at everybody else and society collapses. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dan's Favorite Building Games</h3></p></div><p>My first time through I made the rookie mistake of assuming I could blow off one faction entirely if I kept the others happy, and at first it seemed to work. You can research whatever technologies you like with the push of a button (and a small fee) but passing laws – often needed to actually enact what you’ve unlocked through research – can only be done through the Council, which is made of 100 representatives of your city’s factions. Frostpunk 2 has a fun way of displaying the votes, where members’ seats light up as they cast theirs, and any vote you don’t lock down in advance is a roll of the dice. Bribing – or rather persuading – a faction to vote your way is a matter of making promises to do something on their behalf. Most of the time they want you to research a specific tech or pass a law that aligns with that faction’s worldview, but sometimes they’ll take cold, hard cash (ironically called heatstamps). Even so, factions won’t negotiate at all if a proposal is against their worldview, so some votes are still nailbiters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My first time through I made the rookie mistake of assuming I could blow off one faction entirely.</p></div><p>I had a lot of fun with the fact that, if you play your cards right, you can often be rewarded for doing what you’re planning on doing anyway. The interface helpfully tells you which version of each research item (most have different options that might, for instance, cost less to build and boost production but pollute more or create tension) is supported by which faction. Armed with that information, you can go to them and see if they’ll ask you for it, and if they do you’ll build extra trust when you research it. Similarly, it’s always hilarious to promise a bothersome faction they get to choose the next law that’ll be voted on in order to get their relationship bar out of the red, only to then whip votes against it and see them get nothing out of it.</p><p>So I could usually pass any law I wanted with a supermajority of support, ignoring the extremists who were upset when I pushed through policies like Free Essentials to feed the people or Accept All Outsiders to boost my population, whether they could work or not (hitting population numbers is one of the main goals). However, there’s a catch: until you unlock some of the heavier-handed and authoritarian policies, that approach leaves you vulnerable to protests that shut down production in your districts, injure bystanders and destroy equipment, and of course raise tension through the roof. That means you’ll have to come back to the table and negotiate, which can be difficult to do while riots are slowing everything to a crawl. You do get more tools to deal with dissenters as you go, up to and including rounding them up and leaving them to freeze to death in outdoor prisons (I eventually won the story campaign by finally deporting the troublemaking faction to their own colony) but many of those cause tension to rise and trust to fall when used. There’s no easy answer, which makes it a compelling problem to solve. </p><p>My first run of the Story mode took about 15 hours, including a restart when I figured out exactly how bad my initial decisions had been. I’ve since put in another 20 in the Utopia Builder sandbox mode with objectives like founding multiple colonies with 10,000 residents or building tall with 50,000 in your home base, and there’s a promising amount of replay potential in Frostpunk 2. Not only are there six major factions (and their radicalized offshoots) to mix and match – and seven different Frostlands maps to play on – but there are different paths you can take by leaning into different philosophies that unlock different radical ideas. Doing a run on a higher difficulty than Officer – the one recommended for Frostpunk veterans – would certainly require spending more time getting to know the factions’ preferences than I did on my first successful run to avoid angering them unnecessarily. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s a promising amount of replay potential in Frostpunk 2.</p></div><p>I can’t help but feel that we’ve lost something important, though, in expanding from the small-scale perspective of the first game to a multi-colony big picture – one where you can only see your people when you hit a button to do a close-up to observe a handful of them milling around. For instance, seeing a message pop up that 93 children died in a mine collapse doesn’t really hit the same when it soon vanishes without obvious repercussions. It was a lot easier for me to think of those kids as just stats on a spreadsheet when they never even had names that I can view in the graveyard, like I could in Frostpunk. Frostpunk 2 is just too big for that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>“Back up a second,” you might say. “What were 93 children doing in a mine in the first place?” Well I’m glad you asked. In one of my smarter decisions as Steward of New London – one that was enabled by my choice to go with an apprenticeship system instead of mandatory schooling for children because it increased my workforce – I opted to send them in to gather coal that was inaccessible to full-grown adults. The other option was to blast the way clear, but that would’ve given me less coal. No one could’ve foreseen anything going wrong with that plan!</p><p>Forstpunk 2 is always throwing decisions like that at you and then serving up consequences, often making me feel a little dirty for picking the one that gave me the boost the spreadsheet said I needed despite the human cost. So while it might not land the punches as effectively, it certainly takes a lot of swings, and those add up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-plucky-squire-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>As a lifelong Zelda fan, I’m always hesitant when other developers set out to make a game so clearly inspired by Nintendo’s acclaimed action-adventure series. I find that the puzzle design never quite reaches Zelda’s incredibly lofty bar, and I’m usually left wishing I was just playing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/17/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d-review">Ocarina of Time</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/14/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-review">A Link Between Worlds</a> instead. But The Plucky Squire breaks that trend, with a combination of clever brain teasers, simple but effective swordplay, and a courageous silent protagonist that would feel right at home in Hyrule. The adventure is held back by an overly wordy script and some serious pacing issues in its final act, but this debut game from developer All Possible Futures is still a journey worth taking.</p><p>The Plucky Squire’s elevator pitch is brilliant: You play as Jot, the hero of a children’s book who learns early on that he is, in fact, just the hero of a children’s book. This leads to a surprisingly meta story where Jot leaps between the 2D pages of his picture book and the 3D real world around it, which is represented by the childhood bedroom of a young Plucky Squire superfan named Sam who collects all of Jot’s stories and merchandise. That unique premise paves the way for The Plucky Squire’s inspired puzzle design. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Plucky Squire Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While within the story’s beautifully animated depictions of beaches, villages, and mountaintops, Jot can manipulate the book’s text to alter his reality and get past obstacles. Need a closed gate to swing open? Jot can literally pick the word “Open” off the page from another sentence in the book and swap it into the prose lying in front of the shut gate. It plays out like a (substantially) lighter version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>’s rule manipulation, and it’s a blast to experiment with different combinations of nouns and adjectives to see how the world reacts, like turning a tiny frog into a giant frog for no reason other than wanting to see if it would work. (Spoilers: It did.) It’s not the <em>most </em>flexible system – each scenario with this concept only includes a handful of eligible words Jot can interchange – but it’s still a really impressive mechanic the developers use in several smart ways throughout the adventure. Through the power of language, I filled a drained moat with water, turned sturdy columns into crumbling ones in order to topple them onto an enemy blocking my path, and a whole lot more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Plucky Squire hits some awesome puzzle-solving highs.</p></div><p>Wordplay is just one smart way The Plucky Squire takes advantage of its storybook setting. Jot can also pop out of the book and turn from an adorable hand-drawn 2D character into a fully 3D version of himself that’s reminiscent of the toyetic look of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link’s Awakening remake</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-the-final-preview">Echoes of Wisdom</a>. When outside of the book, Jot can play God and directly manipulate the world within, with powers like tilting the book on its side to slide blocks around or even flipping back to an earlier page to grab a word or item that he needs on the current one. Backtracking through pages to find The Plucky Squire’s optional hidden collectibles also resulted in some cool “aha!” moments, and I could see myself going back to snag the ones I missed. The book’s myriad uses forced me to zoom out and think bigger about the tools at my disposal, and The Plucky Squire hits some awesome puzzle-solving highs within these segments.</p><p>The only issue is how many hints The Plucky Squire constantly throws at you. Before I was set loose on most puzzles, Jot’s endearing companions Violet, Thrash, and Moonbeard have a whole conversation about what you need to do. This inclusion is even more confusing when you take into account The Plucky Squire’s well-implemented optional hint system, where a recurring character that’s pretty much always around will tell you exactly what you need to do next if you ask for help. It’s frustrating that the developers lay out too much information through mandatory dialogue rather than leaving it to the hint system so experienced players can try to piece it all together without hand-holding.</p><p>In fact, chattiness is a problem throughout the entirety of The Plucky Squire. Characters are always stopping to have lengthy conversations about what to do next, and while it’s all well-written dialogue, I found myself wanting to mash through these extensive sequences to get back to the action. The incessant over-explanation of Jot’s mission to take down the evil Humgrump is one way The Plucky Squire feels aimed squarely at a younger audience, but the witty humor and lighthearted tone just barely save it from becoming a major drawback. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The outside world goes well beyond the pages as Jot explores Sam’s bedroom to find new abilities to interact with his book. These exploration sections are a wonderful change of pace from the puzzling nature of the storybook, and Sam’s bedroom is a delight to run around. Like you’d expect from a young boy’s room, toys and LEGO bricks are littered everywhere, and Jot platforms across playing cards and building blocks to find his next upgrade. In these sections, Jot can hop in and out of sticky notes and children’s drawings, which makes the whole thing feel like a creative take on A Link Between Worlds’ wall-merging mechanic. There are a few minor technical issues in the real world – I noticed some shadows flickering in and out and I had one hard crash – but for the most part The Plucky Squire looked and ran great on PlayStation 5.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s jarring when The Plucky Squire completely loses its stride in the final act.</p></div><p>Combat works the same whether Jot is in or out of the book. He can swing his sword, throw it at enemies like a boomerang, and make use of powerful jump attacks and spin attacks. These moves can all be upgraded at shops that pop up across the land of Mojo, where you spend currency that’s mostly found – fittingly – by cutting grass. The swordplay is simple, fun, and rarely challenging, but for a game mostly focused on puzzles, I don’t mind that the fights are basic bouts to rip through on your way to the next big riddle. </p><p>The Plucky Squire is also continuously working to shake things up. There are plenty of 2D platforming segments within the book’s pages, and sometimes the book turns vertically to give things a fresh perspective. But The Plucky Squire really flexes its creative muscles within the minigame segments that crop up regularly throughout Jot’s journey. There are homages to things like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mike-tysons-punch-out">Punch-Out!!</a>, rhythm games, shmups, and more that I won’t spoil here. Whether you’re uppercutting a honey badger or fighting off aliens while flying around inside a toy box, every minigame here is so charming and fun to play, and I loved seeing how the developers shook up the art style and character designs for each one. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Logan's Favorite Meta Stories</h3><p>I love when games break the fourth wall with clever storytelling. Here are my favorite examples of it.</p></div><p>With great pacing between the storybook, real world, and minigames for the first five hours of the roughly eight-hour campaign, it’s jarring when The Plucky Squire completely loses its stride in the final act. First, Jot loses all his abilities, and you’re forced to go through a very generic stealth section to recover all the powers you already spent the entire game gathering. It’d be like if Metroid ripped all of Samus’ upgrades away moments before the final boss and forced you to gather the Morph Ball and Grapple Beam a second time. What’s worse, this section takes place in an entirely monochrome world, sucking all the joy and color out of Sam’s bedroom and turning it into a dull trudge over tired ground. This section doesn’t take all too long, but it’s followed up with The Plucky Squire’s final dungeon, which is a repetitive march through samey rooms along with a rhythm stealth minigame I had to repeat three separate times. After facing a final boss that also goes on a phase too long, I was ready to be done before the credits even started rolling. It’s a shame, because The Plucky Squire is so delightful for most of its runtime, but that last third unfortunately leaves behind a sour aftertaste.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>At its heights, The Plucky Squire is a beautiful Zelda-inspired adventure filled with brilliant wordplay-packed puzzles. Jot’s ability to manipulate his own storybook from both the outside and within result in clever dimension-hopping mechanics and solutions that make each problem a joy to unpack. While genuinely funny at times, its wordy script often gets in the way of the action and occasionally spoils a puzzle’s solution before it even begins. It also drags in its drawn-out final act, as the adventure continues a couple hours after it’s already used up all its best ideas. But prior to that late stumble, The Plucky Squire is full of surprises, breaking up its puzzles with cute minigame homages to classic video game genres and fun sections that take Jot outside of the pages of his story. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Anybody who knows me knows I like my strategy and simulation games. Then again, if anybody has any memory of my nine years of writing reviews here at Wccftech (and before then), they'll also know my fondness of the genres - so much so that of the 303 reviews for this site, 103 of them sit firmly in strategy or Simulation. Others have a bit of a toe-in, too. I'm saying this here mainly to fill space because I've already previewed Frostpunk 2 twice, covering both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utopia Builder beta</a> and then getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-story-mode-hands-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on with the story mode</a> while in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Let's cut to the chase: if you liked Frostpunk, you will love Frostpunk 2. I liked Frostpunk quite a bit, and Frostpunk 2 is just Frostpunk but more, in every way that matters.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I've been able to play through and complete Frostpunk 2's five-chapter story and a game in the Utopia Builder mode, and there's a lot on offer, with a good amount of replayability on both. The story truly starts thirty years after the events of Frostpunk. It's still new London, but everything else from Tesla City to Winterholme to the dreadnought is the initial tutorial to smooth you into the new way of working.</p>
<p>Time hasn't been kind, but you can build bigger and better. I will skip the Dreadnought as I covered that in my story mode hands-on. The inner city is there when you get to New London, but it's time to spread out. Frostbreaking is where you send out huge machines to break the frost and open up new land to expand your city. On a large map, split into hexagonal pieces, you find access to different resources that, in the first game, will be what you barely touched upon when exploring.</p>
<p>Before we get to how you play, more on the story. As you progress through the campaign, you will be pushing New London from the original circle it was, finding a new fuel source, surviving a whiteout, spreading out and going to Winterholme from the first game, and eventually looking to hold off the downfall of what will now be a thriving metropolis. On your way, you will make decisions that will improve your standing with one or more factions. In the core story, the fervent ones are the Stalwarts and the Pilgrims.</p>
<p>At the end of it all, the ending line from Frostpunk's On The Edge DLC is the most persistent: "The ultimate threat was not the storm, but discord". Finding the balance between factions while trying to maintain resources is not easy. I would argue it's impossible if you wait too long - particularly on a harder difficulty setting. The journey is all worth it, even if the resulting text screens only explain how your decisions impacted the city and its people.</p>

<p>The last line is a clear link to the new Utopia Builder mode, which is endless. There is a target to achieve, but once that's achieved, you can continue until you want to stop or until the city falls. Here, you get to set up outposts using the population of your current city; you don't need to build in manually, and they are essential as they will give you resources from an unlimited pool. There are also other areas you can colonise and build other cities.</p>
<p>Of course, there's only so much you can do and survive; food is limited, and the longer you carry on, the longer over-population will create an impossible strain on what little there is. Win before you reach that point. All I can say from this is that each Utopia Builder mode, with the seven different starting points and various maps, will give you a different story. This story is exactly what Frostpunk 2 is all about, much like previous similar 11 Bit Studios games, and it does it fantastically.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Whichever mode you're in, the gameplay remains the same. As you expand further out, breaking the frost and building new districts - each district starts by using six hexes. Housing districts can be expanded twice, with all other districts once, and each expansion uses three additional hexes. As you expand, you can build an additional specialist structure; each is researched over time, and building them impacts your standing with different factions and the various metrics and resources your city runs on.</p>
<p>Heat, Squalor, Hunger and Disease. These are the things you will be balancing, and the worse they get, the more the tension in your city rises, particularly if the factions do not well think of you. The resources you're managing are one of the various fuel sources, be it Coal, Oil, or geothermal energy. Heatstamps are the world's currency, with fabrications, materials, goods, and food rounding it all out.</p>
<p>In addition, you will be directing political choices. In the first, you selected what happens. In Frostpunk 2, once you have built the council chamber, the factions - based on population - will have a portion of the 100 seats. You can select a law for a vote to happen or even offer the agenda to one of the factions and boost your popularity, which is interesting if you give them the agenda and don't want their vote to pass. It won't due to sheer numbers, so you get the bonus of making them happier while not having the law go through.</p>
<p>With these laws and the new layer of voting, you can find even more interest, and the factionalism of real politics comes through. If you want a vote to swing one way, you can make promises or, once researched, use some of your trust to swing people. Keep any promises, too, as you have time limits; not fulfilling them will set you back.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I haven't touched upon visuals and audio yet because there isn't much to say. Frostpunk already looked fantastic, and Frostpunk 2 does again. The districts are very detailed, letting you zoom in and see part of their workings, and the effects of the weather and surrounding areas are fantastic. Like the original, the audio is also extremely fitting, with the audio effects planting you firmly in the frozen wasteland and a soundtrack that never feels out of place. That's often the best praise I can give a game. I want the sound to immerse me, and it does.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is, like other titles by the same studio, a game about balance and perseverance and follows on from the original in a fantastically organic way. Once a city has reached its initial limits, it will naturally have to spread and use the resources around it. In such an inhospitable world, you will be forced to make difficult decisions and forge a path that will not suit everybody, and human nature and our inability to think beyond our narrow field inevitably leads to conflict, as we have seen ourselves - and continue to see - all too recently.</p>
<p>If you liked Frostpunk, you will love Frostpunk 2.</p>

<p>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a masochistic gamer chances are you were one of the many lovers of the dystopic hellscape that was <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="495fb51d-c7c2-4a71-b23d-5e91a7a2c1a6" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-review-testing-limits-of-human-conscience"><em>Frostpunk </em></a>when it was released in 2018. Now in 2024 <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is going to test your ability to juggle weather, resources, and the respect of your people. With grander ambitions and a slightly scaled-up viewpoint, how well does <em>Frostpunk 2</em> adapt while staying true to its frozen roots?</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> picks up the story 30 years after the events of the original game, the Captain has passed and so now the player takes up the mantle of the Steward whose job isn't just to survive the Frostlands but to expand humanity by seeking out new settlements.</p>
<p>Starting the game the first immediate change players will notice is that the level of scale is far higher than it was starting out in <em>Frostpunk</em>. You're no longer dealing with groups of 10-15 people, assigning them different facilities and tasks, but with groups of hundreds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-early-city.jpg?itok=YiF9mi4z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-early-city.jpg?itok=pQ2AfCLb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Start by reviewing the resources available to you and working on achieving the bare minimum</figcaption></figure><p>This increase in scale is persistent across everything. Whether it's the buildings you create, expeditions you send out into the world, or resources you gather all are on a larger scale.</p>
<p>A major change is that you can't see individual characters walking around, the downside is that it removes some of that personal touch, but a big positive for me is that I don't feel as bad knowing that individual people are dying. At a larger scale, it seems more 'video gamey'.</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> from the outset makes you understand that while you're still stuck in a hellish frozen landscape, that there's still a lot to be worried about but that it's not just about re-establishing society but an evolution.</p>
<h2>Watch Your Resources</h2>
<p>There is an overarching story to <em>Frostpunk </em>where you set up your bases and further the plight of humanity (while ensuring it doesn't collapse in on itself), but the core of the gameplay is in how well you balance your resources.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-resource-balancing.jpg?itok=-djqrnG6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-resource-balancing.jpg?itok=ifmC2G58 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trade resources between settlements so that everyone can survive</figcaption></figure><p>As your population grows and you want to be doing more exploring and developing you'll need to be managing your Heatstamps, a currency in-game, and raw materials like prefabs and cores. A larger population demands more of the city. You need to build housing districts, be able to feed them, and offer enough materials and goods that they aren't living a poor existence.</p>
<p>It's also not just the manpower and physical resources that you need to contend with as the very first law that gets passed is whether you're even worthy of running the place. You'll start with factions like the Stalwarts and Frostlanders but as your society grows you'll see new factions introducing themselves. There's absolutely no pleasing them all as you'll find yourself trying to balance what you can, even if some are left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Balancing resources is a tough game, especially in the beginning, there are more than a few decisions where you'll be forced into a choice knowing it's going to hinder production or resource gathering elsewhere. It feels like you're consistently panicking and just having to fix whatever leak of resources you can as soon as possible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-new-london.jpg?itok=vPsIh7NT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-new-london.jpg?itok=pcM_0ykT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It won't always be this hard... hopefully</figcaption></figure><p>Later on in my game, once I'd had a chance to really be building up resources, these dire decisions came less and less frequently. I did somewhat miss the stress of trying to figure out where my next important resource would come from, but I did get an immense sense of pride knowing that I was totally handling the frozen apocalypse.</p>
<p>You'll end up balancing the progress of laws, the progress of research, and the progress of exploring the Frostlands. One of the biggest learning curves for me playing was keeping track of all of the very subtle indicators around the screen. There's no large fanfare when you can vote again, nor a flashing indicator that the Frostland Teams have found something, it will be seen when you notice it.</p>
<h2>Exploring The Vast World of <em>Frostpunk 2</em></h2>
<p>Early on you'll craft Logistics Districts that let you go out into the world in search of new resources and other global events. You might come across events with other communities, resource deposits, or even new places to create settlements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-exploration.jpg?itok=eutUl9HH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-exploration.jpg?itok=is-mXl63 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Experience all kinds of events while exploring</figcaption></figure><p>Once I had expanded into my second settlement I was afraid that it was going to become a crazy game of balancing, trying to make sure I was paying enough attention to both, but once my second settlement became even slightly sustainable it continued to progress without issue.</p>
<h2>The Consequences Of Your Own Actions</h2>
<p>While the weather of the Story mode has a set path of events – when it will get colder, warmer, or when a Whiteout will occur – the biggest change you'll experience will be from the different factions of the city.</p>
<p>How you research new buildings, vote laws into place, and the steps you take to please or displease residents will constantly keep the way these factions see you fluctuating. Trying to keep everyone happy was also an incredibly stressful portion of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-factions.jpg?itok=Z-qrpLdS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-factions.jpg?itok=b5TGu52- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Factions can be bribed for better relations</figcaption></figure><p>These factions always ensured that there was more in play than just me selecting what research and laws I wanted to put in place myself, and that I might have had to create a law I wasn't a fan of if it meant that these other factions stayed in a place of liking me.</p>
<h2>Utopia Mode Lets You Play Again And Again</h2>
<p>Gameplay doesn't end with the conclusion of the story as <em>Frostpunk 2</em> has an 'endless' mode called Utopia.</p>
<p>There are 7 different locations for you to pick from each with their own sets of pros and cons to really test yourself. The Windswept Peaks might have a medium area, but resources and frostland are randomized, the Broken Shore gives access to forests and oil but not iron, the Crater is a large area with starting resources but limited Coal.</p>
<h2>Music Adds To Tension</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole experience, the background music did an incredible job accentuating the tension of the moment or triumphantly congratulating you as you made a new positive step towards a warmer future.</p>
<p>For the majority of the game, the music felt subdued, there but under the surface, when it did swell it was a big indicator that something was about to happen. Even if I was progressing through the game pretty positively, the soundtrack would constantly reinforce the stress that the city was experiencing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-council-meeting.jpg?itok=DLaX-3VS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-council-meeting.jpg?itok=OXzrXusT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vote in laws for better or worse</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Frostpunk 2</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I was very nervous coming into <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's not normally my kind of game and I was dreading the sheer number of resources needed to be balanced. While the first few hours were exactly that, stress and resource balancing, as I played and built up my city to my liking I really enjoyed my time.</p>
<p>By the middle of the game, as I was exploring all regions and working with a relatively happy city, I was really proud of my accomplishments. I had taken on each new mechanic and a wider scope of settlements throughout the frozen wasteland and wasn't just surviving but thriving.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to technical issues that feeling of riding high didn't last for very long as my final experience of the game wasn't one of great success or triumph but that I personally survived and reached the finishing line.</p>
<p>Fans of <em>Frostpunk </em>will likely enjoy <em>Frostpunk 2</em> as it takes familiar elements and builds upon them, showing narrative growth as well as mechanical challenges.</p>
