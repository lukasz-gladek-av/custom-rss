			<p>Sony has announced the latest lineup of games coming to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers</a> this May. The headliner is definitely Rockstar’s blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2, but some other solid additions, including Deceive Inc. and Stranded: Alien Dawn are also on the way. Meanwhile, Premium subscribers have some deep cuts coming, including snowboarding game 2Xtreme and a Worms pinball game I’ve never heard of.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra headliners for May</a>…</p>
<p><em><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2 </strong>(PS4)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Red Dead Redemption 2 may not be perfect, but its minor shortcomings are tiny blemishes on a stunningly beautiful face. In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of unforgettable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Deceive Inc.&nbsp; </strong>(PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>“Go undercover as the world’s greatest secret agents in this multiplayer game of social stealth and subterfuge. Disguise yourself as anyone to blend into the crowd, deploy high-tech gadgets to gain the upper hand, and extract the package before the competition takes it for themselves! No trick is too dirty when you work for Deceive Inc. Pick your play style with a roster of diverse agents, each with their own customizable weapon and skillset. From world-renowned burglars to up-and-coming espionage sensations, Deceive Inc. prides itself on being an equal-opportunity employer.”</em></p>
<p>Here are the other games available to PS Plus Extra subscribers this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Sims 4 City Living DLC </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Crime Boss: Rockay City </strong>(PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Settlers: New Allies </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Stranded: Alien Dawn </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cat Quest </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cat Quest II </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Watch Dogs </strong>(PS4)</em></li>

</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus – Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn’t changed. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore the games available via each tier and sign up here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-returns-to-playstation-plus-in-may-offerings.872163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157535/playstation-plus-may-catalog-red-dead-redemption-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2ZOLZ0">PlayStation Plus is Sony’s equivalent of Xbox’s Game Pass service, and games come and go from the catalog over time. While not every game is on the service, and some rotate out, it’s still an excellent way to play a selection of great games from the last decade. For instance, Rockstar’s epic cowboy saga <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> will soon be available on PlayStation Plus after a long absence, along with a handful of other intriguing titles.</p>
<p id="C3SH3n">The May lineup for PlayStation Plus’ game catalog (arriving May 21) includes <em>Red Dead</em>, as well as the spy vs spy royale<em> Deceive Inc.</em>, co-op crime heister <em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em>, adorable cat-themed classic RPGs <em>Cat Quest</em> and <em>Cat Quest 2</em>, and survival simulator <em>Stranded: Alien Dawn</em>. That’s a smorgasbord of well-received games that can be sampled, which is a nice perk of PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p id="ddPU8v"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has a long campaign, but one that’s well worth exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the van der Linde gang is a slow motion trainwreck, with their criminal camaraderie slowly cracking under the pressure of the encroaching civilization and law that comes with it. In addition, <em>Red Dead Online</em> is a fun cowboy sandbox with a much more light-hearted tone, and it comes as part of the package with <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (though it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333281/red-dead-online-2022-updates-content-expansion-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x">no longer being updated</a>).</p>
<p id="SGmWPb">When the PlayStation Plus content library is refreshed, players lose access to titles that have been removed from the service. So if you’re playing <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or another title set to be removed through PlayStation Plus, you have until May 21 to wrap up. There’s a section marked “last chance to play” under the Collections page on the PlayStation 5, or the Games Catalog page on the PlayStation 4. </p>

And for the first time in a decade, Ubisoft’s popular series is skipping the PS4 and Xbox One. </p><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195719,196880" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Let’s hop into our own Animus and return to the year 2012. That’s the year <em>Assassin’s Creed III </em>was released on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC. That game didn’t launch on PS4 because...there was no PS4. Next year, in 2013, <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> (aka the really good pirate one) launched in 2013 on those previously mentioned platforms, but also arrived on the then-new PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p>So it seems reasonable to think that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510"><em>ACIII</em></a></span> was the last time the franchise didn’t arrive on PS4 and Xbox One. But no, that’s incorrect! Weirdly, in 2014, we got two<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> games: <em>Unity</em> and <em>Rogue</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530"><em>Unity </em>infamously</a></span> launched with a ton of bugs on PS4 and Xbox One. But <em>Rogue </em>only arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360, a sort of final farewell to those aging platforms. </p><p>Since then, for the last decade now, every major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game has been released on PS4 and Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">Even last year’s fantastic <em>Mirage</em></a></span><em> </em>launched on PS4 and Xbox One, consoles that are now over 10 years old. </p><p>However, this streak ends this November with the launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, which is only being developed for PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and Mac. While I’m happy to see the franchise move on and expand beyond what was possible on those older platforms, it’s a bit sad to see the end of an era. </p><h2 id="h14621"><a id=""></a>The OG <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and <em>Shadows</em> have this in common</h2><p>And yes, before you yell at me online, I know that (almost) all the main <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games eventually ended up on PS4 via remasters and re-releases. I know! But oddly, that leads to one last fact: <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will soon be just one of two main entries in the franchise to not be playable on PS4. </p><p>The other one? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed">The very first <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game</a></span> released back in 2007. </p><p>The game that started it all has never been remastered, remade, or even ported to any platforms beyond PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. Technically, the 360 version is playable on Xbox One and Series consoles. But to this day, the only way to play it on a PlayStation console is to dust off your PS3, ignore the loud fan, and boot it up there. </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launches on November 15 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Mac, and Amazon’s Luna streaming service. (Don’t laugh, it’s a thing.) </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for those considering jumping in, <em>Warframe </em>can look pretty dense and unapproachable. In some ways that’s true, but in other ways it couldn’t be further from the truth.</p><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,196251,196395" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>If you’ve been considering joining <em>Warframe</em> for a while or have recently been drawn in thanks to the intriguing cyberpunk flavor (and Ben Starr voice acting) of upcoming expansion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nk6fzEETYI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nk6fzEETYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warframe 1999</em></a></span> (hi), we have a few tips to help you sift through the deluge of stuff <em>Warframe</em> dumps on you from the jump. This is based on my own experience getting started in just the past few months, so rest assured this advice isn’t coming from a seasoned vet who may miss the forest for the trees a bit.<br></p><p>So grab your favorite robot/ninja/frog-person and let’s get started. Well, I’ll help you with that part too.</p><h2 id="h24422"><a id=""></a>The stakes are refreshingly low</h2><figure id="" data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before anything else, it’s important to frame the experience appropriately so you don’t immediately drown. Free-to-play games can be pretty meta-heavy, and if you start reading about <em>Warframe</em> or even playing it blind, you may find that there’s way too much information coming from multiple angles all at once. If nothing else, take this from me here: you don’t need to give a shit about anything to enjoy <em>Warframe</em>.</p><p>The whole game is basically a series of missions in which you go out to a stage, beat the stuffing out of bad guys, pick up all the junk they vomit, then go home and make your robot ninja frog’s numbers go up. There isn’t really an important PVP element at all, and the ranking system is entirely tied to your personal progress. The best way to enjoy <em>Warframe</em> is to take your time and just do whatever looks interesting. The appeal is in doing cool video game stuff, and all the metrics and stats and other nonsense is secondary. If you gel with the basic combat mechanics, that’s the whole point!</p><h2 id="h24423"><a id=""></a>Which Warframe should you pick? How about weapons?</h2><figure id="" data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First things first, you gotta pick your freebies. There are tons of different Warframes and weapons to collect, which involves either lots of farming (do this) or spending real money (don’t do this). But as is the case with these kinds of games, you get some starting equipment for free.</p><p>You can pick one of three starting Warframes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mag</li><li>Volt</li><li>Excalibur</li></ul><p>I picked Excalibur, because it’s a generic sword man. Not lots of thinking involved with this one. Many players swear by Mag though, because it has easy-to-use abilities that will draw enemies right to you in clumps, stun them, and let you bonk them to death with little resistance.</p><p>Nobody really cares about Volt, apparently.</p><p>Weapons come in three categories: primary, secondary, and melee. You can choose between two options in each category.</p><p><strong>Primary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mk-1 Braton - assault rifle</li><li>Paris - bow</li></ul><p><strong>Secondary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lato - pistol</li><li>Kunai - uh, kunai</li></ul><p><strong>Melee</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Skana - sword</li><li>MK-1 Bo - staff</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to pick the assault rifle over the bow, unless you’re one of those bow sickos who thrived back in the 2010s when every FPS suddenly had one. The secondary weapon doesn’t make as much of an impact, but it’s worth noting the kunai are good for not tripping alarms if you care about being sneaky.</p><p>Finally, if you’re playing as Excalibur, it only makes sense to pick the sword. But otherwise the staff is really good, especially when it comes to hitting multiple targets with regular attacks. And if you’re Mag, using its powers to bunch enemies together and pull them in makes the staff an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="h24424"><a id=""></a>Fill out the Star Chart</h2><figure id="" data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The worst part of information overload in <em>Warframe </em>is simply not knowing what to do. A lot of different routes are open to you from the beginning, and it’s easy to get distracted with each new thing you unlock and get lost. Instead, try and put the blinders on and focus on simply playing all the stages in each planet. That’s the Star Chart, which is basically a map of all the planets you can visit with points of interest all over it.</p><p>As you fill in the Star Chart you’ll find, more or less, an organic path through the game. Paths to other planets are big milestones that double as barriers with specific requirements, but especially early on you’ll likely obtain what you need well before you clear all the levels. Try to hold off on actually leaving Earth if you’re feeling overwhelmed, and take each planet one at a time.</p><h2 id="h24425"><a id=""></a>Modding is The Thing, forever</h2><figure id="" data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest part of <em>Warframe</em>’s progression, and perhaps one of the most intimidating, is modding. As you play the game, you’ll earn these cards that fill up your modding inventory, and each one offers some kind of stat bump. You get mods for your Warframe and each weapon, and things like pets down the road. Try not to overthink this stuff at first, and simply equip what you have the capacity for as you go.</p><p>The effects of mods range from obvious (bumps to health, damage, armor, etc.) to more complex (status conditions, elemental damage/resistance, etc.). And as you dive in more, you’ll get to things like upgrading individual mods and upgrading your capacity so you can actually make space for upgraded mods. But this is the long game. Don’t get caught up in trying to maximize this part.<br></p><p>Most importantly, don’t sell mods for credits! Choose the other currency instead, which is explicitly for upgrading mods and is much harder to come by.</p><h2 id="h24426"><a id=""></a>Try the Duviri Paradox</h2><figure id="" data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Illustration<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want something a little more streamlined to ease you into <em>Warframe</em> from a gameplay perspective, you can try the Duviri Paradox. This is a separate mode that’s kind of roguelike-y, and has its own self-contained story and reward systems. It’s also one of several options to check out if you simply need a break from the regular grind!</p><h2 id="h24427"><a id=""></a>Lore comes later</h2><figure id="" data-id="3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-recommend-id="image://3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman in futuristic gear reclines against a motorcycle.

And when you jump into the game and are mostly met with a bunch of loot grinding and menus to drown in, the whiplash is understandable. The answer, as in other cases, is to stick it out a while because the story starts much later.</p><p>If you’re really curious but disappointed that things aren’t popping off right at the start, the unfortunate reality is that you’re playing a game that evolved over the course of a decade into what it is today. And you gotta get through the onboarding before you get to the stuff that came after <em>Warframe</em> became a big deal. So if you’re vibing with the combat and loot loop, your patience will be rewarded with more lore and storytelling moving to the foreground. But don’t stress yourself out trying to find it. The story will come to you as you keep playing and progressing.</p><h2 id="h24428"><a id=""></a>Keep the Wiki on standby</h2><figure id="" data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fandom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I tend to hate this advice, but I want to stress how unnecessary it is while you’re still getting your robo-froggy feet wet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Warframe wiki</a></span> is a tremendous community resource that will be your best source of information for anything going on under the hood. If you have questions about how something works, or some other minutia to optimize your build, hit the wiki. But until that point, don’t worry about it too much. Just know it’s there, waiting for you, when you need it.</p><p>Hopefully this helped! It’s admittedly easy to feel intimidated by <em>Warframe</em> at first, as fun as it looks. Heck, I tried two or three times and bounced off before the stars aligned and it clicked. Now I’m having a blast, and all it took was thinking about the approach a little differently. Remember, there’s no actual pressure to do everything and perfectly engage with the <em>Warframe</em> meta. This isn’t a competitive game by most accounts. Instead, pick stuff that looks cool and fits how you like to play action games, make your way through the story and decide what you think of the game on your own terms. It’s much less stressful that way. Before long you’ll be playing “Fashionframe” with all the other vets.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed by Ubisoft today, with a gorgeous trailer being released to showcase the next major iteration in the legendary series. It’s officially hitting the market on November 15, and the most die-hard of fans will be eagerly securing the best edition of the game possible. Ubisoft has gone above and beyond with the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Collector’s Edition – it’s one of the most ambitious bundles in franchise history.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-collector-s-edition-is-insane">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Collector’s Edition is Insane</h2>



<p>Ubisoft just lifted the lid on one of the cleanest and most valuable Collector’s Editions in the history of Assassin’s Creed. In November, players will be able to get their hands on this top-tier edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it costs a pretty penny – $239.99 to be precise.</p>



<p>But what does the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Collector’s Edition come with?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>At the centre of the bundle is an incredible 40cm statue of Naoe and Yasuke, the game’s protagonist duo. This hand-painted statue is the crown jewel of the Collector’s Edition, but it’s only the start in terms of the full package.</p>



<p>Alongside the statue sits an exclusive steelbook case, a collector’s artbook with stunning lithographic prints, a life-size katana ‘tsuba’ (hand guard) with a display stand, a gorgeous world map, and a ‘meticulously crafted’ Japanese wall scroll measuring 70x30cm. It all comes packaged in a box that’s a collector’s item in itself, and as standard, the edition comes with the Ultimate Edition of the game.</p>



<p>For a true fan, it’s well worth the expense. It’s arguably the biggest and boldest Collector’s Edition in series history.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">That doesn't appear to be the case with Season 4, which dramatically reworked the game's loot to make it more powerful, upgradable, and easier to acquire and customize than ever before. The result is praise on places like Reddit and "Mostly Positive" recent reviews on Steam, which was not the case for previous season launches.</p><p dir="ltr">"They did it, they fixed the game," user Frockyyy <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Frockyyy/recommended/2344520/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in their positive Steam review posted after the Season 4 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Many on Reddit seem to agree, with users praising the new season for its improvements to Helltides, which are now playable at lower World Tiers and much more lucrative, and how its various itemization updates have removed much of the inventory "hassle" that previously took up too much of Diablo 4 players' time. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs29tf/best_season_start_so_far_thanks_blizzard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's the "best season start so far" and is "Diablo 4 as it should have originally been released." Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs6tv4/diablo_4_is_so_much_better_now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> the game in Season 4 is "hardly recognizable" compared to launch, and that they are "having a lot more fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the positive reception may be the fact that Season 4 was the first Diablo 4 season to be extensively playtested by the community on the game's on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/" data-ref-id="1100-6522348">public test realm</a>, something that is used in other Blizzard games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a> but wasn't used for Diablo 4 in previous seasons. That feedback then made its way into Season 4 from the start as opposed to weeks later like in previous seasons. Despite the positive effect the PTR seems to have had, Blizzard stated in a recent interview with GameSpot that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">doesn't have concrete plans to do PTR testing for every future season</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That being said, players do have a few complaints. The first is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs999o/does_the_game_feel_way_easier_after_patch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some think the game is too easy</a> at lower levels post-Season 4 update. Others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1csidra/very_awesome_season_but_lets_make_temper_manuals/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointing out</a> that new Tempering recipes, used to add affixes to gear, can be easily missed once they drop on the ground and should be more visible. Another complaint is that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-community-warns-that-latest-patch-changed-how-item-salvaging-works/1100-6523489/" data-ref-id="1100-6523489">Salvage button now salvages all items</a>, including Legendaries and Uniques, which wasn't the case before. That means more than a few players have likely been burned and lost some powerful items before learning about the change.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the complaints, it does seem that Diablo 4's latest season is a major step forward. As Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1csjrc3/s4_feels_like_it_is_exactly_the_direction_this/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netsuko puts it</a>, "S4 feels like it is exactly the direction this game needs to be taken," and that it makes them "hopeful for the expansion."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time an entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-3-went-from-disastrous-launch-to-a-hell-of-a-good-time/1100-6503426/" data-ref-id="1100-6503426">Diablo franchise has seen a dramatic overhaul</a>. Diablo 3's launch was a disaster, plagued by technical issues and complaints about its real-money auction house. It would take years for player sentiment to turn around following major updates and the release of Diablo 3's first and only expansion, Reaper of Souls.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-coming-to-game-pass-on-march-28/1100-6521127/" data-ref-id="1100-6521127">Diablo 4 recently released on Game Pass.</a> It's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-coming-late-2024/1100-6518910/" data-ref-id="1100-6518910">Vessel of Hatred, is slated to release in late 2024</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone knows by now how problematic the year of <em>Lightfall</em> has been for <em>Destiny 2</em> and Bungie at large. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-look-at-the-biggest-destiny-2-lightfall-issues-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The DLC itself</a>, for sure, was an issue, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-season-of-the-wish-opinion-send-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final season of the year</a> was disappointing and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungies-recent-destiny-2-state-of-the-game-is-one-of-its-most-disastrous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mounting number of real-world concerns</a> didn’t stop coming. Until now, that is.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">I’m something of a <em>Destiny</em> expatriate, you see. For the years between <em>Forsaken</em> and <em>Lightfall</em>, Bungie’s seminal franchise was <em>the</em> go-to game for me, from the lore books to day one raiding, I was all over everything related to <em>Destiny </em>at large. It wasn’t perfect much of the time, it goes without saying, but releases such as <em>Witch Queen</em> and a solid raiding/endgame friend group meant there was always, <em>always</em> something good for us to engage with. And, so we did. Until we stopped.</p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m not saying that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-may-have-just-received-a-blow-it-cant-recover-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the questionable quality of <em>Lightfall</em> and its subsequent seasonal offerings</a> was what put many of us off, necessarily, but it sure didn’t help. My playgroup simply fell off the live-service wagon that <em>Destiny</em>‘s been dragging behind it forever now, and getting back onto it wasn’t an option. Around the time of this taking place, the <em>Destiny</em> community was up in arms over a variety of things:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-game-director-joe-blackburn-leaving-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Blackburn up and left Bungie early in 2024</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-enables-classic-pvp-mode-after-new-experiment-flunks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The PvP modes were in shambles</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-confirms-delay-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape-announces-new-content-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The <em>Final Shape</em> DLC was delayed</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">And that’s a very non-exhaustive list of issues that cropped up for <em>Destiny 2</em> on top of all the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-may-have-just-received-a-blow-it-cant-recover-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other, more serious problems</a> that it had been dragging along from the months prior. This is relevant because as I fell off the daily <em>Destiny </em>grind, so too did I stop checking in with the community, which became more and more unhappy with the state of the game as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-says-they-missed-the-mark-on-parts-of-destiny-2s-lightfall-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie encountered problems</a> all of its own. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-lays-off-staff-and-delays-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The subsequent layoffs</a> made things worse still, leading to an overall air of unease that became associated with <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-stage-is-set-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">The stage is set for Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="861" data-injectable="true">It was strange and impressive in equal parts, then, when I checked back in with <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s biggest subreddit following the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Into the Light</a></em>. This free DLC release marked a major push onward, as far as Bungie’s attempts to turn things back around go. And now, with <em>Into the Light</em> in tow, the actual events of the game and its balancing are the main topics once again, betraying a sense of normalcy. Something that you wouldn’t necessarily expect, considering what Bungie and <em>Destiny 2</em> have been going through since <em>Lightfall</em> came out.</p>
 <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">Just months ago, it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-bungie-trying-to-regain-ground-with-destiny-2-players-before-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtually unthinkable that Bungie would successfully turn things around for <em>Destiny 2</em></a> in such short order. Yet, here we are.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">To be perfectly fair, this doesn’t mean that <em>The Final Shape</em> will be selling gangbusters. I’d be hard-pressed to expect this DLC to perform as well as <em>Lightfall </em>did, though I’m almost positive it’ll be a fair bit better in the end. That’s because <em>Lightfall</em> enjoyed the windfall delivered by the amazing <em>Witch Queen</em> DLC, while <em>The Final Shape</em> is bound to rile up negative attention thanks to <em>Ligthfall</em>‘s failures.</p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Yet, the sense of excited normalcy is pervasive on the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/destinythegame subreddit</a>. The most popular topics as of mid-May discuss <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crqpvk/the_class_i_use_is_bad_at_everything_the_other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game balancing</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cs4jhi/thunderlord_is_a_2_phase_with_platinum_for_rhulk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Pantheon combat strategies</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crx5tw/new_titan_exotic_showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em> content</a>, and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cs5l3p/bungie_seriously_if_youre_going_to_put_cats_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game cats</a>. This is in no particular order, mind: just to give you a general sense of how things have settled down, now that we’re <em>less than a month</em> away from what is, in effect, the most important <em>Destiny</em> <em>2</em> DLC we’ve had yet.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-can-bungie-deliver-once-again" data-injectable="false">Can Bungie deliver, once again?</h2> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is due to release on June 4, and the simple fact of the matter is that <em>Destiny</em> fans do have a lot to be excited about. The sheer presence of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/we-now-know-all-of-destiny-2s-prismatic-subclass-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Prismatic subclass</a>, for one, is unprecedented on its own, to the point that it’s easy to forget what else we’re getting with the DLC. A whole new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darkness faction</a>? A reworked <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-the-power-system-is-changing-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power system</a>? The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">un-sunsetting of items</a> that were out of the rotation since <em>Beyond Light</em>?</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Honestly, it’s like someone’s taken the generalized community content wishlist for <em>Destiny 2</em> and went ham on it. This stuff is so interesting that it’s completely overshadowed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/most-destiny-2-into-the-light-will-sunset-with-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s propensity to sunset a fair chunk of <em>Into the Light</em></a> once <em>Final Shape</em> comes out, but that’s a story for some other day.</p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Back to the topic at hand, it was virtually unthinkable just months ago that the <em>Destiny</em> community would be back to its usual self ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>. Against all odds, though, Bungie succeeded in balancing things out, and if <em>The Final Shape</em> delivers out of the gate, it may well end up being just the type of thing this franchise needs to maintain its momentum.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">All of this is to say that, as it currently stands, things are looking nice and calm in the <em>Destiny</em> corner of the world. This isn’t a given that everything will be hunky-dory once <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out, naturally, but it does give us an idea that the community is ready for Bungie to deliver something that’s in line with the franchise’s pedigree.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">It’s still entirely possible that this extremely hyped-up DLC will flunk. Or, as was the case with <em>Lightfall</em>, that it’ll do well early on, only to fall apart under further scrutiny and a continuously unremarkable post-DLC content schedule. Remember: we’ve got absolutely no idea how <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s ‘Episodes’ will function. </p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="806" data-injectable="true">Bungie is making a deliberate delineation between Episodes and Seasons as they were up until now, and there is <em>potentially</em> a fair bit less content planned for 2024 and beyond. Remember: we’re only getting <em>three</em> Episodes during the year of <em>The Final Shape</em>, compared to the <em>Lightfall</em>‘s four Seasons. The Episodes’ act-based structure and content formatting may pan out, but we just don’t have enough information to go on.</p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">So Bungie is about to make a huge gamble with <em>The Final Shape</em>. The team’s done well over the past couple of months, which resulted in possibly the best pre-DLC situation they could’ve wished for. The community is extremely receptive as it now stands, too, and the stage is set. As for what comes next… we’ve got just a few short weeks to go before we find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-tabletop-rpg-announced-by-geekify<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For Millennials, the <em>Neopets</em> franchise is one drenched in nostalgia. The novelty virtual pet game let players adopt, customize, and interact with the titular creatures in an online virtual world. In celebration of the series' 25th anniversary, a <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is coming to store shelves.</p>
<h2>The <em>Neopets</em> <em>Tabletop RPG</em> Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG </em>is being developed by Geekify. This is the studio behind dedicated <em>Neopets</em> merchandise, including calendars, enamel pins, and keychains.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=s3iCeaZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=_e9ZqIwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Millennials, enjoy the nostalgia blast.</figcaption></figure><p>This tabletop adaptation has been in development for two years. The game will be a dice-driven, d20-based adventuring system. It will feature a class-less, feat-oriented skill system designed for accessibility for new players while scaling to advanced players.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be set within the series' unique setting of Neopia, showcasing the series' fun and goofy tone through game mechanics. Lastly, Geekify confirmed that several campaign modules are in development, starting with <em>The Fall of Faerieland</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets</em> craze started back in 1999. It was one of the earliest examples of a free-to-play experience. Players could earn two kinds of virtual currency, which could be spent on customizing their Neopet. One was earned in-game, and the other bought with real-world money. At its peak, the game sported more than 35 million players.</p>
<p>The series has changed hands across multiple platforms and publishers. In 2005, Neopets Inc. was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-21-fi-neopets21-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchased by Viacom</a> for $160 million. In 2014, Jumpstart Games purchased the property from Viacom. In 2017, Chinese company NetDragon purchased Jumpstart Games. The franchise seemingly died under this stewardship; the servers shut down June 2023.</p>
<p>Across this storied history, <em>Neopets</em> continued to grow and expand. It introduced unique characters, storylines, and more sophisticated customization options for their players. It also introduced some moments of embarrassment like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neopets-data-breach-leaks-your-childhood-account-information">data leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2023/03/22/remember-neopets-this-hong-kong-company-is-trying-to-revitalize-the-nostalgic-game-with-web3-technology/?sh=670cc60ce9ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NFT drama</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is part of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/03/neopets-plans-comeback-in-a-vastly-different-era-of-gaming.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a franchise revival</a>, courtesy of a management buyout by the aptly named World of Neopia.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekifyinc/neopets-official-tabletop-roleplaying-game-ttrpg">coming to Kickstarter May 31</a>.</p>

This emulator, from developer Henrik Rydgård, has been in development for more than a decade, and it’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">free to download</a> for the iPhone and iPad.</p><p>Rydgård <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/news/live-on-app-store/">says in a blog post</a> that the version approved this morning has some limitations versus previous builds of the app that were available through various exploits and <a href="https://suyogya.link/installing-sidestore-and-ppsspp-on-ios/">workarounds</a>. The biggest is that Apple doesn’t allow Just-in-Time recompilers that retranslate code for the OS and can lead to smoother performance. (It’s why we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137369/dolphinios-emulator-apple-app-store-jit">might never see</a> a GameCube / Wii emulator.) “Fortunately,” he writes, “iOS devices are generally fast enough” for almost all PSP games.</p><p>Besides that, Rydgård said iPad Magic Keyboard support had to be removed because “the old method was using an undocumented API” but that the feature will return. The emulator’s RetroAchievements feature is disabled, too. Rydgård didn’t explain why but says it’ll be back later “with a better login UI.” The same goes for Vulkan graphics API support, which he says will also come back, possibly with “a native Metal backend.”</p><p>I never owned Sony’s first handheld PSP, but I polled <em>Verge </em>staffers and was told <em>Valkyria Chronicles II</em>, <em>Patapon,</em> <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, </em>and <em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</em> are all excellent reasons to check out PPSSPP. <em>Lumines</em> deserves a mention, too. Most of those games were released on other consoles later, of course, but they do represent the kinds of experiences that were available on the system.</p><p>PPSSPP works on iOS 12 and up, iPadOS 12 and up, and can also be played on the Vision Pro. Though the app is free, Rydgård’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-gold-psp-emulator%2Fid6502287918">paid version</a> is coming soon for $4.99, he told <em>The Verge</em> via email. Assuming it’s like the $5 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dorg.ppsspp.ppssppgold%26hl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS">Android version</a>, it may not be functionally different from the free app — it’s there to support Rydgård’s efforts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His placeable shield was more flexible than Reinhardt or Orisa’s, and his primary rock-throwing weapon did can do damage and disrupt in equal measure. On top of this, his ultimate ability, Gravitic Flux, which lifts enemies within its radius off the ground, slams them down, and cuts their health by half its base health, is still one of the most powerful ones in the game. For some reason, with <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-season patch</a></span>, Blizzard decided that Sigma’s ultimate needed a huge buff. Naturally, it’s now very broken.</p><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,192616" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Gravitic Flux is an area-of-effect ability signified by a dark circle on the ground that appears as its cast. There’s a darker center within this circle, and before this patch, a character had to be in the circle’s line of sight to be caught in the telekinetic slam. This is why characters like Mei or Lifeweaver were able to counter this ultimate by building an Ice Wall or Tree of Life that blocked teammates from being caught in the attack. This new patch removes that requirement, so now, if you’re in the circle at all, Sigma is giving you uppies. However, as some players have discovered, taking out the line of sight requirement means it can work through walls, even if Sigma can’t see those enemies.</p><p>Blizzard explicitly notes that this change was made because there’s a lot of counterplay against the Gravitic Flux, so perhaps this was the intention. But now all I can think about is how Sigma’s suddenly made for stealthy plays. Is your enemy team sitting on the payload in Dorado? Go into one of the buildings surrounding it and cast Gravitic Flux just on the edge of the room. You’re bound to catch at least one of them by surprise. This shit’s busted.</p><p>The full patch notes for <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s mid-season update are as follows:</p><h4 id="h14595"><a id=""></a><strong>COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES</strong></h4><p><strong>Demotion Protection Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Demotion Protection modifier has been moved from below the Rank Progress bar into the bar itself to improve visibility when a player is in a Demotion Protection state.</li><li>When Demotion Protection occurs, you will not be told when your progress is below that skill division’s range. If you lose your Demotion match, the Skill Rank adjustment will show only the adjustment from that match, instead of the net total of that match and the adjustment of the previous match.</li></ul><p><strong>New - Pressure Competitive Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>This rank modifier appears for players who are at the far ends of the overall skill distribution.</li><li>For players who are very high ranked (like Champion), this modifier will show when you don’t earn as much progress from winning a match or drop more progress for losing a match.</li><li>For players who are very low ranked (like low Bronze), this modifier will show when you earn more progress for winning a match or drop less progress for losing a match.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: This new modifier was added to show how our highest and lowest-skill players are being pushed toward a more average Rank. Competitive Play already calculates this Modifier to your Skill Rank adjustment, but it wasn’t visible until now. Very high or very low-ranked players will see this Modifier after every match while they continue to maintain a Rank at the outer limits of the ranked spectrum. Climbing to the highest skill tiers like Grand Masters or Champions is not intended to be easy, and overcoming Pressure to reach the top is no longer a hidden challenge that players must face.</p><p><strong>Grouping Restrictions</strong></p><p>The Skill Tier legend was updated to show the changes to grouping restrictions that were applied in a previous update. The grouping restriction changes we applied are the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grand Master can now group within 3 divisions to be considered a narrow group.</li><li>Champion can now group within 1 division to be considered a narrow group.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: While the Season 10 changes to grouping up with friends have contributed to a large improvement in match quality for most players, we’re still looking to reduce queue times for players and groups, especially for higher ranks.</p><p><strong>MATCHMAKING UPDATES</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>When a player is currently on a loss streak, the matchmaker will try to avoid putting the player on a team that is statistically calculated to have a lower chance of winning.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: Loss streaks never feel good. Before each match, we make a prediction about which team will win the game, based on the information we have about the players on both teams. This is how modifiers such as Consolation, Reversal, Uphill Battle, and Expected give or take additional Rank Progress after each Competitive Play match. Since most matches will have a team that has a slightly higher chance of winning, placing a player on the team with the higher chance who is currently on a losing streak is aimed at helping them have a fair chance of breaking that streak. While this won’t guarantee they’ll win, it does provide a helping advantage.</p><h4 id="h14596"><a id=""></a><strong>HERO UPDATES</strong></h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Armor health has been reverted to provide a flat damage reduction of 5 per projectile, up to a maximum of 50% damage reduction.</li><li>Out-of-combat health regeneration changed from 20 health per second to 10 health per second + 5% of maximum health.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: Armor is being reverted to its original functionality to better resistance rapid fire damage and shotgun-type weapons. Out- of- combat health regeneration has been a positive but subtle addition to the game, but had a much smaller impact for tank heroes due to their massive health pools, so we’re adjusting it to heal for a percentage of maximum health.</p><h4 id="h14597"><a id=""></a><strong>TANKS</strong></h4><p>Role Passive</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Tanks now have 25% damage reduction against critical headshot damage.</li><li>Knockback resistance increased from 30% to 50%</li></ul><p>Developer Comment: Although armor health will now be more effective in some of the more difficult matchups, it will also be losing potency against the typically slower, higher damage instances. To help reduce the feeling of tanks being taken out too quickly by high bursts of damage, the role-wide passive now provides improved defense against critical headshot damage.</p><h4 id="h14598"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKER QUEEN</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junker Queen being able to activate Commanding Shout while swinging her axe or during her Ultimate ability will make it more responsive for when an additional burst of health or movement speed is needed.</p><p><strong>Commanding Shout</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can now be activated while using other abilities.</li><li>Cooldown reduced from 14 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><h4 id="h14599"><a id=""></a><strong>SIGMA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Similar to how Graviton Surge functions, Gravitic Flux no longer needs line of sight to affect enemy targets in its area. There are a fair amount of counterplay options to deal with this ultimate so we’re making it more reliable to grab enemy targets within its area of effect.</p><p><strong>Gravitic Flux</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>No longer requires line of sight to the center of the effect.</li></ul><h3 id="h14600"><a id=""></a>WRECKING BALL</h3><p>Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has been performing much better after his recent update and these tuning changes will help his abilities feel more impactful.</p><p><strong>Grappling Claw</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 50 to 60.</li></ul><p><strong>Piledriver</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Movement lockout duration for enemies increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds.</li></ul><p><strong>Minefield</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Damage increased from 130 to 165.</li><li>Explosion knockback increased from 5 to 10.</li></ul><h4 id="h14601"><a id=""></a><strong>ZARYA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: We have been increasing the value of some tank ultimate abilities to account for the increased health pools and it helps to make the decision of when to counter-swap more of an interesting tradeoff. Graviton Surge was still very useful to set up combos with other ultimate abilities but we want to makes sure it’s powerful enough on its own.</p><p><strong>Graviton Surge</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Radius increased from 6 to 7 meters.</li><li>Duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds</li></ul><h4 id="h14602"><a id=""></a><strong>DAMAGE</strong></h4><h4 id="h14603"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKRAT</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junkrat’s weapon has great damage output but is unreliable outside of close range due to its slow projectile speed, which is an intended drawback to its high output. The Season 9 health changes affected Junkrat more than most other heroes since it now requires one more shot to secure an elimination. We’re increasing the damage on direct impacts to return to 2 direct hits for an elimination, without making his combo with Concussion Mine as deadly as before since that one is much easier to execute.</p><p><strong>Frag Launcher</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 40 to 45 (Total damage increased from 120 to 125).</li></ul><h4 id="h14604"><a id=""></a><strong>ECHO</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: While the main benefit of Duplicate is a second health pool and the utility of another hero’s abilities, it was often too difficult to charge an ultimate in the Duplicate time limit so we’re increasing the bonus multiplier slightly.</p><p><strong>Duplicate</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ultimate gain multiplier while transformed increased from 4 to 4.5.</li></ul><h4 id="h14605"><a id=""></a><strong>HANZO</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: The Dragonstrike ultimate hasn’t been very effective outside of being used in a combo with other abilities that restrict enemy movement, so we’re increasing its speed to help position it as less of a zoning tool and more likely to deal some damage.</p><p>Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second.</p><p><strong>Dragonstrike</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second.</li></ul><h4 id="h14606"><a id=""></a><strong>SUPPORT</strong></h4><h4 id="h14607"><a id=""></a><strong>BRIGITTE</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Resetting the Shield Bash cooldown on ultimate activation was too much potential burst damage for Brigitte when the average maximum health of everyone was lower, but it’s much more reasonable now that it won’t be as lethal.</p><p><strong>Rally</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Now resets Shield Bash cooldown upon activation.</li></ul><h4 id="h14608"><a id=""></a><strong>BUG FIXES</strong></h4><p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a bug with Mirrorwatch not generating stats in Game Reports.</li><li>Fixed a bug with Competitive Progress not incrementing correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>MAPS</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>General bug fixes and improvements were performed on multiple maps.</li></ul><p>Eichenwalde</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an area that could cause players to temporarily become stuck.</li></ul><p>Samoa</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a spot on the map that players could become temporarily stuck in.</li></ul><p>Shambali</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a location where players could become stuck for a period of time.</li></ul><p><strong>HEROES</strong></p><p>Mercy</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Vengeance Skin - Fixed a bug with the feathers on the skin not being properly aligned.</li></ul><p>Venture</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that counted turrets and other non-player targets as valid for the Excavation Annihilation challenge.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could occur with Burrow where Venture could remain burrowed above the ground.</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Diablo 4's recent Loot Reborn update made a variety of changes to the game, but it seems that one tiny shift in particular might cause you a big headache if you aren't familiar with it. In short, the "Salvage All Items" function does just that: It salvages all your items, including your legendaries and uniques, so make sure you know that before you press it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1csjgu7/psa_salvage_all_items_means_all_items_now/" rel="nofollow ">a post</a> on the Diablo subreddit, Salvage All Items used to ignore your uniques and legendaries, apparently assuming that you would want to keep these high-value items. The button will no longer make such distinctions, which at least one member of the community learned the hard way. Consider this your warning. The good news is that you can double-tap the mark-as-junk button in order to mark each of these items as your "favorites," which will make Salvage All Items avoid them again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/">Loot Reborn</a> update made the biggest changes that the game has seen yet, focusing on retooling its core mechanics and gameplay to improve the experience. For example, it totally changed the way item rolls work, with more-potent affixes across the board. It also added two new ways of upgrading a weapon: Tempering, which adds another affix from a Tempering Recipe, and Masterworking, which boosts all of the affixes to make the weapon more powerful.</p>

Players who are struggling with interstellar dogfights but finding ground combat too easy can now tweak those combat difficulty settings individually, making space combat easier and ground combat harder, or vice versa. Additionally, players who find the "Very Hard" difficulty level too easy and are hungry for a more intense combat experience can try out the new "Extreme" difficulty mode instead, which promises a high-octane challenge.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield May Update</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The May Update also includes <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/174M0cdUyxhn9mI0AvkcN9/starfield-update-1-11-36-may-15-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new performance options</a> for players who are exploring the stars via an Xbox Series X. Series X can now choose between 30fps 40fps, 60fps, or an uncapped frame rate, provided they have a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) display running 120hz. But all is not lost for those without a VRR display--players with lower-quality displayers will still be able to select either 30fps or 60fps, and all Series X players now have access to a setting that allows them to prioritize visual performance over gameplay performance, and vice versa. A large number of bugs--especially those affecting the game's many quests--have also been addressed via the new update.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the May Update doesn't include vehicles for quicker groundside travel, Bethesda confirmed earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">ground vehicles are indeed in the works</a>, but the developer declined to share information regarding when those vehicles will become available to players. It's possible the new ground vehicles will launch around the same time as Starfield's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">Shattered Space expansion</a>, which is set to arrive sometime this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For a closer look at everything Starfield's massive May Update has to offer, check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 id="PATCH_NOTES">PATCH NOTES</h2><div

Produced by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It may only take a week to hold the annual Game Developer Conference in San Francisco every spring, but the actual work of planning, orchestrating, and marketing the convention is a year-round process. It’s a job performed by far fewer people than you might think, and is one that requires a lot of spreadsheets, even more Post-It notes, and as many hours as it takes to sort through literally hundreds of panel submissions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To shine a light on this Herculean endeavor, editor-in-chief Danielle Riendeau talks to GDC content marketing manager Beth Elderkin, as well as conference producer Sam Warnke, for a thoroughly illuminating discussion on this month’s episode of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how many people does it take to organize those hundreds of discrete events into one contiguous, coherent week’s worth of systematized programming? Far fewer than most would guess.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I have no idea how the programming team does it,” Elderkin says of Warnke’s unit. “There’s hundreds of talks, between 600 and 1,000 talks, and they curate through all of them and guide the speakers and guide the advisors through the process.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“When you're looking at each day of GDC,” she continues, “one person is in charge of organizing two of those days, and two people are in charge of organizing three of those days.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I oversee the Summits program and I am much more of a spreadsheet girly,” Warnke says. “Whereas on the Core Concept side, my colleague Kysa Korosi oversees that and she and Ashley Corrigan, also on our team, they use a physical board and move things around with magnets. I've seen pictures of this magnet board and it's a beast, and props to them because putting together the Wednesday through Friday program physically in that way—I can’t wrap my brain around it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scheduling isn’t the only hurdle that needs clearing, of course, in order for GDC to happen the way that it does. There’s also the work of liaising with the myriad publishers, developers and organizations that might want to be a part of the show, such as this year’s collaboration with the Video Game History Foundation to produce the Game History Gallery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It was so incredible to see these physical artifacts of games from the past, and also playable games that just don't technically exist anymore,” Warnke says. “It's really heartbreaking how much hard work is lost, and how many nostalgic pieces of people's lives just become unusable, or things that they can't revisit, they’re worlds that they can't revisit, and it's vitally important that we do continue this work of game preservation and continue to support foundations like the Video Game History Foundation.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland.872100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As Ubisoft looks forward to its 2025 fiscal year, the company has decided to cancel its free-to-play <em>Division</em> game, <em>The Division Heartland</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><em>Heartland </em>was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-announces-free-to-play-the-division-heartland/">announced back in 2021</a>, with Ubisoft aiming to have the game in players’ hands by 2022. The planned release window didn’t work out, but in September 2022 we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/free-to-play-division-heartland-resurgence-gameplay/">got another look at <em>Heartland</em></a>, and the game appeared to have everything you’d expect from a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. The game mixed in survival elements, pitting players against enemies swarming the fictional midwestern town of Silver Creek.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">In Ubisoft’s <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal earnings</a> earlier today, mixed in with all the numbers and projections, was the <em>Heartland</em> news. The company wrote, “In line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on <em>The Division Heartland</em> and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as <em>XDefiant </em>and <em>Rainbow Six</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft’s road ahead seems to be focusing on only the biggest money makers. Last year fans were disappointed when the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel/">canceled plans for an <em>Immortal Fenyx Rising </em>sequel</a>, and of course, the company followed general industry trends by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-sees-layoffs-amid-year-full-of-them/">laying off employees</a>. According to the earnings report, Ubisoft cut 1,700 jobs over the course of just 18 months. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, Ubisoft’s back catalog seems to have been one of its most reliable streams of revenue. The report specifically calls out <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>as being a huge boon to the company, and unsurprisingly the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise also helped grease the wheels. Hopefully that will encourage Ubisoft to reexamine its decision to revoke digital licenses for old games <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fans-are-incredibly-unhappy-about-ubisoft-revoking-licenses-and-game-files-for-the-crew-following-server-shutdown/">like it did with <em>The Crew</em></a> just last month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The world wasn’t exactly dying for another free-to-play shooter, but it’s still disappointing to see a game that devs worked on for years suddenly get the ax. Maybe Ubisoft was hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-skull-and-bones/">another release like <em>Skull and Bones</em></a>, while also drawing attention to its bigger upcoming releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

This is great news for retro gaming fans with iPhones because it can emulate a truly eye-crossing number of retro consoles once installed.</p><p>In fact, there are too many to list here. But some notable emulation cores — the actual separately developed emulation software — included in this version of RetroArch are the NEC PC Engine, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, Virtual Boy, Neo Geo Pocket, and even the PSP (using the same core that drives the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">PPSSPP app</a> that went up today). You can see the list in full by clicking “more” on RetroArch’s description in its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fretroarch%2Fid6499539433">App Store listing</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>Just look at this glorious list of emulator cores.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screen recording: RetroArch</cite></p></div><p>Strictly speaking, RetroArch isn’t an emulator but, rather, a front end that you can drop emulator cores into. So when you want to play a game, you need to load that game’s core first (although if you try to load a game with the wrong core, it will try to suggest the proper one for you). The app also has features like online gameplay, remapping buttons or keys per emulation core or per game, fast-forward and rewind, and gyro control. </p><p>You’ll need to be on iOS / iPadOS 14.2 to run the new version of RetroArch or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063353/could-emulators-be-great-in-the-vision-pro">own a Vision Pro</a>. It’s not available on the Mac version of the App Store, but that’s not a problem since there’s a macOS version (and versions for other operating systems as well) that you can <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">easily download from the RetroArch website</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update  May 15th, 2024, 3:14PM ET: </strong>Added images and more detail.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We’re just a couple of days away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-comes-to-pc-in-may">Ghost of Tsushima’s PC release date</a>, as the former PlayStation exclusive prepares to drop its Director's Cut - including its expansion and multiplayer DLC - on Steam. Having recently cleared up the question around whether you’ll need to sign in with a PSN account after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">the Helldivers 2 debacle</a> - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won’t work on Steam Deck.</p>

<p>The devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-devs-reassure-after-helldivers-2-fallout">confirmed last week</a> that we won’t need to create or sign in with a PlayStation Network account to play Ghost of Tsushima’s single-player campaign or the Iki Island expansion, looking to seemingly quell the risk of a backlash similar to that suffered by Arrowhead after announcing a mandatory PSN login for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> (which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later dropped</a> - and then turned into a tongue-in-cheek cape - due to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">the sheer shitstorm of complaints</a>).</p>
<p>A sign-in will be needed for the co-op Legends mode, which was originally released as free DLC for the PlayStation 4 game, though: and therein lies the rub. While Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut will be technically supported by the Steam Deck - at least if you’re looking to play the main game in bed/on the bus/on the toilet - its developers confirmed that it’ll appear as “Unsupported” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">on Steam</a> due to multiplayer being unable to work as the result of the PSN integration.</p>
<p>“You may notice that Steam marks the game as 'Unsupported' for Steam Deck. This is due to the Legends co-op multiplayer mode requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features,” Nixxes and Sucker Punch explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/featured/?emclan=103582791474434698&amp;emgid=4188987871078331985">blog post</a> announcing the game’s pre-load going live.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine that that many people would consider a portable handheld to really be the best way to play an online multiplayer mode, but it’s still frustrating to see the restriction - especially as the much-bemoaned PSN login requirement appears to be directly to blame.</p>
<p>That’s also despite one of the arguably positive features of the PSN connection - cross-play between PlayStation and PC users - only being available in a ‘beta’ form at launch, with the devs saying it’ll be functional but won’t automatically match users on different platforms to begin with. You’ll have to invite your friends to make the most of it - which is probably the best way to play Legends regardless, but not ideal if you’re flying solo and looking to hop into a game as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that all of this follows the news that Ghost of Tsushima’s PC port <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">won’t be sold on Steam in nearly 180 countries</a> - including Japan, <em>the very country in which the game is set</em> - due to the PSN login requirement for Legends. (Helldivers 2 was similarly pulled from sale in dozens of countries, including those where PSN accounts can’t even be created.)</p>
<p>Y’know, I’m really starting to question whether forcing a separate login for PlayStation Network on top of these games is all it’s cracked up to be.</p>

For those who likely don’t understand the significance of the move, this is the <em>very </em>first gun that players would’ve picked up and fired in the tutorial of the first <em>Destiny </em>way back in 2014.</p><p>Though the Khvostov auto-rifle you picked up just outside of Old Russia was a piece of shit that most players probably scrapped as soon as they could, this iteration of it is sure to be no joke. The Khvostov 7G-0X looks mostly the same—though it now boasts the paint job of one of its ornaments from the first <em>Destiny</em> as the base appearance—but it has a new Exotic perk that makes every seventh round fired ricochet between enemies. Seeing as how auto-rifles tend to feature magazines in the mid-20s, that’s a few guaranteed ricochets per reload, which might prove handy for clearing mobs of enemies when players undoubtedly take this weapon into endgame content.</p><p>Crucially, this isn’t the first time Bungie has re-released this weapon and made it into an Exotic. The first <em>Destiny</em>’s <em>Rise of Iron </em>expansion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destinypedia.com/Khvostov_7G-0X&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Khvostov_7G-0X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also featured the Khvostov 7G-0X</a></span>, which was obtainable via an Exotic quest, though that version of the gun was entirely different. It lacked an Exotic perk that gave it a unique ability, but what made the <em>Rise of Iron </em>Khvostov significant was that it was highly customizable; it had upwards of 100 possible perk combinations that made it highly malleable to any kind of gameplay, whether it was PvE or PvP.</p><p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is (sorry) <em>shaping </em>up to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-witness-traveler-ending-1850705113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-witness-traveler-ending-1850705113">huge final chapter</a></span> for the franchise’s ten-year history, and what better way to do so then by honoring the past with the very first weapon players ever used. A lot of <em>The Final Shape</em> seems to be leaning into nostalgia, considering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotics-trailer-release-date-1850762166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotics-trailer-release-date-1850762166">Pale Heart setting</a></span> will apparently resemble locales that players have visited before. Not to mention, Nathan Fillion is returning to <em>Destiny 2 </em>to reprise his role as the jokester Hunter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-cayde-6-trailer-1851428894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-cayde-6-trailer-1851428894">Cayde-6</a></span>, who has been dead since 2018’s acclaimed <em>Forsaken </em>expansion. I’d wager Bungie isn’t done bringing back beloved artifacts of <em>Destiny</em>’s past as it closes the book on this arc of the series, but I guess we’ll know more once <em>The Final Shape </em>launches in a few short weeks. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game will put players into the shoes of both a shinobi and a samurai in feudal Japan. While much of Assassin's Creed Shadows will sound familiar to fans--parkour, a large open world to explore, stealth assassinations, melee combat--there are some notable changes, particularly when it comes to filling out the game's map.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the past, these have been done via synchronization points. These points are usually atop tall buildings or towers. Traditionally, synchronizing sees the camera slowly rotate in a panoramic view of the surrounding area, before marking all nearby points of interest on the in-game map.</p><p dir="ltr">That won't be the case in Assassin's Creed Shadows. There will be no spinning panoramic views in the upcoming title when synchronizing, nor will synchronizing automatically reveal nearby points of interest. Instead, players will need to survey the area and manually highlight areas of potential interest before investigating them further once back on the ground. Synchronization points will, however, still allow for players to fast travel between them.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a small, but significant change, as synchronization points, including their stylish, slow camera pan of the surrounding area, have largely worked the same for much of the franchise's long history. Other changes in Assassin's Creed Shadows include the lack of a bird that can be used to mark enemies, though players will still have access to Eagle Vision to track nearby foes. Light sources, shadows, and the weather will also play an important role in gameplay. For the first time in the franchise's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows will star a real historical figure as one of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-protagonists-launches-november-15/1100-6523473/" data-ref-id="1100-6523473">dual protagonists: the African samurai, Yasuke</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows will be similar in size to 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-origins/" data-ref-id="5000-465527">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, Ubisoft has said, which means there should be plenty of Japan to explore. It will feature a non-linear campaign story revolving around tracking down and eliminating specific targets, according to Ubisoft, and it's one that will also see players building out a spy network to gather intel on targets in a system that sounds similar to one seen in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows will release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 15.

        <p>Satya Nadella mandate to increase profits prompts "unease".</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>    <div>



            <p>
A fresh report into the inner workings of Microsoft and the influence of its top boss Satya Nadella has shed new light on the pressure for Xbox to release more of its games on rival platforms in a bid to boost profits. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">Windows Central</a> states that the plan to launch more Xbox games on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, an operation dubbed "Latitude", has sparked "debate and unease" within the company at whether the move makes sense. 
</p>
<p>
Publicly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">Xbox has suggested it is testing the waters with the four games launched so far</a> - multiplatform titles that could benefit from more players, like Sea of Thieves and Grounded, as well as smaller titles that have already reached the majority of their likely audience on Xbox, like Hi-Fi Rush and Pentiment. 
</p>
<p>
But, privately, Microsoft is reportedly pushing for no "red line" at all around which games Xbox will eventually launch on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, in a bid to increase margins. </p>
<p>Eurogamer understands numerous other games are under consideration, including titles in the company's largest franchises.

</div><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's been a tough time for the wider games industry and Xbox in particular, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">falling console sales and another generation stuck way behind Sony</a>, layoffs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-last-stroll-through-redfall-at-the-pace-it-was-always-meant-to-be-played">game launches that haven't set tills ringing</a>. </p>
<p>Last year's $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard was a huge bet that helped keep Xbox in profit, but also feels like it contributed to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">cull of smaller Bethesda projects and multiple studios last week</a> in order to better balance the books - or as Xbox studios boss Matt Booty put it, ensure a "reprioritisation of titles and resources" to focus on "priority games".</p>
<p>"Put simply, Xbox bet an obscene amount of money on a future that hasn't happened," Chris Dring wrote last week, describing why Xbox believes it must cut costs now. "The market has shifted under its feet and it's having to alter direction. And some of its teams are having to pay the price." 
</p>
<p>Making games multiplatform is another move to boost profits, and should not be a surprising move following Nadella's past comment that he had "no love" for console exclusives. In the short-term, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">it has unsurprisingly found some financial success</a>. But at what cost? </p>
<p>"The philosophy of a great video game platform holder is that it makes money in order to make more consoles and more games. The philosophy of Microsoft - and by dint of that, Xbox - is evidently that it only makes consoles and games in order to make money," Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-the-point-of-xbox">wrote last week</a>. "Like so many businesses owned by gigantic, publicly-traded mega-companies, Xbox is now stuck in a cycle of thinking back-to-front. It, and I suspect much of the video game world, no longer knows why it exists."</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-is-teasing-a-classic-dungeons-dragons-monster-as-its-next-killer">teasing an upcoming chapter inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> has revealed its next killer pulled from the pages of the fantasy pen-and-paper RPG: Vecna, long-running mega-baddie and <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/series/dungeons-and-dragons/feature/who-is-vecna-dnd-stranger-things-critical-role">inspiration for the Stranger Things villain</a>. He’ll be voiced by Critical Role dungeon master Matthew Mercer and haunt a new dungeon map, where you’ll be able to do battle as new elf and bard survivors able to roll a literal d20 when they crack open treasure chests.</p>

<p>After teasing a D&amp;D crossover last week with a clip of a Beholder banging on cell bars, Dead by Daylight devs Behaviour Interactive revealed their plans for the next chapter during an <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/anniversary-recap-2024/">eighth anniversary steam</a> for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than the Beholder, it’s Vecna who’ll be the D&amp;D-inspired killer when the chapter launches on June 3rd (though you can give it a go right now in the game’s Public Test Build). The Mercer-voiced lich will have four spells - a first for DBD - to wield, including the power to fly, fire off a hail of nasty projectiles, lift up or drop wooden pallets using D&amp;D favourite Mage Hand, and negate magical items and reveal survivors in a Dispelling Sphere.</p>
<p>Those magical items can include Vecna’s own Hand and Eye, which can be found in treasure chests around the new Forgotten Ruins map alongside other magical items that help survivors to move more quietly or teleport between lockers. When those chests are opened, the game will roll the classic d20 to see what players find, granting Vecna’s powerful gear on a nat 20 - though a critical fail will cause trouble for them instead.</p>
<p>The new survivor(s) will be The Troupe, comprised of Baermar Uraz and Aestri Yazar - human and elf bard characters with the power to create illusions, cast Bardic Inspiration to speed up their allies’ generator-fixing and spot nearby generators and items with Still Sight.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>After the D&amp;D chapter releases in early June, Behaviour teased an upcoming chapter inspired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castlevania">Castlevania</a>. We’ll know more about that on August 6th, though a bloodsucking Dracula and a Belmont survivor of some kind - perhaps in an upside-down castle? - is a fairly safe bet.</p>
<p>Also arriving this summer will be a brand new supersized casual mode, which doubles the number of players to pit two killers against a whopping eight survivors. Instead of being hooked, caught survivors will be caged - presumably to help balance the killers’ odds - with perks disabled and replaced by a class system, I’d assume for the same reason. There will be team abilities for the killers to use, though, to help make up for a limited roster of five killers at first: the Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress and Nurse.</p>
<p>More details on the 2v8 mode will be shared in July, Behaviour said, with the mode launching in an early form later in the summer.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during the stream, Behaviour gave another look at Supermassive’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassive-reveal-the-casting-of-frank-stone-a-single-player-dead-by-daylight-game">narrative spin-off The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, teased an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_DhOrH4Ds">Insider Programme for codenamed PvE game Project T</a> and revealed another DBD spin-off: a two-player co-op roguelite set inside a Jumanji-like cursed board game titled What the Fog, which is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/">out now and costs less than a fiver</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, in the middle of its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year financial report</a>, Ubisoft announced that the free-to-play game Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland has been canceled. The publisher will reinvest in <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-release-date-preseason-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDefiant</a> and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six instead. Here's the full quote:</p>
<p><em>As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, which is now organized into three engagement hubs and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</em></p>
<p>The Division Heartland was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-heartland-f2p-pc-console-game-announced-alongside-new-mobile-game-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in May 2021 alongside the mobile game (now known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-resurgence-free-to-play-mobile-alpha-sign-ups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resurgence</a>) and new content for The Division 2. Developed by Red Storm, it was set in the small Midwestern town of Silver Creek, a quiet hamlet ravaged by the so-called Dollar Flu and later occupied by various Division agents.</p>
<p>Players would have selected from a roster of playable characters and engaged in various PvE and PvP activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Massive PvEvP in Storm Operations</strong>&nbsp;- Fight together in 45-player PvEvP Storm Operations against a group of dangerous Rogue agents, an aggressive faction known as the Vultures, all while surviving a lethal virus.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Prep the Battlefield in PvE Excursion Operations</strong>&nbsp;- Complete PvE missions, gather gear, activate alerts, and prep the battlefield in Excursion Operations.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Progress and Adapt to Survive</strong> - Play as one of six agents and select between three classes each match, all with their own perks and skills.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In late 2023, the Taiwanese rating board <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-heartland-could-finally-launch-in-early-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was found to have rated the game</a>, prompting speculation that The Division Heartland would soon be launched. However, Ubisoft decided to shut down operations. The Division fans can look forward to the launch of Resurgence later this year, according to Ubisoft.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-is-finally-great.872031/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="iPs0Ms">When a live-service game undergoes a massive systems overhaul, it’s often characterized as a reversal, a change of course, even a mea culpa — particularly if the game had been headed in a direction the community didn’t like. But a truly successful update of this type is one that enables a game to be more fully itself; to unlock something beautiful that was always present at its core, just tough to get to.</p>
<p id="pmRVHQ">That’s what Blizzard did in 2014 with the “Loot 2.0” update for <em>Diablo 3</em>, which rescued a game that had been floundering since a launch beset by technical issues, an unpopular in-game auction house, and a perceived softening of the tone of this fantasy horror series. But Loot 2.0 didn’t make <em>Diablo 3</em> more like the fan favorite <em>Diablo 2</em>. It made it more like itself — flamboyant, frenetic, and surreal in its randomization — while extravagantly upping the rewards for playing, and liberating the superb combat design that had always been nestled at the game’s heart.</p>
<p id="FJi2G1">With the season 4 update for <em>Diablo 4</em> — called Loot Reborn, surely a nod to that celebrated Loot 2.0 patch — Blizzard has done it again. I wanted the patch to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23885679/diablo-3-vs-diablo-4-season-29">make the game more like <em>Diablo 3</em></a>, because I’m a <em>Diablo 3</em> fan, but it hasn’t. It’s done something better, unearthing an all-new item game within <em>Diablo 4</em> that has its own unique flavor. After just a few hours’ play, it’s clear how much more fun the game is now.</p>

<p id="6MwTbx">Season 4 has also done more than revolutionize the way loot works to make it more rewarding and less of a head-scratching nightmare of admin. It’s brought Helltides, previously a late-game activity, right into the core of the game from the start. These massively multiplayer-style live events, which draw players to areas of the map that are being assaulted by demon armies for an hour at a time, have been redesigned to make them much more intense and engaging. Now, Helltides promote an aspect of <em>Diablo 4</em> that has a distinct feel from its predecessors, with players pouring in from across the map to take on big bosses out in the open, rather than delving individually into dungeons.</p>
<p id="Dcpsb2">Unlike in previous <em>Diablo 4 </em>seasons, you don’t need to start a new character to enjoy Loot Reborn. Most of the changes and new content in this patch are permanent, and can be found on the Eternal Realm (where characters live forever and share progress) as well as the Seasonal Realm (where you need to start from scratch in most, but not quite all, things). So you can jump in with any of your previous characters.</p>
<p id="61Id0Z">That said, I actually recommend rolling a new character (seasonal or otherwise) to make the most of the patch. I had a great time leveling a new Rogue, but when I switched to a higher-level character (in the mid-40s) that I played back at the game’s launch, I could immediately tell that she wasn’t balanced correctly for the way the game works now. All her equipment was marked as “legacy” items, and she felt puny and fragile, particularly lacking the healing bonuses that are a focus of the new itemization design. It probably wouldn’t take too long to kit her out properly with post-patch loot, but it felt like it might be a bit of a slog to get there.</p>

<p id="chcXtu">The better news is that the improvements to <em>Diablo 4</em> are immediately apparent from level 1. There are new endgame systems here, like the Masterworking crafting system, which ties into a new endgame dungeon type, the Pit of Artificers. And the streamlining and liberating effects of the new loot system will probably be best appreciated by players who penetrate deep into <em>Diablo 4</em>’s meta. But they can be easily sensed almost as soon as you start playing.</p>
<p id="zuJtn3">The first thing you notice is that loot is exciting again. Slightly fewer items drop, and they have more potent affixes that are easier to understand. There are fewer arcane, situational damage bonuses, and more clearly legible boosts to your character’s power and survivability. You can more readily feel the effect of an item when you equip it, and it’s easier to understand how it fits into your character build (or doesn’t). So far, so <em>Diablo 3</em>.</p>
<p id="N2TEtV">Where Loot Reborn departs from that template is in a new crafting system, Tempering, which allows you to collect recipes for powerful affixes and then use them to enhance your loot. This replaces the old item upgrade system with a much more bespoke form of customization that’s less of a resource grind, and that gives you a creative way to tailor your equipment to your build. A potentially even bigger deal than Tempering is the revamped Codex of Power, which now collects the build-defining Aspects from Legendary weapons when you salvage them, and automatically stores only the best roll of each Aspect, which can then be applied to other items indefinitely. It’s a hugely powerful resource that’s far simpler to use, and it finally realizes the developers’ dream of a database of powerful skills that grows with the player, and constantly expands the horizons of the character builds they create.</p>

<p id="cvYLcB">So, yes, the loot is simpler and better. But Tempering and the Codex of Power, between them, define <em>Diablo 4</em> as a crafting game that gives the player an ever-growing, flexible set of tools to dial in a character build. Crucially, those tools are now easy and fun to use, fed by and feeding into a steady stream of interesting loot.</p>
<p id="7tIrZr"><em>Diablo 4</em> can still be a fussy game. Players returning after a long absence might be overwhelmed by a map crowded with icons and the seemingly infinite number of currencies, resources, and progress bars. But the developers have rightly identified their revamped Helltides as something that can cut through all this noise. The loop is simple but deeply satisfying: Slaughter demons to collect Aberrant Cinders to trade in for Tortured Gifts (i.e., good loot). The longer you keep your run going, the higher your Threat builds and the hairier things get; die, and your Threat resets, but you also lose a bunch of Cinders. The steady escalation of the stakes is really effective, as is the way these events draw players together for a common cause, giving the game a lively, MMO-esque feel.</p>
<p id="3D6DTW">I’m only a few hours and 21 levels into Loot Reborn (if anything, leveling is a little too fast at the moment), but it has absolutely reignited my desire to delve into a game that only briefly grabbed me at launch. What’s really surprised me is how much more personality <em>Diablo 4</em> has now. It feels like a game that has stepped out of the shadow of its illustrious predecessors and its makers’ live-service ambitions, and made a case for its own way of doing things. That’s a thrilling result. </p>

But unlike those games, which require you to guess and check the facts of murders and other mysterious events,<em> Chants of Sennaar</em> centers its brain games around language.</p><p>That starts with the setting and basic premise of the game. Taking inspiration from the biblical Tower of Babel, <em>Chants of Sennaar</em> takes place at the very base of a large, winding structure that has been stratified into different societies. Each has its own spoken language, written alphabet, and culture. Your job is to make it to the top of the tower, a task that requires talking to and understanding the many people you come into contact with. But at the start of the game, you can’t understand anything at all, and the game doesn’t hold your hand through the process of learning these languages. Instead, it’s about putting together context clues and thinking about the way we utilize words. </p><figure id="" data-id="ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-recommend-id="image://ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A notebook with images and symbols to decode" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A notebook with images and symbols to decode" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Focus Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-recommend-id="image://ebdb448813c01361df0dbf9ee616b7fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A notebook with images and symbols to decode" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you encounter characters in the game that speak to you in foreign tongues, an in-game notebook will fill with every letter in the alphabet.

As you continue through the world, your guess will either be confirmed by how it fits into what more characters say, or you will quickly realize you were way off base.<br></p><p>The puzzles start with something as simple as translating “open” and “close” in the game’s opening minutes when you’re blocked by a closed-off gate, and quickly progress into linguistic detective work about understanding tenses, different ways sentences can be structured, and punctuation. It’s not long before you also have to translate between multiple languages at the same time. If that sounds boring, I can’t tell you how wrong you are. At one point I realized one language would repeat a noun’s symbol to indicate it was plural while another had a specific symbol to denote a noun was plural and I felt like the smartest person in the world.</p><p><em>Chants of Sennaar</em> is a game for people whose favorite gaming accessory is a pen and notebook. It rewards critical thinking and observation of the game world. But even with its complex challenges, the game can be finished in less than ten hours.

<p>With the many recent titles launching from Ubisoft featuring an in-game store full of cosmetic and convenience items, like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Skull and Bones, most of us are curious about Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Will it feature microtransactions? Is Assassin’s Creed Shadows always online? Here’s what we know so far!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-assassin-s-creed-shadows-require-a-constant-internet-connection">Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Require a Constant Internet Connection?</h2>



<p>We can confirm that Assassin’s Creed Shadows requires a constant internet connection to play. Most of Ubisoft’s titles have always-online requirements, especially with their recent attempts to push microtransactions via in-game stores from the menu.</p>



<p>I don’t doubt Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature some form of cosmetics, especially considering how aesthetic samurai armor typically appears in video games. There’s a lot of room for cosmetic armor sets, like those seen in Ghost of Tsushima, and many players will eat that up!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-are-naoe-and-yasuke-the-first-assassin-s-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-all">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-are-naoe-and-yasuke-the-first-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Are Naoe and Yasuke? The First Assassin’s Creed Shadows Trailer Reveals All</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-does-assassin-s-creed-shadows-have-microtransactions">Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Have Microtransactions?</h2>



<p>We do know that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature cosmetics in the form of armor, weapons, and animal companion skins. Plus, the game features a hideout mechanic, in which you can customize your lair to suit your style within the Shinobi League.</p>



<p>If you purchase the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Ultimate Edition, you’ll receive the Ultimate Pack, which includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Sekiryu Character Pack</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gear and Weapon Sets for Naoe and Yasuke</li>



<li>Sekiryu Beast</li>



<li>Dragon Tooth Trinket</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>The Sekiryu Hideout Pack</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unique ornaments for the hideout</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Five Skill Points</strong></li>



<li><strong>Red Dragon Filter in Photo Mode</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s safe to assume that, like past Ubisoft titles, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature an in-game store, accessible from the main menu and in-game menu, with various cosmetics and convenience items available for real money purchase.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re as excited as you are for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but in the meantime, check out what else Insider Gaming is up to:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-game-catalog-additions-for-may-2024-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Sony has revealed the full line-up of PlayStation Plus Games Catalog additions for May 2024, which includes Red Dead Redemption 2, Cat Quest, Watch Dogs, and more.</p><p>Announced on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, a total of 13 games are joining the library: 10 in the Games Catalog available to Extra and Premium members and three in the Classic Games Catalog only available to Premium members.</p><p>While perhaps a thinner line-up compared to recent months, the addition of Red Dead Redemption 2 will carry May's line-up a long way. It's worth noting this is actually a return to the service for Rockstar's open-world cowboy adventure, however, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-playstation-plus-games-lineup-red-dead-redemption-2-assassins-creed-valhalla-and-more">it was one of the first games announced for the Games Catalog</a> two years prior. All games hit the service on May 21.</p><h3>PlayStation Plus Games Catalog Additions for April 2024</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/deceive-inc">Deceive Inc</a> | PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4: City Living</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/crime-boss-rockay-city">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> | PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-settlers-new-allies">The Settlers: New Allies</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stranded-alien-dawn">Stranded: Alien Dawn</a> | PS4 + PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/cat-quest">Cat Quest</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/cat-quest-ii-the-lupus-empire">Cat Quest 2</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-lego-movie-2-videogame">The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game</a> | PS4</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> | PS4</li></ul><h3>PlayStation Plus Classics Games Catalog Additions for April 2024</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/2-xtreme">2Xtreme</a> | PS4 + PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/g-police">G-Police</a> | PS4 + PS5</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/07/worms-pinball">Worms Pinball</a> | PS4 + PS5</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar Games' take on the wild west as players take on the role of Arthur Morgan as he looks tries to survive in America's unforgiving heartland. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review">IGN deemed it a masterpiece in our review</a>. "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era," we said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Deceive Inc. deploys you into the world of high stakes subterfuge, working for a private corporation with complete monopoly over the international espionage market. Rival spies are after the same objective as the player, however, and each one of them is as equally skilled, cunning, and well-equipped.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-sims-4/City_Living_Guide">The Sims 4: City Living</a> is an expansion for the beloved simulation game, and while the base version of Sims 4 is required to play, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-base-game-will-soon-become-totally-free">this is also permanently free</a>. City Living lets players take their Sims to the city and explore everything it has to offer, from bustling action right outside the front door to unique situations that come only with apartment living.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Crime Boss: Rockay City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Crime Boss: Rockay City is a stealth action first person shooter where players look to become the leaders of a criminal underworld in 1990s Florida. IGN didn't rate it very highly, however, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crime-boss-rockay-city-review">giving it a 4/10 in our review</a>. "Crime Boss: Rockay City's hokey charm is nowhere near strong enough to offset its bugs and repetitive design, and it totally squanders its kitsch cast," we said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The latest instalment in the long running strategy game series, The Settlers: New Allies lets players discover new worlds and build sprawling cities as they take control of a band of settlers who have fled cataclysmic events in their homeland to seek new lands to settle, explore, and conquer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>On a somewhat similar note, albeit with a sprinkle of sci-fi, Stranded: Alien Dawn is a planet survival sim placing the fate of a small marooned group in the player's hands. Promising compelling and immersive strategic gameplay, players must make vital decisions to protect their survivors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Cat Quest and its sequel, the aptly titled Cat Quest 2, will both be available through the PlayStation Plus Games Catalog. Both 2D, open world role-playing games set in a world full of cats, players must embark on a quest to save their catnapped sister in the first game while the second sees them fight to save the world of cats from advancing dog armies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>Classic LEGO goodness arrives through The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game, which lets players bash and build their way through the events of the film. Alien monster invaders have left Bricksburg in ruins and taken Emmet's friends, and it's now up to him and his team of heroic characters to go beyond their world and save their friends from the strange inhabitants of the Systar System.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Watch Dogs is the first open-world action game set in the fan-favorite franchise, kicking things off with solemn protagonist Aiden Pearce hacking (with, like, a smartphone) his way through Chicago. "Watch Dogs is an excellent open world action game with some unique hacking magic that makes it a memorable experience," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-dogs-review">IGN said in our 8/10 review</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/a-1715792649682.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>On the classic games front, 2Xtreme was promised to be a high flying sports game where players could snowboard in Japan, in-line skate in Last Vegas, mountain bike in Africa, skateboard in Los Angeles, and more. Unfortunately, however, it couldn't stick the landing, as when the PlayStation classic was re-released for the PlayStation Portable, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/13/2-xtreme-review">IGN gave it a rare 2/10 in our review</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/2-1715792674092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another PlayStation classic, and one that received a better rating from IGN, comes in G-Police. This 1997 title saw Jeff Slater join a voluntary police force after an unspeakable corporate cover-up caused his sister's death. As a helicopter pilot, players must fly through 35 grueling levels to take their revenge. "With a flair for the dramatic and an attention to detail that should impress even the toughest of critics, G-Police is a rock-solid example of great gameplay," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/17/g-police">we said in our 8/10 review.</a></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/3-1715792697534.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Finally, Worms Pinball rounds out May 2024's PlayStation Plus Classic Games Catalog additions, and does exactly what it says on the tin. This 2000 title is a mix of pinball and the wacky Worms characters, offering a table sporting 3D LED displayed sub-games and parallel objectives, transparent ramps, user-controllable moving gadgets, bounce and flip passes, bang backs, death saves, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

In it, you play as both a shinobi assassin and a samurai warrior in feudal Japan, with the ability to switch between the two characters seamlessly. Fans of the series have been requesting this historical setting for a long time, and Ubisoft is finally delivering it. And unlike last year’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, this is a full-priced game, starting at $69.99 -- so you can expect it to be a full-sized open-world experience. Other editions cost more, so let’s break it all down below.</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows (Standard Edition)</h2><div id="200650"><p>Out November 15</p><p><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3></p></div><p><strong>PS5</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/ZRDPD" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $69.99 (free lithograph set)</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/0PYl5" target="_blank">Get it at GameStop</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/6XBv7" target="_blank">Get it at Walmart</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/1vrD5" target="_blank">Get it at PS Store (digital)</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p><strong>Xbox Series X</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPpKk" target="_blank">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $69.99 (free lithograph set)</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/AdWeo" target="_blank">Get it at GameStop</a> - $69.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/4AGgy" target="_blank">Get it at Walmart</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p><strong>PC</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3dXBm" target="_blank">Get it at Gamesplanet</a> - $62.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/yLK3e" target="_blank">Get it at Ubisoft Store</a> - $69.99</li></ul><p>If all you want is the core game and nothing else, you got it dude: grab the standard edition.

So, yeah. Big.</p><p>The game starts out in 1579 Japan, when all kinds of interesting things were happening in the country. Like in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, you play as two protagonists. First there's Naoe, a shinobi assassin, and then there's Yasuke, a real-life historical figure who was an African immigrant who became a samurai.</p><p>Combat-wise, Naoe is more geared toward the stealth approach, while Yasuke is better at going into encounters swinging. As the title implies, shadows play an important role in the game, with a light meter letting you know how visible or hidden you are from enemies. </p><p>And unilke Mirage, AC Shadows will not be available on previous-gen consoles, so no PS4 or Xbox One.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The company will move resources to "bigger opportunities" such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six</h2></div><section><p>Ubisoft has canceled its upcoming free-to-play shooter, Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland, amid larger plans to focus resources on "bigger opportunities."</p><p>This news was revealed as a part of Ubisoft's earnings release this morning, with the company saying it has "redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six." The move is part of a larger, longer process Ubisoft has been undergoing in recent quarters to restructure its teams, cut costs, and concentrate its resources into fewer, bigger games. </p><p>Ubisoft offered the following statement on the cancellation:</p><blockquote>After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</blockquote><p>The Division Heartland was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-free-to-play-the-division-heartland">first announced back in 2021</a>, and was being developed by North Carolina-based Red Storm Entertainment. It was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-quietly-delayed-tom-clancys-the-division-heartland">quietly delayed</a> not long after its reveal with its planned release moving to last fiscal year, but it never materialized. Heartland did go <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-heartland-is-gearing-up-for-another-testing-phase">through multiple testing phases</a>, and was in a publicly playable state. Recently, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-heartland-gets-a-rating-in-taiwan-hinting-a-release-date-could-be-imminent">received a rating in Taiwan</a>, leading fans to believe its release was imminent, but this seems to have been a false alarm.</p><p>Ubisoft has been on a game-cancelling spree of late, having shut down <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">three unannounced games</a> including its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-mysterious-project-q-has-been-cancelled">mysterious Project Q</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-fenyx-rising-2-reportedly-canceled-ubisoft">Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</a> just last year. The prior year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">cancelled four other unannounced games</a>, with the company explaining its decision by saying it had been trying to make too many games at once.</p><p>And in the last year in particular, Ubisoft (like many other major gaming companies) has been undergoing major cost-cutting measures, which have included the aforementioned game cancellations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-plans-to-close-mobile-studio-ubisoft-london-formerly-known-as-future-games-of-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio closures</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency">multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. As noted in Ubisoft's earnings release, it has reduced its employee numbers by over 1,700 people over 18 months "while retention has continued to improve." As of March 2024, Ubisoft employs 19,011 employees globally.</p><p>In today's earnings call, CEO Yves Guillemot told investors the company was "back on track" for a "profitable growth trajectory," noting the company's record annual and quarterly net bookings reported today. Going forward, Guillemot continued, the company will pursue a strategy of returning to leadership in open world adventure games while expanding its games-as-a-service offerings. This year, the company expects to release Assassin's Creed Shadows (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">just fully revealed today</a>), Rainbow Six Mobile, Star Wars Outlaws, The Division Resurgence, and XDefiant.</p><p>And technologically, Ubisoft is narrowing its focus on its own internal game engines to just two branches, Anvil and Snowdrop, and is aggressively pursuing generative AI tech especially with its NEO NPC program.</p><p>For the full year, Ubisoft reported €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) in net bookings, and €401 million ($436 million) in operating income.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<section><p>GameSpot had the opportunity to chat with Midsummer Studios co-founder and XCOM designer Jake Solomon about the studio and its upcoming Gilmore Girls inspired life sim.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Jake Solomon is no stranger to creating complex games; his credits on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown/" data-ref-id="5000-128363">XCOM</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-midnight-suns-tips-for-beginners/1100-6509737/" data-ref-id="1100-6509737">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>, and numerous other strategy games over his 23-year career at Firaxis prove that much. And yet, Solomon's next venture presents the veteran game designer with a challenge he's never before encountered.</p><p dir="ltr">"With this game, I don't even get hit points," Solomon laughed.</p><p dir="ltr">On May 14, Solomon announced that, alongside Firaxis teammate Will Miller and former The Sims' director Grant Rodiek, he was creating a new, independent studio: <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Midsummer Studios</a>. With less than a dozen developers and a whopping $6 million already invested into the studio by a number of different production companies (including Trevor Noah's Day Zero Productions), Midsummer offered Solomon a different approach to game development that feels "more stable." However, this doesn't mean things have been simple--and it's not <em>just </em>because the studio's upcoming game doesn't have hit points.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was pretty naive about funding when I left," Solomon said. "I left Firaxis on good terms and because this game [we're working on] feels like something that you almost need to build a studio around because it's so different. But then I left, and I think in my head, and honestly with me being an idiot, I thought I'd step out and the world would fight over funding me. And then I was like, "Oh sh*t. There's actually hardly any funding.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a really rough [time for the industry]. Very few things got funded last year and then of course all these <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">horrific layoffs and studio closures</a>. I didn't [leave Firaxis] as a result of it, but I think I definitely felt it."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, Solomon and his team had an idea that was ultimately a large part of why the studio got funded, according to the game director: creating an "emergent-story life sim." Billed as a competitor to Maxis' The Sims, the studio's currently untitled debut game is a life sim that focuses slightly less on cosmetic design in favor of deep storytelling. Solomon said he brought up The Sims series' lack of competitors to investors, as it feels like an oversight in the gaming industry that leaves a large demographic of gamers "underserved."</p><p dir="ltr">"I think part of the reason we got funded was our ability to say, 'Hey look, in the industry, if there was a game that was 25 years old, and was still this successful--I mean, they just announced in their earnings report yesterday that there are over 85 million players--but if it was <em>this</em> successful and their audience is <em>this</em> loyal, any other game in our industry would have a hundred competitors."</p><p dir="ltr">Solomon admits it might be weird to fans of his work to see him take up this cause, as he is primarily known as "the XCOM guy." However, this pivot actually makes a lot of sense. On top of being a longtime fan of life sims and learning under Sid Meier, a pioneer of the simulation genre, Solomon has been dabbling with life-sim elements for some time.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the surface, I'm sure it will seem like a weird jump to some people… I totally understand if people are like, 'Oh the XCOM guy?'" Solomon laughed. "Yet even on the last XCOM I designed, there was something called Soldier Bonds, where your soldiers formed relationships. And that was just dipping my pinky toe in it.</p><blockquote><p>"Then with Midnight Suns, I probably lavished way too much attention on my--let's face it--Marvel dating simulator. Which I always wanted to make, so I think that was a manifestation of mine.</p></blockquote><p>"But I've always thought that if you make system-based games, which I do, you can apply systems to almost everything… And this may be trite, but I have thought that conversation is basically turn-based combat."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>An emergent-story life sim</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Midsummer Studios' debut game is more of a "choose-your-own adventure" life sim than a traditional sandbox title, Solomon told me--though he was also quick to assure me that the game will feature a creative mode that emulates a more-traditional life sim, and allows players to exert more control over their town and its inhabitants. But as for its base game, Solomon said that rather than players creating several multi-character families, they will instead focus on creating a single character and living out their day-to-day life as them while a branching narrative takes them on a journey they help write.</p><p dir="ltr">"So Grant [Rodiek] is our executive producer and he was a director on The Sims for a long time. And he told me that most players play with a single Sim," Solomon explained. "So we have a main character that you are starting the story of.</p><p dir="ltr">"Then we do two things: We choose what storylines make sense and will be interesting to inject in your character's life, and then we also generate characters to cast around your main character and pre-seed them with relationships that make the story interesting. In that way, we're very different from something like The Sims. So if you were like, 'Hey, I'm trying to tell a story where I find my soulmate,' we would be like, 'Okay, well then here's your ex-lover and also they're your co-worker. Here's your high school boyfriend who is your neighbor, and here is your secret crush who is also your business rival.' ...And of course, you can edit those when we generate them. You can say, 'No, I don't want that or no, they don't look like that,' and edit whatever you want. But we want the player to step into a very story-rich environment even when they start the game."</p><p dir="ltr">From there, the game will ask players "leading questions" that allow players to author the story they want to tell, according to Solomon. One example he gave was a scenario in which a neighbor mentions to the player character that they saw their father in town. The player can then respond to this in a variety of ways, including telling the neighbor "I never want to see him again" or "Yeah, we're having a hard time getting over the loss of my mom so I'm trying to spend quality time with him." This then informs the game of what the player wants their relationship to look like, and kicks off a particular chain of events.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Shedding internal values</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Yet a challenge with this style of gameplay, Solomon told me, is emboldening players to take control of the story and make choices that are interesting rather than safe. However, enticing players to shed their "internal values" is not always an easy task. In choice-driven RPGs, for example, acting in more outlandish ways can, at best, make some players feel like they are deviating from the intended story. In the worst-case scenario, players can even feel punished by making these choices--such is the case with games like Fable, which alter your appearance based on your character's morality. The team is attempting to remedy this by incentivizing "high-conflict" actions with bigger rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">"For a story to be interesting, there has to be some element of surprise to it and it's tough when you're the author and also we need to surprise you. Since we can't inject surprises into your story, we also want the player to surprise themselves," Solomon said. "We're going to tell players, 'Hey, if you did something humorous in this situation, you're going to get a bigger reward right now. If you do something romantic, bigger reward. If you do something confrontational, bigger reward.' And it makes you as a player kind of stop and think like, 'Well, okay, fine. I will actually choose an option that's a little more humorous because the game is telling me in this case, I can be rewarded.'</p><p dir="ltr">"And this <em>is</em> a life sim, so you can do whatever you want, but we're kind of trying to entice the player to make small choices that are different than they would normally do [so] that they come back to the player in surprising ways. That way, every time you play, you get the player steered off in a direction that surprises themselves. The player is the first person that needs to be entertained by their story, so getting players to surprise themselves is something that I've really thought about in our design."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A town can be a character</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Another key component of Midsummer Studios' game design is the game's town. Solomon explained that he wants players to think of it as its own character, similar to Gilmore Girls' Stars Hollow.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"What I talk about more than anything else is Stars Hollow and Gilmore Girls. Stars Hollow is one of those places with such a strong sense of place--you want to go there," Solomon said.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">He added that the team also looked to Virgin River, Stephen King novels, and even British murder mysteries for inspiration--any location that is filled with characters who know one another and form strong relationships, even if they are hidden.</p><p dir="ltr">Discovering these hidden relationships and getting to know your neighbors is another feature that adds depth to the upcoming game. Solomon said that, while The Sims has meaningful moments, part of Midsummer Studios' goal was to elevate smaller situations that would have deep consequences in reality.</p><p dir="ltr">"With The Sims, you have all these moments: you have children, you get married, all those things. But then you also have [smaller scenarios] where you go to a party and you're like, 'My wife and our old neighbor are chatting so why am I seeing hearts go up? What the f*ck are you two doing?'" Solomon laughed. "We want the game to recognize that it's this elephant [in the room]."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A new wave of life sims</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">It was at this point I decided to address the elephant in <em>our</em> room. Though there has been a distinct lack of The Sims competitors in the past few decades, an influx of Sims-likes are on the horizon. Life By Solomon laughed and admitted he thought it was wild how so many studios seemingly had the same idea at once, but ultimately said he thinks it's a great thing for the genre.</p><p dir="ltr">"I genuinely believe that it's a good thing for there to be so many life sims. I mean, one of the special things about The Sims is it's so massive that it has multiple audiences. There are the people who do house building. There are people who go on Tumblr and post the screenshots of their characters and these stories that are so involved. They actually project a lot of story onto their characters, and those are probably the players that we're targeting. And then there's the Wicked Whims crowd… if you know, you know," Solomon joked. "But there's multiple audiences. And because they don't act like a normal core game audience, they're really underserved. It doesn't make any sense.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think more life sims will simply ignite interest in The Sims players who have been essentially resigned to the fact that there is only one way to fulfill this specific fantasy. The Sims players will see there are actually alternatives, and so I think it will help the community be rejuvenated. I can't see it as anything other than a net positive, and it helps us that the other life sims all have their own take on a life. We want to focus on the story you're telling. Injecting drama into a character's life that you have authorship over. We want you to feel like you are living inside of a story."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Release date</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Midsummer Studios does not yet have a title or release date for its upcoming life sim. That said, Solomon confirmed the studio is "prototyping right now" with the goal of releasing a demo next year. He added that the studio is "very fortunate" to be in a position where its employees don't feel pressured to think about a release date right now.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're funded and venture-capital-backed, which is new for me. And the nice thing about that is that you have the money up front, so we're able to over-communicate with our team and just say, 'This is the exact amount of money we have in the bank. This is our hiring plan, which means that we're all just fine until this date, so let's just focus on what we're working on.' And luckily our team can feel safe, which is not a given in this industry lately."</p>
