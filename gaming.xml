			<p>At the time of this writing, there are still just under 60 hours left in 2025, which means that the jury is still out on which game was the best-selling game of the year on the biggest PC storefront, Steam. That said, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025"><strong>Steam Charts</strong></a> has already declared the games that were part of the top 100 best-selling games by revenue on the platform, and while it doesn't list the titles in order, we know that some of the top 12 games include ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>At least that's the case for the list of new games released in 2025. When you look at top sellers across the platform, including games not released in 2025, the top 12 look more like what you'd expect, with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals making up almost half of the top 12.</p>



<p>As for the new releases, however, the top 12 make it clear that games with a multiplayer focus are still the majority of what sells on the platform, with 9/12 games either featuring multiplayer or having multiplayer as the core element. But that's not to say single-player experiences aren't selling or essential to what players are looking for today.</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening may be a multiplayer game, but you can experience so much of it without really interacting with other players. Hollow Knight Silksong is an entirely solo journey, as is The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, all of which made the top 12.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top 12 best-selling new games on Steam for 2025, sorted randomly:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule I</li>



<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Dune: Awakening</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable element to this list is what's left off, specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was able to make the next tier of best-selling games, but couldn't beat Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4, the two other first-person shooters you could argue are its biggest competition.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that, whatever your stance on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studio's use of GenAI</a>, it is incredibly impressive for ARC Raiders to arrive as a brand-new franchise and be one of the year's most popular, best-selling titles. ARC Raiders and Schedule I are the only two games that aren't based on a previously-existing franchise or series that made the list, and Schedule I's accomplishment is even more impressive when you factor in the fact that it's a self-published indie game.</p>



<p>The final tally will come after 2025 is officially over, and we'll get a list that's not in a random order once firms like Circana and Newzoo publish their findings. In the meantime, you can check out Wccftech's Best of 2025 lists, which include several of the top-selling games mentioned. Like Hollow Knight Silksong's appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Best Platformers</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie Games</a>, or ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 making the cut for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/">Best Multiplayer Games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kenneth-shepards-top-10-games-of-2025-pokemon-hundred-2000655496"><span>I loved </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but looking at a game in every stage of its development is inevitably going to make you wish a studio had been able to implement every idea it had into the final product. The infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span> from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>last year</span></a><span> has given us a pretty thorough look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> journey from design doc to finished game, and while it’s interesting to see these screenshots and pieces of test footage, it also has fans weighing in on Game Freak’s processes and sharing how they feel about the final product now that they’ve seen how the sausage was made.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdVmay2ky0"><span>TurtleBro</span></a><span> compiled all his findings in the Teraleak into a feature-length video that goes chronologically through </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s development files dating back to 2022, shortly after work on </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> had wrapped up. Some files are from so early in the process that Game Freak was using </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>’ Irida as a placeholder for the player. These screenshots and videos show some cut content and features, like additional building interiors to explore, being able to use overworld abilities around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, and even some additional multiplayer modes that had players throwing Poké Balls at one another, dodgeball style.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps most surprising in these early builds is a much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>higher level of environmental detail</span></a><span> than we see in the final game. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> was memed to hell and back for its flat-textured buildings, and some of the first pieces of footage TurtleBro shows off include windows and building structures that are much more detailed. In January of 2023, many of these assets were swapped for something similar to the flat ones we have in the game now, and internal notes suggest this downgrade was a “burden” on the team. It’s here you can see a lot of the game’s initial ambitions get pulled back, though some things, like the real-time, action-based combat system, started to take shape here, albeit in a more third-person shooter style than the command-based one we have now. By March of that year, the team was on track to deliver the game we got, and morale started to improve.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s one aspect of the development timeline that is kind of fascinating considering 2024 was the first time in quite a few years since there wasn’t a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><span>or expansion</span></a><span>: it sounds like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was feature complete by June 2024, and Game Freak spent around 16 months on polish before it launched the game on October 16, 2025. </span></p>

 <p><span>TurtleBro speculates that the reason the game’s visuals were deliberately downgraded was to give the team the year to spend refining the game in order to avoid a massive performance fiasco like the one that surrounded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> in 2022</span></a><span>, though others who viewed the game less charitably </span><a href="https://x.com/soulsilverart/status/2005368278689222901"><span>suspect Game Freak may have just shelved </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> for over a year and moved onto a new project, rather than using that time for meaningful iteration. It’s unclear, however, as the development details stop at this point; the Teraleak occurred in August, and thus, we don’t have any more of these design docs that might confirm the team’s thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overall, it’s a fascinating look at how </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> went from concept to finished game, and TurtleBro does a great job of comparing images of aspects of the game from early in development to what those aspects look and play like in the actual, released game you can play on your Switch or Switch 2. Check out the full video below:</span></p>

  <p><span>I do mourn some of the stuff we lost in the development process, but that’s the risk you take when you look at unfinished work. The video puts the leaks we’ve seen from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> into perspective, serving as a reminder that several of the mechanics and concepts those leaks have revealed may not make it into the final product, either. We’ll know for sure when those games are revealed, which will likely happen for the series’ 30th anniversary next year.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has sold its DRM-free PC storefront GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński, for 90.7 million Polish złoty (approx. $25.2 million). Kiciński is also co-founder of CD Projekt itself, and currently holds 10% of share capital in the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński co-founded GOG in 2008, and it has operated within the CD Projekt Group for over 17 years. Selling GOG “fits” CD Projekt’s long-term strategy, according to <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a FAQ posted online</a>. CD Projekt, the Polish company behind smash hits The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, wants to focus on video game development and other projects, it said. CD Projekt is currently developing The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Selling GOG fits CD Projekt’s long-term strategy,” reads the statement. “CD Projekt wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands. This deal lets CD Projekt keep that focus, while GOG gets stronger backing to pursue its own mission.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński commented: “From the very beginning, GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and I came up with the idea for GOG, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players and ensure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you — forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG will operate independently, it said, and continue with its DRM-free philosophy. Following the sale, CD Projekt and GOG signed a distribution agreement that specifies the terms of future cooperation, including a plan to release CD Projekt Red’s upcoming games on GOG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership,” Kiciński continued. “I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every CD Projekt Red Game In Development</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: “with our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes. We would like to thank the GOG team for years of fruitful cooperation and wish them all the best. And to the GOG community, I say ‘see you around,’ because our upcoming releases will naturally be available on GOG as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has long competed with Steam for the hearts and minds of PC gamers by leaning on its no-DRM policy, although Valve's platform remains the overwhelming market leader. In the FAQ, the question ‘is GOG financially unstable?’ is asked. The answer, officially, is no. “GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year,” reads the statement. “In fact, we’ve seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.” GOG hit the headlines recently for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">getting behind indie game Horses after Valve banned it from Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like from a user point of view, nothing changes here. As for CD Projekt, it can now strip out GOG from its business, which at latest count employed 1,335 staff. In The Witcher franchise it has the aforementioned The Witcher 4 as part of a new Witcher trilogy with Ciri as protagonist, The Witcher Remake, and Project Sirius. Cyberpunk 2 is also in development, as is Project Hadar, a new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/if-we-create-the-impression-that-using-ai-is-evil-it-could-seriously-hinder-the-progress-of-modern-digital-tech-says-level-5-ceo/</link>
            <guid>1393957</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Using <strong>Generative AI</strong> in game development has been, and will continue to be, a controversial topic for the foreseeable future. Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">backlash that hit Larian Studios following their CEO's admission to using GenAI</a> in the development of Divinity, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/">Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> losing one of its Game of the Year wins due to the studio using GenAI</a> in the game's development, it has once again been at the forefront of industry conversation. Now, Level-5 chief executive officer Akihiro Hino has weighed in with his view, prompted by Clair Obscur losing its GOTY win.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650">In a post shared on Hino's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, Hino outlines that, in his view, GenAI is able to provide "<em>time savings that can't be dismissed</em>," and that if we continue to build "<em>the impression that 'using AI is bad,' it could seriously hinder the progress of modern digital tech</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>今日はめずらしく、自分が作っているゲームの話ではないことを書きます。</p><p>【AIをめぐる騒動について】…</p></div>— 日野晃博 (@AkihiroHino) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hino begins by clarifying a point on GenAI surrounding one of Level-5's upcoming titles, after there were claims that the studio was letting generative AI do all the programming. The Professor Layton and Ni No Kuni developer is not doing that, according to Hino, and calls the whole thing a misunderstanding, saying, "<em>The truth of the matter is that there's an unreleased title themed around AI, and for that specific title, a programmer mentioned they're deliberately having AI handle the programming as well. They used that as an example to suggest that an era like that might be coming, and that's what got blown out of proportion</em>."</p>



<p>Hino then continues to share his viewpoint on GenAI, which emphasizes that the technology is a tool, and one that, ultimately, cannot be ignored.</p>



<p>"<em>AI is enabling time savings that can't be dismissed, and I believe this has the potential to upend common sense in game development. It might shift us from a world where developing the AAA games everyone wants to play takes 5-10 years to one where we get to enjoy them every two years. AI sometimes gets treated like it's synonymous with plagiarism, but a knife can be used for cooking or as a weapon; a computer can create games or enable cybercrime. AI might produce plagiarized content if misused, but if used properly, it has the power to enrich the creative world even further</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I want to see games evolve even more in my lifetime</em>," Hino continues. "<em>I want to experience and create dreamlike games that surpass the standards of today's AAA titles. If we let the impression take hold here that 'using AI is evil,' it could seriously hinder the advancement of modern digital technology. I hope creators and audiences alike can recognize 'AI' as a tool that people use to make their works. Here's to hoping that various technological innovations lead to even greater growth in the game industry!</em>"</p>

              <p>Like everything else that was once popular, the early 2000s Fox TV comedy <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> is returning in Spring 2026 with stars <a href="https://kotaku.com/shop-contest-frankie-muniz-winners-1838809743">Frankie Muniz</a>, Bryan Cranston, and Jane Kaczmarek all back to reprise their roles as Malcom, Hal, and Lois, respectively.</p> <p>On December 29, Disney and Hulu released the first trailer for <a href="https://people.com/frankie-muniz-malcolm-in-the-middle-reboot-trailer-exclusive-11875191"><em>Life’s Still Unfair</em></a>, an upcoming 4-episode<em> Malcom in the Middle</em> miniseries event set around 20 years after the original show, which ran from 2000 to 2006 on Fox. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>And here’s the official synopsis for the miniseries, which will be exclusively available on Hulu and Disney+:</p> <blockquote><p>“After shielding himself and his daughter from his family for over a decade, Malcolm is dragged back into their orbit when Hal and Lois demand his presence at their 40th anniversary party.”</p></blockquote> <p>As a young pre-teen in the early 2000s, I watched a lot of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> during the show’s original run on TV. But like a lot of people, according to ratings data, I remember my family vaguely checking out around season four. Two years later, the show was canceled due to low ratings. Of course, nostalgia for content from this era is reaching its highest point as people who grew up in that era are now entering their 30s. So Malcolm and his family will soon return to TV (or internet streaming TV) as Hollywood execs and number crunchers hope to squeeze out as much profit and viewership from this reheated revival as they can before they move on to the next somewhat popular TV show or movie from about 20 years ago.</p>

 <p>I love leftovers as much as the next guy, but I’m not sure I need every TV show and movie I grew up with to return for what often ends up being forgettable and tired reunions. Anyway, <em>Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair</em> will premiere on Hulu and Disney+ on April 10, 2026. Regardless of how I feel about the revival, the show’s opening song still kicks ass.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Isn’t Clair Obscur, It’s A Remake Of An 18-Year-Old Chinese RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-chinese-rpg-sword-fairy-trailer-remake-2000655947</link>
            <guid>1393918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> vibes from the new trailer for <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, you’re not alone. Some are pointing to the upcoming RPG as evidence that we’re about to get lot of copycats trying to ape the 2025 Game of the Year’s aura, similar to the wave of open-world games that borrowed elements from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>after that game’s incredible success. But <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t spring up out of nowhere, and the series it’s a part of has a long history of its own.</p> <p>“This single-player&nbsp;turn-based RPG is reborn in Unreal Engine 5 with the latest technology,” publisher CubeGame <a href="https://twitter.com/CubeGameCN/status/2005594647792656573">announced on Monday</a>. “Set off on a journey to find the immortals with Tianhe Yun’s team. In the meantime, a hidden truth that has been sealed for a long time is revealing itself.” The update was accompanied by a fresh trailer that’s been turning heads for both its high production values and its flashy turn-based combat.</p>

  <p>That last part is the biggest reason why the game’s been drawing comparisons to <em>Clair Obscur</em>. Like this year’s hit RPG, <em>Sword and Fairy 4:</em> <em>Remake</em> seems to feature cinematic battle animations with lots of motion blur and slowdown, as well as a command wheel integrated into the scene rather than situated off to the side with the rest of the HUD. The fact that the whole thing is in Unreal Engine 5 adds another level of hyper-realistic sheen reminiscent of <em>Clair Obscur</em>.</p>

 <p>But while the internet has a penchant for condensing new stuff down into familiar buzz phrases and using the most popular things as lenses for understanding everything else, <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. Quoting one site’s post about the game that called it a “<em>Clair Obscur</em>-like,” <em>The CRPG Book </em>editor <a href="https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/">Felipe Pepe</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3mb4tg7zfjk2v">wrote</a>, “I really hate how games media handles anything out of China. We’re getting a gorgeous remake of one of their best RPGs ever, but the clown does zero research about it and just goes ‘I’m getting a lot of Boss Baby vibes from this…'”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The original Sword and Fairy 4 looked like this, the second screenshot is the remake, and the third is Expedition 33.  </p> <p>The only bar you have to clear is to recognize shape and colors at this point, and you are failing miserably. My 3-year old cousin can see the similarities <a href="https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV">https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV</a> <a href="https://t.co/0X9sXdrz9o">pic.twitter.com/0X9sXdrz9o</a></p> <p>— Dream's Longest Day (@Dreamboum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/2005678913092231639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The first <em>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</em> launched for MS-DOS in 1995 and served as an analogue to <em>Final Fantasy</em> rooted in Chinese mythology, but it was never localized outside of East Asia. The most recent entry was 2021’s <em>Sword and Fairy 7</em> which abandoned turn-based combat for real-time action and is available on both PC and console. <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, meanwhile, is an update to the 2007 entry which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/">also happens to be available on Steam</a>. It only looks like<em> Clair Obscur</em> to the degree that all turn-based battle RPGs have you similarly watching a static row of fighters enact the commands you select from a menu.</p>

 <p>It’s definitely possible that <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> developer UP software has leaned into some of the stylistic RPG design choices we now associate with <em>Clair Obscur</em> in the year since that game blew up (trailers for it were getting fans hyped well before its 2025 release, too). But <em>Clair Obscur</em> owes some of those elements, including its flashy command wheel, to series that came before it, like <em>Persona</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">As RPG fans have been reminding each other a lot this year</a>, the genre extends well beyond <em>Final Fantasy</em> and a certain modern French riff on the franchise.</p>

 <p>Maybe <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will be the latest one to help players continue to expand their turn-based horizons.</p>

While I've been covering it as a journalist and critic for over a decade now, 2025 has been particularly brutal and antagonistic against creatives around the world. I've lost count of how many stories about layoffs I wrote. The corporate buzzwords from CEOs celebrating milestones at the end of financial quarters while people had lost their livelihoods days prior are forever present in my mind.

            <p>Peak developer Aggro Crab has hit back at "friendslop" haters, insisting there's a place for co-op games that "deliver a specific experience", especially as they can be "very cost-effective for indie production".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/peak-lead-knows-youre-a-friendslop-hater-but-remember-these-games-arent-trying-to-be-game-of-the-year-these-are-games-that-emphasize-teamwork/">GamesRadar+</a>, studio head Nick Kaman said that while these games may "forego traditional quality markers", some players just want to hang out with their friends and have fun – and that's what "friendslop games put [...] at the front and centre of the experience".</p>

<p>"There's backlash because sometimes these games forego traditional quality markers like polished graphics or story, but these games aren't trying to be Game of the Year, they focus on delivering a specific experience and that can make it very cost-effective for indie production," Kaman said.</p><p>While he acknowledges that "like with any hot genre, you get a lot of fast-follows and low-quality attempts flooding the storefronts", he reckons "it's mainly just fun to be a hater, especially when a term like 'friendslop' is so juicy".</p>
<p>"There's a real desire to connect and hang out in online worlds, and friendslop games put that at the front and centre of the experience," Kaman added. "These are games that emphasise teamwork and communication, as opposed to just testing your individual skill in a group setting."</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p>
<p>It's been so successful, in fact, that it has spawned so many clones, the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-hit-co-op-climber-peak-sells-another-million-as-studio-outlines-future-update-plans">indie hit </a>would rather its community <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">pirate its own game than play a "microtransaction-riddled" ripoff</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="c7905b15e134e"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7905b15e134e/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you think more games should be about giving cursed skulls to weird strangers, then I'm here to tell you that you're fine, you're normal, you're <em>right</em>, and you should play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>.</p>
<p>You may have already played Bad Viking's first game in the 'Strange' series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, a gothically-tinged tale of running a plant shop, but with more than a touch of Lovecraftian business lurking in the shadows. As someone who's a little bored of the more toothless cosy games on the market, I'm always delighted to find something with sinister undercurrents and supernatural goings-on. Also, ritual murder! Not enough cosy games feature ritual murder.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xuvoji&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Strange Antiquities might be more of the same after Horticulture, but it's a great formula. People come in, they tell you their woes, and you use your logical and deductive skills to locate the object on your shelves that will solve their problems.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6842ca14e81eb"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6842ca14e81eb/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clever thing is that your shelves are filled with a ton of objects that could, potentially, fit the vague description in the book, and it takes careful reading and attention to clues to pick the right one. If you're looking for something made of gold, should you pick the necklace, or the totem? If you need something that represents a lunar goddess, should you pick an item made in her image, or in the shape of the moon? For detective game sickos like me (and you, I bet) who love having to decipher cryptic clues like you're trying to ask Rumpelstiltskin for directions, this is basically catnip.</p>
<p>Strange Antiques also has that rare quality of making the player feel masterful, which is hard to achieve, because the player usually has absolutely <em>zero</em> experience doing whatever it is the game's about. I love <strong>Ace Attorney</strong>, but I know diddly squat about the law, and although I technically have grown vegetables in my real-life garden, my harvest has never been as bountiful or marketable as those I grow in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've never been a semi-magical purveyor of arcane goods who occasionally explores graveyards and ruins to find more (although if you see a job posting for that, please send it to me), but Strange Antiquities – with all its reference tomes and maps – makes me feel incredibly competent at the task. A customer comes in, says something unhelpfully ambiguous about their ailment, and waits patiently as I comb through my books, cross-reference them with items, and finally settle on an object to give them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="43c04ae1d9981"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43c04ae1d9981/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're not giving out curios and knicknacks, you're exploring, through Strange Antiquities' concise and clever daily riddles. Some of these riddles are presented as text – "An escaped prisoner ran north-west. He hid me in the first building he came to" – which require you to find a location on a map that corresponds to its clues. In that example, you have to find a prison, trace a line northwest, and find the first building on that line. That one's easy, because it's the first one, but it still has that fulfilling sense of reading between the lines that all good detective games cultivate.</p>
<p>Other riddles are more opaque, providing you with nothing but a shape, and hoping that you'll have studied your maps enough to recognise that it's the outline of a house, or a tombstone, or a room. These puzzles need you to notice subtle details, read between the lines, and cultivate an internal spatial understanding of each area, in order to solve the riddle. Asking players to engage with the world on such an intimate level is genius – it creates a sense of player-directed immersion that adds to that feeling of mastery and ownership.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that, in a year dominated by detective-y puzzle-y games, most of which are not on the Switch (boo), I feel like Strange Antiquities has flown a little under the radar. The much-lauded clique of <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong>The Roottrees are Dead</strong>, <strong>The Drifter</strong>, <strong>The Seance of Blake Manor</strong>, <strong>Type Help</strong>, and the various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rise_of_the_golden_idol">Golden Idol</a> add-ons deserve their praise, but Strange Antiquities deserves to be up there on the puzzle podium with them. It's tough when the competition is so stiff!</p>
<p>So, if you're reading this and you enjoy clues and riddles and all that business, give Strange Antiquities a go (plus Strange Horticulture, if you haven't already played it). And then add it to your Game of The Year list, because it's certainly earned a place on mine. And it's not just because a strange shopkeeper gave me a <em>Purified Amulet Of GOTY</em>. I don't think, anyway.</p>

<p><em>Have you taken up the desk in Strange Antiquities and spent hours solving riddles and mysteries? Get thinking and tell us what you think of the game in the comments</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GOG Stands for Freedom, Independence, and Genuine Control’, Says Michał Kiciński, the GOG Co-Founder Who Just Acquired the Digital Store from CD Proj]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/</link>
            <guid>1393888</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Co-founder of CD Projekt RED and of Good Old Games (GOG), Michał Kiciński, has just acquired the digital storefront from CD Projekt RED. Kiciński, CDPR, and GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/">announced the news today in a blog post on the official GOG Blog</a>, as Kiciński promises to keep the founding values of GOG at the forefront of how the store operates.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control," </em>Kiciński said. That was the bedrock of the store when Kiciński and Marcin Iwiński founded the store over a decade ago, and that seems to be the same mission statement that is carrying the platform into this new era, as control returns to one of the platform's original co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG is entering a new chapter. Michał Kiciński</em>, <em>co-founder of CD Projekt and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD Projekt</em>," the platform announced on its <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375">official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever. Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library you control rather than one that controls you, and offering the most gamer-friendly policies on the market.</em>" </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In the blog post, an FAQ outlines how players don't have to do or change anything about their account, and that there is essentially no change for them on the user side. "<em>DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever</em>," the blog post reads, and the platform will also maintain its strong relationship with CD Projekt RED and continue to release CDPR games on the platform.</p>



<p>The platform also clarified that it is not in a bad way financially, and for the platform, this move is more about keeping the platform's core values at the forefront and protecting the platform through this independence.</p>



<p>"<em>To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Altogether, while this acquisition still has a great deal of significance in the fact that one of the more popular digital storefronts for PC players is changing hands, it doesn't feel like a major change at all, considering who it is going to and what will change about the platform going forward. GOG will remain the best place to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">grab older titles through its preservation efforts</a>, to find <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">premium mods like Fallout: London</a>, and the place <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-at-last-minute-steam-ban/">where games like Horses can thrive on</a> while other platforms ban it from sale.</p>

Like the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191794/gb-operator-game-boy-camera-webcam-epilogue-nintendo">GB Operator</a> that debuted in early 2021, the SN Operator is a standalone USB cartridge slot that lets you play and archive old Nintendo console games on PCs, Macs, or handhelds like the Steam Deck using their original carts. But where the GB Operator was built for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and GBA games, the SN Operator instead supports any Super Nintendo and Super Famicom game.</p><p>Preorders for the SN Operator will open at 12PM ET on December 30th for $59.99. That’s $10 more expensive than the smaller <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator">GB Operator</a>, which will remain available too. The hardware is expected to ship in April 2026.</p><p>The cartridge slot connects to computers or handhelds over USB and works alongside Epilogue’s accompanying <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/downloads">Playback</a> app. The app features a built-in SNES emulator for playing your original cartridges, but you can use other emulators if you already have one you prefer. Games that relied on accessories like Nintendo’s Super NES Mouse or the Super Scope are also compatible with Playback and will use your computer mouse instead of those peripherals.</p><p>On top of new console support, the SN Operator includes another function that should appeal to retro gaming fans with large collections of aging and degrading cartridges. The Playback app can authenticate cartridges so you know for sure if that rare title you found at a flea market is real or a bootleg. It can also create digital copies of your cartridges including their save game data so you can archive your collection and keep on playing where you originally left off, even if your original cartridges stop working. The SN Operator will work with any cartridge that can be played in Nintendo’s original hardware, including bootlegs you accidentally purchased. But Epilogue does specify you should only back up cartridges you own — so no using this to borrow and copy a giant collection from a friend.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850793/epilogue-sn-operator-super-nintendo-snes-cartridge-slot-backup-emulator]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> is nearly over, with its finale set to premiere on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-acquisition-batman-hbo-2000651036"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> and in theaters on Wednesday, December 31. Its penultimate episode, “Chapter Seven: The Bridge,” included a scene that was a long time coming: Will (Noah Schnapp) finally coming out to his friends as gay after crushing hard on Mike (Finn Wolfhard). It turns out Will’s identity isn’t merely a footnote on his character sheet, but actually ends up playing a pretty major part in the show’s supernatural horror elements. Now, after years of keeping the truth to himself, Will has finally told all his friends and a few acquaintances who were just kinda around that he is a card-carrying boy liker, and the final scene has received a pretty…mixed response.</span></p> <p><span>So let’s break it down. Will, who has a psychic connection with series big bad Vecna, is in his feelings after finding out the monster has been using him as a spy since he returned from the&nbsp; Upside Down in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ first season. He also learns that his connection to this other world created the Upside Down tunnel system that formed underneath Hawkins National Laboratory in season 2, which “infected” the real world and led to the deaths of many innocent people.</span></p>

 <p><span>Later in the episode, he tells his mother about Vecna’s hostile takeover of his mind, and says that the villain sees “everything,” knowing his secrets and preying on his fears. So in order to beat Vecna, Will says he needs to give him one less secret to wield, and wants his friends and family to know the truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Will sits down with a dozen people of varying importance to him and gives, well, a pretty straightforward coming-out confession of the sort that you’d expect from just about any well-meaning show from the early 2000s. He goes on about how he and all his friends are still the same except for one little detail: “I don’t like girls.” He says that he had a crush on someone he knew wouldn’t like him back, and that Vecna showed him a manufactured future in which this came between him and his friends, not because of bigotry, but because their overbearing worry for him makes him feel othered to the point of pushing them away.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As Will starts to cry, his mother and friends, one by one, promise that they’re not going anywhere and then give him a big group hug. It’s sweet, but maybe a bit overwrought for modern sensibilities? There’s a lot to unpack about this moment and how it may or may not land.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so fucking absurd I can’t <a href="https://t.co/XkOJQEhjkL">pic.twitter.com/XkOJQEhjkL</a></p> <p>— َ (@janehopz) <a href="https://twitter.com/janehopz/status/2004430176176984386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>For some, there’s just some absurdity to seeing most of the cast of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>lined up to listen to Will tell everyone he has a crush on another friend in the room, and it also doesn’t help that much of the cast is just not reacting much at all to the revelation. But I don’t think that the silliness of the scene is the only issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>By 2025, it feels like some queer people may have become a bit jaded toward the traditional coming-out story. It’s certainly still a universal part of queer experience, but when it’s often the only lens through which mainstream media views the queer experience, a young twink tearfully telling his bros he’s “still the same” as he always was probably isn’t going to land with queer viewers the way it once would have. On the contrary, some queer people don’t find comfort in stories where a gay character only finds solidarity if they focus on how they are the “same” as their cishet friends. I’d rather see stories about that support not being given under the condition of what makes me similar to others, when it should be offered regardless.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the case of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, I think I’m willing to offer it some grace because it is ultimately an ‘80s period piece, and even though the Stonewall Riots happened nearly 20 years prior, there was still a lot of work to be done in 1987. So if 16-year-old Will has no other framework to communicate his truth to his friends in the late ‘80s, fair enough. Especially if there are still young people living in small towns like Hawkins who are watching shows like </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> and still at that stage in their lives.</span></p> <p><span>That said, the ‘80s setting does have some fans wondering where the hell this universal acceptance is coming from. Yeah, you could argue the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>gang has been through so much that they don’t have time for homophobia, but when has an apocalypse ever been enough to make a bigot admit to the error of their ways? I don’t know, it’s an awkward line to walk when you’re including queer characters in your story. If you show a completely accepting universe, you run the risk of coming off as inauthentic, but if you portray the reality of the queer experience, you will inevitably have the most online armchair consultant calling your work a moral failing to the gays you hope to represent. Everyone’s got their preferences, but as hokey as the scene might be, I have a hard time viewing it as anything other than well-meaning.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the concept of having like 10 people in a room in the 1980’s, coming out to them, and not a singular one is homophobic 😭 </p> <p>no shade is that why erica wasn’t in the scene 😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/qNfAzccG1f">https://t.co/qNfAzccG1f</a></p> <p>— Base (@outsoldnation) <a href="https://twitter.com/outsoldnation/status/2004580048809123856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The bigger problem I have with the scene is one many people are having with </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season, which is that the writing is so straightforward and inelegant that you have to wonder if Netflix is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>actually telling writers to dumb down their work</span></a><span> for the people who are always on their damn phones. </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>has reasonably complex mythology and lore, so I don’t think anyone who’s still invested after five seasons needs to have dialogue mashed up and spoonfed to them like they’re a baby, but that proclivity feels pretty apparent in this scene. At the very least, the polarizing moment has got the shitpost pipeline flowing.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[BetterVR Mod Lets You Experience Breath of the Wild in VR, And You Should Grab It Before Nintendo Tries to Kill It]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five years ago, in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a developer known as Crementif started to work on a VR mod so they could cut down trees in the <strong>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>. After they figured out how to cut down trees in VR in Breath of the Wild, they kept working on it, and that initial idea became <strong>BetterVR</strong>, a full VR mod for Breath of the Wild that will let you experience the expansive world of Hyrule for the first time all over again. Until Nintendo tries to kill it, that is.</p>



<p>A trailer for the mod was released by Crementif and Flat2VR Studios just two days prior to its release today, announcing the mod and showcasing just how impressive it is - and it is incredibly impressive. The mod <a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR">is currently available to download</a>, and it works with a copy of Breath of the Wild for the Wii U that has been emulated and can run on your PC through Cemu version 2.6.</p>



<p>Though, as comments on the trailer and everywhere else Crementif's story has been shared point out, you'll want to get your hands on this mod and get it set up before Nintendo tries to kill it with their legal team. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Zelda BOTW VR Mod Trailer - Releasing In 2 Days!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDuxoo0kNsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo's litigious history is well known, whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">it is striking down entire emulators</a>, mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/">for games like Breath of the Wild</a>, or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-patent-on-summoning-and-battling-characters-re-examination-by-us-patent-office/">stretch the meaning of a patent to take out major competitors in the industry</a>. It wouldn't be a surprise if Flat2VR Studios and Crementif were contacted by Nintendo soon, if they haven't already.</p>



<p>Of course, Nintendo will not necessarily go after this mod over the scores of mods available for Breath of the Wild - <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-modded-ray-tracing/">like this one that adds ray tracing and makes the eight-year-old game look brand new</a> -  it's just something that's always a concern when projects like this pop up. So, in the meantime, if you have the necessary hardware and know-how to set this mod up for yourself, you'd do well to get it downloaded and ready, just in case something happens to it.</p>

<p>In an accompanying FAQ, the GOG team says Kiciński wants to "preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG", namely to "preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow".</p><p>The team says that nothing about your GOG account or library will change, and that games released on the platform will remain free of DRM. Not only that, but your tips and GOG Patron contributions won't be shared with Kiciński or "any other party".</p><p>Contrary to what you might think this means, GOG says it isn't "financially unstable"; quite the contrary, in fact. The team says it's "had a really encouraging year" and that gamers have shown "more enthusiasm" towards its preservation mission than ever before.</p><p>In short, then, it sounds like nothing about the material GOG experience will change for you, but that ownership has shifted from <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>The Witcher </em>parent company CD Projekt to a single individual.</p>

              <p>After nearly 20 years of operation, digital video game storefront GOG is no longer a part of <em>Witcher 3 </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. It is now fully owned by one of CDPR’s co-founders who also helped launch GOG.</p> <p>On December 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/pressroom/cd-projekt-co-founder-michal-kicinski-acquires-gog-from-cd-projekt/">CDPR announced via a press release</a> that its Steam-like storefront, GOG, has been fully acquired by CDPR co-founder Michał Kiciński. As part of the deal, Kiciński now owns 100 percent of GOG’s shares after purchasing them for 90 million PLN or about 25 million USD. The deal didn’t involve the co-founder selling any of his shares in CDPR.</p> <p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,”&nbsp;said GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski.&nbsp;“In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>

 <p>Launched in October 2008, GOG (originally known as Good Old Games) was started as a place for retro games to be sold by various publishers and developers. The store offers titles with no DRM and has since expanded greatly, selling new and old games while also <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">starting an ambitious preservation program</a> to help keep dated games running on modern hardware without publisher support.</p>

 <p>As to why CDPR is selling GOG now, joint CEO Michał Nowakowski says the company has an “<em>ambitious development roadmap”</em> and plans to expand the studio’s franchises, so it made sense to split GOG off and let CDRP focus on its own projects.</p>

 <p>“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes,<em>“</em> said Nowakowski.</p>

 <p>While CDPR will no longer own GOG, it confirmed plans to continue to release its new games on the digital storefront. So, at least for now, it seems like nothing will be changing for players as GOG goes fully independent.</p>

            <guid>1393846</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">The trend of most software companies in the last decade has been to switch operations over to a subscription-based model, where you pay monthly for access to the latest features and updates. Microsoft, for example, offers its Office suite through Microsoft 365, which requires an ongoing monthly payment. While this model keeps you up to date with the newest software and app updates, it also means you’re committing to paying for it forever. There’s something much more appealing to just paying for a thing once and then owning it, which is why this Microsoft Office deal is very exciting. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/">For a limited time, StackSocial is offering Microsoft Office 2024 Home for both Windows and Mac at a significant discount—up to 40% off.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="546">The offer includes doesn’t include the full Microsoft Office suite, just the big three. That’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can get the 2024 versions of this software for just $120 for a limited time. That’s down 20% from $150, saving your $30. If you really need Outlook as well, perhaps operating a small business out of home and are looking for alternatives to Gmail, then you can get the Home &amp; Business bundle which adds on Outlook to the other three. That package is 40% off which brings it from $250 to just $150.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6602/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2 data-start="548" data-end="585"><strong data-start="548" data-end="585">One-Time Payment, Lifetime Access</strong></h2>
<p data-start="1500" data-end="1745">This is the 2024 suite for Microsoft Office applications. They come with a lot of helpful features unique to 2024 and later versions. PowerPoint for instance now lets user record presentations from within the app. You can record voice, video, and closed captions. This is wonderful for teachers uploading courses for online classes as well as really any business presentation that’d be helpful to be able to reference back to later again and again.</p>


<p data-start="1747" data-end="2244">Once you purchase the software, you can immediately download and install it. After completing your order, you will receive an email with your software license keys and download links. The license is tied to your Microsoft Account—not your actual device—and is a one-time use code. Be sure to redeem your software within seven days of purchase, as all sales are final once the license is activated. Unredeemed licenses can be returned within seven days for a refund.</p>
<p data-start="2246" data-end="2621">If you’re setting up a new laptop or desktop and want to avoid the hassle of monthly fees, this is what you want over Microsoft 365. For just $120, you can get lifetime access to the 2024 versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. You can add in Outlook for just $30 more. The deal is available to both Windows and Mac users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you really liked the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">this year’s <em>Silent Hill f</em></a> and are still craving more foggy survival horror, well, I’ve got some good news for you. Konami has no plans to slow down now and wants to release at least one game a year in the series moving forward. Nothing bad ever happens when a franchise becomes annual, right?</p> <p>In a recent interview with <em><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923">Famitsu</a>,</em> <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">as translated by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto talked about the franchise’s current state and claimed that after releasing two critically acclaimed best-selling <em>Silent Hill</em> games in the last two years, the franchise is “back on track.” And it now sounds like we’ll be returning to the foggy streets of Silent Hill about once a year, assuming everything goes to plan.</p>

 <p>“Including both announced and unannounced [<em>Silent Hill</em> games], we’re aiming for a release pace of about one title per year,” Okamoto told <em>Famitsu</em> in its end-of-the-year issue. “I’m not sure how much of that we’ll be able to realize, but I’ll continue to do my best as producer of the <em>Silent Hill</em> series. Ideally, we’d like to keep excitement around the <em>Silent Hill</em> series going at all times. We’re working hard to share new updates, so I’d appreciate it if you could wait just a little longer.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Before the excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake in October 2024</a>, the survival horror franchise had fallen into disrepair, with very few new entries, and the few games that did arrive were generally disappointing. Remember 2023’s <em>Silent Hill Accession</em>, that interactive livestream…thing? Bleh. And before that, the last real <em>Silent Hill</em> game we got was <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-downpour-made-you-the-monster-1832640116">2012’s <em>Downpour</em></a>, a forgettable and bland horror game that basically put the series on ice for a decade.</p>

 <p>Now, in 2025 and after two great games,<em> Silent Hill</em> is in a great place, and while I’m nervous about it becoming an annual franchise, I think <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and <em>f</em> show a path forward that could make this work. If different studios are brought in and allowed to play around with the franchise’s past as well as take it in new directions, we might be in for a golden age of <em>Silent Hill</em> games. And that seems to be Konami’s plan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-remake-2-f-bloober-team-cronos-2000630590">with a <em>Silent Hill 1</em> remake</a> in development as well as <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202">a mysterious project, <em>Townfall.</em></a> Or maybe the franchise is about to fly off the rails again.</p>

Even the camera perspective and the way the camera moves during battle rekindles memories of Sandfall Interactive’s hugely popular RPG.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Sword and Fairy 4 Remake - Official Trailer “Unpredictable Divine Will” is here!

The first game launched in 1995 for PC and enjoyed critical and commercial success across China. Many sequels and spinoffs have followed in the years since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Sword and Fairy 4 is in fact the fifth installment in the mainline video game franchise, and acts as a prequel to the third game. The latest game, The Legend of Sword and Fairy 7, came out in 2021 as the ninth mainline entry on PC, with an English version released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S in 2022 under the name Sword and Fairy: Together Forever. It was seen as an alternative to the recent mainline Final Fantasy games, which of course inspired Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s development.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are drawing a line from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to Sword and Fairy 4 Remake, and some are accusing its developer of copying Sandfall’s game. “Totally not copy and paste combat, style, parry, from Clair Obscur Expedition 33,” said one commenter. "Is this DLC of Expedition 33?" said another. "We got Expedition-like genre now," added another fan. Others, however, are saying Sword and Fairy 4 Remake just looks like a modern turn-based RPG in the Persona style, and are pointing to previous entries in the series as evidence of its credentials.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The first E33-like is already on its way from China and it's through the announcement of the remake of "Legend of Sword and Fairy 4". <a href="https://t.co/jfiVnNn42X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jfiVnNn42X</a></p>— Dream's Longest Day (@Dreamboum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/2005499063819800626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Cube Game has said an English version of the trailer will be revealed in the coming days by a “regional publisher.” We’ll hopefully learn more about Sword and Fairy 4 Remake then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, meanwhile, is enjoying a new surge of interest off the back of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">a record-breaking haul from The Game Awards 2025</a>, where it took home the coveted Game of the Year.

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering - making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much," Kiciński said.</p><p>"As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026."</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: "With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move. For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it's going into very good hands - we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG's co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes."</p>
<p>As part of the deal, GOG has signed a distribution agreement with CD Projekt, including a plan to release all CD Projekt Red's upcoming games on GOG.</p>
<p>GOG is, of course, one of few digital distributors that permitted Santa Ragione's controversial horror, Horses, to go on sale. Following Valve and Epic Game Stores' decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses</a>, rival storefront GOG weighed in, saying it wanted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them-steam-rival-gog-weighs-in-amid-horses-ban-controversy">"to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them</a>."</p><p>GOG also fights to preserve games. Announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">Preservation Program</a> in November last year, the company said it wants to maintain the compatibility of games with modern and future systems. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">GOG also joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</a> (EFGAMP) as it continues to push for game preservation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Hopefully, many of you are enjoying an end-of-year break over the holidays, but even if you're back at the coalface before the new year arrives, we recommend making time to check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvpRGibFhg">this fascinating new overview documentary</a> of the NES' US launch from Frank Cifaldi and the folks over at the Video Game History Foundation.</p>
<p>Building on his years of research, and following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA">the excellent panel</a> at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo back in October (featuring NOA veterans Gail Tilden, Lance Barr, and Bruce Lowry - we'll embed the archived video at the bottom of the page), this new 45-minute video went live on Christmas Day and explores the ins and outs of the Famicom's journey to the US, its transformation into the Nintendo Entertainment System, and how its New York test market launch set the system up for monster success in the second half of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Cifaldi presents a condensed timeline of events, bringing together materials from the VGHF's archive with other sources for a brilliant, fresh look at a story you may think you know well. Starting when an initial deal with Atari fell through, which led to Minoru Arakawa and his Nintendo of America team wondering if they themselves had the means and wherewithal to bring the system to the US, Cifaldi highlights discouraging feedback from various rounds of focus group testing and advice, which NOA thankfully ignored.</p>
<p>Nintendo fans may believe there's nothing new to say about this much-told story, but the VGHF team does a great job of working in new tidbits and putting the record straight on points you <em>think</em> you know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d2cf678c1256a"><a title="NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2cf678c1256a/nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, yes, Lance Barr headed the industrial design for the Westernised Famicom hardware (using Bang &amp; Olufsen's sleek hi-fi gear as inspiration for the shell), but did you know that the thick 'brick' we all know and love — well, we all know it, at least — was actually the work of NCL's engineers riffing on Barr's efforts?</p>
<p>The team at Nintendo's Japanese parent company, worried about dust getting into the slot of a top-loading console, took Barr's sexier, B&amp;O-inspired design (known as the AVS before it became the NES) and bulked it out massively to include the front-loading cart mechanism. Barr himself was disappointed with the resulting 'lunchbox' when it appeared.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>did</em> know that already, you're guaranteed to find new info in the essay. The 45 minutes fly by, it ties up the opening Atari thread beautifully at the end, and we highly recommend settling down with it between now and the new year.</p>
<p>And if you're so inclined, head over to <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">gamehistory.org/donate</a> to find the VGHF's Winter Fundraiser and support Frank and the team's excellent work.</p>

<p>It's time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Well, not really. The massively popular Switch will live on in a way few other Nintendo consoles have done thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility</a>, a host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free upgrades to existing games</a>, and a Switch 2 form factor that keeps everything about the previous console.

<p>However, assuming the games play as advertised and the upscaling doesn't bork 720p games on Switch 2's 1080p screen, then a great many of us will be retiring our trusty console - or donating it to someone else.</p>
<p>After eight long years, it's an emotional time, so we thought we'd take a look back at the system — or <em>systems</em> (the replacements, the Lites, the OLEDs we've added to the family) — that kept us going since 2017, though good and bad, sickness and health, 'til Switch 2 us part.</p>
<p>Let's take one last look at the Switches Nintendo Lifers will be packing away very soon...</p>
<h2>A life Switch-up (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4c77861eeb56e"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c77861eeb56e/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My floor isn't always this messy... — <em><span></span> Image: Alana Hagues / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's weird to think that I almost didn't get a Switch straight away. I felt burned by the Wii U's launch, so I was tentative about picking up another launch-day console. Then I got home from work on 3rd March 2017 and there was my mum, with a shiny new boxed Nintendo Switch and a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. The Switch was my very first 'adult' console — as in, it was the first new console I owned as an adult. And in the eight years since, I've had two OG models, a Lite, and three different OLEDs.</p>
<p>Those Switches have been my rock. I took my OG to two separate E3s. It was my companion for many plane and train rides. The Switch was there through a break-up, buying my first apartment, through the-year-we-don't-talk-about, waiting for me post-therapy. Importantly, my OLED was there for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_party_superstars">Mario Party</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> sessions during my long-distance relationship, and it's here now after my move to America to live with my partner.</p>
<p>We have two OLEDs between us, so while one will probably be tucked away, the other will stay out for now. I can't quite say goodbye to the console just yet. I may reserve a lot of love for older systems, but the Switch is one of my favourites. I'm not sure I would be doing what I do now at Nintendo Life without the Switch. So, thank you, you lovely little tablet, you.</p>
<h2>Man's second-best friend (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6354d090c70ca"><a title="TEDDY" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6354d090c70ca/teddy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"What you doing, Dad?" — <em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think I've gone through quite as many milestones in life as I have during the Switch's lifespan. Okay, granted, not many console generations have lasted as long as the Switch, but whatever.</p>
<p>Soon after March 2017, I moved into my first house with my then-girlfriend, who became my wife a few years later. We got a dog (Teddy, who some of you will have met in a few Nintendo Direct liveblogs), created a brand-new human, moved into a bigger home, and I started working my dream job here at Nintendo Life. Honestly, I owe the Switch a great deal.</p>
<figure data-uuid="036c05beb3449"><a title="Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/036c05beb3449/switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the 3DS, which wooed me with its excellent custom designs, I've stuck to owning just one of each Switch variant: the OG, the Lite, and the OLED. The original has, until now, festered in the garage after I haphazardly threw it in a box whilst moving house, and unfortunately it no longer charges. A regrettable action on my part.</p>
<p>My Lite has pretty much already gone to my daughter, and while she's still not quite old enough to understand how it all works, it'll be there for her in the coming months and years. As for the OLED, I dunno... I suspect I'll keep it as a kind of backup; something to potentially test out GameShare features in the future, or something. I'm hesitant to let it go.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is... thank you, Switch. Nostalgia keeps the GameCube pretty high up on my list of favourite consoles, but there's no denying that the Switch is probably Nintendo's greatest achievement.</p>
<h2>So long, partner (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9880cdf03ad8f"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9880cdf03ad8f/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, that's how shocked I am that it's almost over — <em><span></span> Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It comes as a shock to almost everyone that I tell, but I didn't get my first Switch until Christmas 2017. I was in my first year of uni at the time and, unsurprisingly, I didn't have a lot of spare money lying around to be splashing on the latest Zelda machine. And so, I patiently waited until ol' Saint Nick came a-calling, while the lineup grew and grew.</p>
<p>Over the next three years of studying, the console brought some of my happiest memories: Wrapping up Breath of the Wild in my gross student bedroom rather than dwelling on homesickness; pulling an all-nighter with my housemates to finish a collaborative runthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shaq-fu_a_legend_reborn">Shaq-Fu</a> (of all the games); sweating buckets with pals after a post-exams <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2021">Just Dance</a> party. The Wii was all about giving <em>everyone</em> the chance to play, and the Switch felt like it did it all over again.</p>
<p>That OG model, with its drifting Joy-Con and mysterious scratch on the back, got cashed in shortly after I started here at Nintendo Life and thought it only right to pick up a shiny new OLED to mark the occasion. I've kept this replacement in tip-top condition since, naturally, and will continue to do so long after my Switch 2 arrives.</p>
<p>It's only the threat of recency bias that keeps this wonderful hybrid from the top of my all-time favourite console list (where the DS currently sits), but I can see it sitting in pole position a few years down the line. So long, partner. You've been fantastic.</p>
<h2>An on, off, then fully-back-on-for-the-long-haul relationship (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f73b9ff24354c"><a title="OG Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f73b9ff24354c/og-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ah, my old mucker, which I haven't cleaned the dust off here for maximum effect. An ancient relic, this piece of early human history is actually my first Nintendo Switch (flanked by its siblings) and it still works. Probably. I'm not going to try it, just in case I release a curse and we have to get Brendan Fraser in (he's expensive since the Oscar).</p>
<p>Back in 2017, my mate got himself a Nintendo Switch and, for one of the first times ever, I decided to hold off a little on a new console launch, playing Breath of the Wild on my trusty Wii U, before finally realising I couldn't deal with the FOMO and capitulating. I then got very bored, very quickly. I'm not quite sure why — hard to remember anything that happened before COVID, innit — but I felt like the Switch wasn't going to be able to pull me away from shinier games on more powerful hardware. What a fool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years and Switch, besides having given me a route — through freelance reviews — into my current full-time job at this lovely place, has easily become my favourite console of all time. So many great games, so many cherished family memories (my sons have grown up on Mario Kart 8 and Zelda, which I think we can all agree is the best start in life), it's been the final proof needed for me, as a (pro) gamer, that graphics, raw horsepower, and all that fancy stuff isn't what makes this medium really tick.</p>
<p>So, having said all of those very nice things, you'd think I'd <em>at least</em> be nice enough to dust it, after everything it's done for me. Why am I such a pig? A question for another time, perhaps.</p>
<h2>Gone with the drift (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c5b492959b006"><a title="Nintendo Switch 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5b492959b006/nintendo-switch-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not sure where the biro across the Capture button on that blue Joy-Con came from — <em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've gone through three Switches in eight years. The first, a launch-day department store pickup, was donated to another family member when the better-battery version came out and I couldn't resist the tiniest of upgrades.</p>
<p>Then, when the OLED launched, I ended up swapping the better-battery one for my <em>original</em> launch-day Switch — the one I'd broken in with BOTW across four glorious weekend coach journeys throughout March '17 — which I've still got in the drawer. It's seen better days, and the rails don't hold the Joy-Con very well anymore (the same goes for my OLED), but it's still going.</p>
<p>I can't say what the future holds for them. It would be a shame for that OLED screen to go unused, but until my kids are older, these will probably stay in the drawer. One thing I <em>won't</em> be sad to see the back of is my drifting Joy-Con. I love the multicoloured lineup, but only two of the six pictured above function properly. Hmph.</p>
<p>But let's not let dodgy Joy-Con colour the memory of a little console that's become a part of the family. As with all family members, there's some crunchy with the smooth, but you wouldn't be without them. Goodnight, sweet Switch.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And there we are. We salute these Switches as we commit their tablets to the cupboard.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you be hanging up your S1 Joy-Con completely in a few days? Are you getting a little emotional about bidding this console farewell and getting involved with the new, shiny model? We'd love to hear your journeys with your personal Switches below.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Have Until 2030 to Build a Cyberpunk 2-Ready PC, Polish Analysts Predicts a Late 2030 Release for CDPR’s Estimated $419M Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-cd-projekt-red-2030-polish-firm-predicts/</link>
            <guid>1393786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that the next game we'll see from <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> is <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, one of the most anticipated games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/">not at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and a game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">that we probably won't see until 2027</a>. After that, however, is a game that more recent CDPR fans are arguably looking forward to more: Project Orion. Otherwise known as the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and for now, also known as <strong>Cyberpunk 2</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/">With the way RAM prices are going</a>, if your PC build is already behind on current releases, then you'll want to upgrade as soon as you can to ensure you're ready for The Witcher 4. With more than a year to prepare, that should be enough time to accumulate the parts you need and find a way to pay for them without having to mortgage your house. In the case of Cyberpunk 2? You'll have until 2030, according to Polish analyst firm Noble Securities.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109480/cyberpunk-2-has-a-dollars400-million-budget-and-will-release-in-2030-polish-analyst-firm-predicts/index.html">TweakTown</a>, that's when the firm believes the game will release, with the firm specifically predicting a late 2030 release window. The firm also adds that the game will cost CD Projekt RED a whopping $419 million to make, and that it'll include a multiplayer mode. We've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/">previous reports that Cyberpunk 2 includes a multiplayer mode</a>, though to see it again here adds even more flame to that fire.</p>



<p>"<em>The desire to integrate multiplayer into production prompted us to extend our production time beyond the progress of work on the benchmark W4</em>," said <strong>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</strong> in an investor's note. "<em>As a result, the budget has increased to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP277)."</em></p>



<p>For the sequel to arrive a decade later (and to have the release of The Witcher IV happen in between) would be quite the Cinderella story for CD Projekt RED. Not that the studio was down in the doldrums before Cyberpunk 2077 came out, but for Cyberpunk 2077 to have the release it did, and be fixed over the course of the next three years and have a complete redemption arc. Followed by what is hopefully a well-received release of The Witcher VI, and then the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel would be a hell of a way to close out the decade since Cyberpunk 2077's launch.</p>



<p>Who knows if that's how the story will go, of course. There are also plenty of questions remaining around how multiplayer will be implemented and what exactly that will look like for a game that players would reasonably expect to be focused on a single-player campaign. We'll have to wait and see, but for now, a 2030 release is not at all a bad prediction, considering what we know about where CD Projekt RED's focus is currently being placed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">the fact that work on the sequel is ramping up</a>. </p>
