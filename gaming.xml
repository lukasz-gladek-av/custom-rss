            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Alongside a single player career mode reveal, Straight4 Studios has confirmed that Project Motor Racing will launch on 24th November across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO (and controversially outspoken figurehead) Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>
<p>The career mode aims to provide a realistic take on motorsports careers, featuring over 70 vehicles from 10 different racing classes, going from 1970s sports cars through to modern GT3s and LMDh hypercars, and it will have 27 scanned real world tracks.</p>
<p>The career mode, as detailed in the trailer, looks fascinating. Instead of something akin to Gran Turismo where you take winnings, earn trophy cars and build a garage, the career gives you a starting point of your choice, and then challenges you to succeed and progress through financial earnings and smart moves. It’s not all about winning, but it is about your winnings.</p>

<p>You’ll have one of three financial backstories, set a location for your team – which affects entry fees and competitions available – and then choose financial backing through sponsors. There’s no car unlocks or levelling up needed for the top tier of racing, outside of simply needing to be able to afford them. Of course, higher and more generous sponsorship models (which could cover travel fees separately from base pay and performance bonuses) will come with higher demands, and if you can’t meet them, you could be out on your ear pretty quickly. Crashes and damage will also have an impact, as that cost comes out of your pocket.</p>
<p>It’s another interesting take on the concept, similar to how Project CARS let you start at any racing category, and will be fascinating to see how the financing is tuned and balanced in the game.</p>
<p>Of course PMR will also have a full suite of online multiplayer racing, focusing on more sim-minded gamers with features like full race weekends to test yourself again.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on for sim-racing fans and those looking for a fresh alternative to the more established examples of the genre.</p>

<p>Ready for an intermission?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's latest update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is now live, and the main change it's brought comes via the following patch note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Adjusted courses selected in “Random” when selecting next course in a wireless “VS Race.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so what does this mean? Well, prior to the update, selecting a standard race when competing online would give you the option to choose either an intermission race from a set selection of three courses, or choose something at random. The random option would often ditch the intermission setup in favour of a standard 3-lap race around one of the game's excellent themed courses.</p>
<p>So if you happen to see the vast majority of players choosing 'random' when selecting a course, this is why.</p>
<p>The update has changed this, and according to many fans, it's proven to be a bit of a slap in the face. Basically, Nintendo is now doubling down on the intermission races, meaning you begin the race on a rolling start and drive across the roads toward the selected track. We can't say for definite, but it seems like the possibility of playing standard 3-lap races is no more.</p>
<p>So yeah, fans aren't particularly happy with the update, as demonstrated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TWD98">TWD98</a>'s YouTube video above. Folks are also voicing their concerns over on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/mario-kart-world-st-drift-of-the-wild.13952/page-50">Famiboards</a>, with user CoralSensei4 stating "I was genuinely having fun playing this game and perfecting the three lap tracks for online and this just ruined all of that practice".</p>
<p>Our very own community user <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mario-kart-world-has-been-updated-to-version-1-1-2-here-are-the-full-patch-notes#comment8710259">Ade117</a> echoed this sentiment in our recent update article and said "What a downer of an update. I prefer to play 3 laps around a track, but Nintendo wants that to be as difficult as possible to do online".</p>
<p>Famiboards member hushh went one step further and said "Well that was basically a waste of money I guess. Won't touch this game until this tone deaf and idiotic decision is fixed".</p>
<p>We've no doubt Nintendo will continue to apply updates to Mario Kart World in the coming days, weeks, months, and even years. Here's hoping it takes feedback on board and makes standard 3-lap races an option for online play again.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2.1228758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, TEAMGROUP announced the launch of its new <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/product-detail/card/TEAMGROUP/apex-sd-7-1-microsd-express/apex-sd-7-1-microsd-express-TAPMSDE1TIV30A102/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APEX SD7.1 MicroSD Express Card</a>, which promises 'next-generation high-speed storage for handheld gaming'. Its primary usage case is, of course, with the Nintendo Switch 2 console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>The APEX SD7.1 features a PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and NVMe protocol and has an A1 rating for application performance, delivering significantly faster data transfer speeds. Thanks to the PCIe lane, the APEX SD7.1 offers read speeds far beyond those of traditional microSD cards of up to 800MB/s, which is 8x and 2.6x faster than the TEAMGROUP ELITE MicroSDXC A1 V30 (max 100MB/s) and T-CREATE EXPERT SDXC V90 (max 300MB/s), respectively.</p>
<p>It offers optimal performance on devices with a MicroSD Express slot, such as the aforementioned Nintendo Switch 2, but it remains fully backward compatible with handheld consoles and mobile devices that support standard MicroSD cards, such as the original Switch or Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>TEAMGROUP produced the card in capacities of 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1TB, with the highest capacity model able to store up to 18 games (assuming the average size is 26.8GB, like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition). It also supports Video Speed Class V30 and 4K UHD video recording, making it ideal for capturing smooth, high-resolution footage.</p>
<p>The APEX SD7.1 has multiple protection features to ensure durability and quality. It is resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments. The product includes a limited lifetime warranty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pricing details are not available yet. We have contacted TEAMGROUP to get them and will update this story if we receive them.</p>

			<p>The pirate-themed multiplayer survival adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crosswind</a> has opened up its Alpha Test <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, and anyone can now request access for a chance to join and check out this interesting title. This Alpha Test phase will run for at least four weeks, and there is no NDA, so those who are selected will be able to share their impressions, images, and videos captured while playing.</p>
<p>The following content is available in this build of Crosswind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Three unique biomes, each with its own resources, enemies, and environment twists<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three bosses, each offered in several difficulty tiers<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three playable ships plus one NPC merchant vessel<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground combat, ship-to-ship battles, and the very first pass at boarding actions<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roughly 30+ hours of content if you take the time to explore<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In a recent Steam blog post, the Crosswind Crew also clarified that this is a survival adventure game first and foremost, and that's the focus of this playtest, while an MMO-like layer is planned to be added later.</p>
<p><em>The game's structure is as follows: 'A player-controlled world plus various shared zones'. Each player has their own world in which the main story unfolds. This is a large archipelago comprising a dozen islands, a variety of biomes, resources, enemies and secrets. Most of it is procedurally generated, but some of the key points of interest are hand-crafted. This means that your world won't be the same as your friend's. You have full control over who can visit your world. You can keep it private. Alternatively, you can invite your friends to explore, craft and build with you, or even fight alongside you.</em></p>
<p><em>The MMO part of Crosswind consists of shared zones for various PvE and PvP activities. As you progress through the main story, you will unlock the ability to travel to other locations. These are shared among players. For example, in the upcoming playtest, we will have an early prototype of Tortuga. For now, it's just a place to trade goods and meet other players, but in the future, we'll transform it into a bustling social hub where you can discover new activities, make new friends, and even challenge someone to a duel! Other zones and activities, such as a naval PvP zone, will be added later in the development process, thus expanding the MMO part of Crosswind. We see PvP as an additional way to enjoy the game. It will be optional and take time to implement properly.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Sorry, not sure what happened there.

Also it's bloody depressing and I need to keep the mood up. Nothing else for it. Time to bring back a perennial audience favourite. Here's a tray-tray.</p>

<p>Developer Cyber Temple were kind enough to send me a preview build. Pre-warning: I only played an hour, because I didn't enjoy it very much. So, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3132870/DarkSwitch/">Steam sell</a> in case you want to ignore my opinions and just pop it on the wishlist for the inevitable demo - something I always heartily recommend.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Gather resources, research technologies, and send pioneers to explore the ruins of those who came before: discover their secrets and doom.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Set in a world of folk horror and creeping dread, DarkSwitch blends vertical city-building, tower defense, and exploration into a unique strategic experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Navigate a stunning, dangerous, dark fantasy world enriched by cinematic cutscenes and an atmospheric soundtrack from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Opinion the first, they only get worse: Akira Yamaoka is phoning it in. The music is pleasant and richly layered but nothing to write home about, unless perhaps you haven't spoken to your family in yonks and need a very tenuous coversation starter. Ah well! You play as a colony of elves and their architecture is suitably Rivendallian. Being elves they think they know it all and don't bother giving you much onboarding. This where the issues start. A style over substance UI. Exclamation points appear over buildings with no indication of what they mean. There's a counter down the right hand side of the screen, no tooltips or other explanations, ditto the 'Fear' counter in the top right.</p>
<p>The tutorial, such as it is, tells you <em>what</em> to do, but not how to do it. Not too tricky to work out, usually. But crucially, you're not told <em>why</em> you're doing it either. My people are hungry so I need to collect mushrooms, I can work that out. But what am I placing two 'flame guards' down? A tooltip tells me they have something to do with the fog that creeps in at night, and my citizens, but I'm given no further explanation and no indication of where to place to them. And the more crucial thing here is, since the game seems to be working backwards in terms of goals and motivations, there's little of Frostpunk's demanding energy or intrigue. I eventually peace out after digging in every menu for a tutorial-demanded building extension I just can't find.</p>
<p>Also, look. I've previously bemoaned the state of latent paranoia that the proliferation of AI art encourages, turning us all into little art purity witchhunters whenever something <em>might</em> be machine generated. All I'm saying is, if I perhaps wanted to avoid such speculation, I would not have gone for this particular look with the character portraits:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Apologies to Eldric Flambet. And that said, I really like how this wooden walkway automatically connects between buildings, and also how you can build structures on the trunk of the tree itself, Ewok style:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Cyber Temple</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I do still think the concept is really compelling. The writing is terse and veers simple but does its job. Some culty flamemen called Luminarchs show up in an airship after a bit and start interrogating and stealing my townsfolk. I'd like to know where that goes. And it's a pre-demo press preview build, right? I'm sure the developer sent it out because they know it isn't quite where they need it to be and wanted to see how the press reacted, so here's my reaction: sort out the first hour. Make me obsessed with your world rather than just a bit irritated at what parts you've seemingly randomly chosen to obscure from me, and give me an interesting goal straight away rather than just telling me to build things with no real sense of what I'm working towards. Otherwise: Nice elvish buildings. Nice concept. And, yes, very nice tree (hey!)</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkswitch-is-frostpunk-in-a-big-tree-with-music-from-silent-hill-composer-akira-yamaoka]]></content:encoded>

<p>The twist here is that you'll be trying to keep your midnight proclivities a secret from the townfolk, brushing the proverbial Chocolate Hobnob crumbs of forbidden arcane arts out of your beard and burning the packet before everyone else wakes up. There's a sort of social stealth system, too, that sees you chocolate hobnobbing at high society parties, presumably trying to not open every conversation with "Hi I'm Terry and all my mates are animated cadavers". There's also an excellent fully illustrated spellbook.</p>
<p>CRPGs come in a few flavours usually. You've got your swordies and wordies and the occasional nicely balanced swordy-wordy. NecTales has hex-based combat where you cast spells, backed up by your gang of flaky shamblers and clattering calcium lads, but otherwise looks to be hanging about on the wordy side of the scale. "400,000 words of hand-written narrative and lore," to be precise, alongside hand-drawn portraits for 180+ NPCs. "We have not used any generative AI in the game", say developers Psychic Software. Good by me. If I wanted to engage with a pallid, grotesque simulacrum of something real, I'd raise another zombie.</p>
<p>The game is set near alternate history Venice on the cusp of the Enlightenment - a setting apparently rife for exacerbated tensions between science and superstition. This history is not so alternative, however, as to prevent Twickenhamese satirist Alexander Pope popping up in the corner, presumably to bang on about Homer to anyone in earshot.</p>
<p>The Necromancer's Tale is out next month, July 17th. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1315320/The_Necromancers_Tale/">demo on Steam</a> available now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: this article contains major spoilers for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima returns us to a world of porters, BTs, BBs, Voidouts, and more with the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. As you’d imagine, it’s a story filled with complex terminologies, philosophical concepts, metaphysics, and more, but we’re here to help you make sense of it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, whether you finished the sequel and need help understanding the full picture of the ending, or just looking to see how Hideo Kojima’s newest adventure unfolds, here’s our full Ending Explained for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Setting the scene</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 picks up 11 months after the events of the first Death Stranding. Following the successful connection of the former United States to the Chiral Network (this world’s magical internet that is helping the world rebuild following the apocalyptic titular Death Stranding), defeating the terrorist leader Higgs, and preventing his sister Amelie from destroying the world, Sam Porter Bridges attempts to settle into a quiet life with his daughter, Lou. But that idea is quickly brought to a halt by the reappearance of former accomplice Fragile and her new company, Drawbridge, when she asks Sam to head south and get Mexico back on the grid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon connecting Mexico to the Chiral Network, it’s discovered that linking together a country appears to open a Plate Gate (a giant teleportation portal) to other continents. This is vital because after the events of the Death Stranding, civilization is still largely separated from each other, and Plate Gates would go a long way towards making Earth one interconnected society again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as Sam completes his Mexican mission, tragedy strikes when a mysterious armed group in red invades Sam’s home and kills Lou and injures Fragile, sending Sam into a depressive spiral over the loss of his child. Lost, he agrees to join Drawbridge and the crew of its ship, the DHV Magellan, on a mission to connect Australia, the destination of the Mexican Plate Gate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Who are the Armed Red Attackers?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-50-00-still020-1741556559513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You got red on you. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Knowing who attacked Lou and Fragile is the first step to understanding the ending of Death Stranding 2. The group in Red are mechanical soldiers 3D printed by a reborn Higgs, who, after the events of the first game, killed himself on his Beach only to come back as a glam rock mercenary robot hellbent on getting revenge on Sam and Fragile. This is why he attacks her and Lou.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Higgs didn’t just come back to life by himself. His soul was revived thanks to an entity known as APAS, a private corporation that manages the automated delivery robots transporting packages around the UCA. Their goal is to connect Mexico and later Australia to the Chiral Network to open even more Plate Gates and eventually link up the whole world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But behind the scenes, APAS is actually run by a sentient entity known as APAS 4000, which is the fusion of the APAS AI system that manages deliveries and 4000 human souls from people who were killed in a massive Voidout. Their ultimate goal is to elevate all humans into souls, preventing humanity from evolving and instead keeping them trapped in the world of the dead, stopping them from triggering another Voidout ever again. A benevolent, but ultimately misguided attempt to try and contain humanity from once again exploring the world and making connections with one another. It would keep Earth’s population safe, but at the cost of what makes them human, changing people further into digital entities in the shape of their saviors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How Sam Defeats APAS 4000</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-05-53-20-still054-1741556849891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Who is this charismatic...doll? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game of cat-and-mouse, APAS 4000 believes it is using Sam to further its goal of one day containing humanity from ever leaving their shelters ever again. But behind the scenes, Fragile’s Drawbridge knows about this plan and is working to stop APAS 4000. Fragile and Drawbridge’s benefactor, who is eventually revealed to be former President of the UCA, Die-Hardman, as well as the crew of the DHV Magellan, were in fact connecting various settlements in Australia using a new Q-Pid. This device would sever the connection between the world of the living and the dead, and by extension, cut off APAS 4000’s connection to the world due to it being an entity made up of dead souls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By fully connecting Australia with the new Q-Pid, APAS 4000 is split from the world of the living, and its plan to trap humanity fails.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wait, but what about Higgs?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-06-42-07-still038-1741556559514.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Higgs returns. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Higgs may have been brought back by APAS 4000 to try and push along its plans, Higgs is by no means a lackey. Instead, Higgs uses his newfound robot body to carry out a separate, more personally fuelled plan of revenge. It was he who attacked Fragile and Lou while Sam was busy reconnecting Mexico, and eventually it’s revealed that Higgs plans to finish what he started in the first Death Stranding game and bring about the end of the world via “The Last Stranding”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas in the first game, Higgs tried to use the Extinction Entity known as Amelie to trigger the earth-ending event, this time he tries to use Tomorrow, a young woman Sam recovers from the world of the dead, who has mysterious powers that allow her to use tar to speed up decay. By using Tomorrow as an Extinction Entity, Higgs’ plan is to once and for all end human life, killing Sam and Fragile in the process. While Sam manages to defeat Higgs and finally end his apocalyptic fantasy via a combo of samurai sword duelling, electric guitar battle, and good ol’ fashioned fistfight, Higgs does succeed in completing one of his goals…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fragile Dies</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-17-25-still015-1741556559512.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A hero's death. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For much of Death Stranding 2, we’re made to think thatFragile survived the attack by Higgs, but Lou died. In reality, Fragile used her trans-dimensional teleportation powers to send Lou to the world of the dead, while Fragile was the one killed by Higgs. Because time dilation and the distinction between life and death are all kinds of messed up in the world of Death Stranding, the Fragile that Sam and the DHV Magellan crew have been travelling with the entire game is actually Fragile’s soul that she temporarily left behind to help Sam and the crew defeat Higgs, stop APAS 4000, and reconnect the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, her time in the world of the living is only temporary, and she dies for real at the end of the game. But what about Lou?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>BB-28/Lou/Tomorrow/Louise</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-11-14-22-still038-1750343168751.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Who is she? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, Lou was spared in the attack by Higgs in Mexico as Fragile used her powers to send Lou to another beach, effectively another dimension. Sent away by Fragile, Lou grew up in the world of the dead as manifested by the soldier Neil Vanna (more on him later). Years later, Sam Porter Bridges will end up fighting Neil in this world and inadvertently rescue Lou, who is none other than Tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, Tomorrow is in fact the same baby Lou that Fragile sent away at the start of the game. Lou, short for Louise, is also BB-28 that Sam traveled across the UCA with in Death Stranding, and more than that, is actually Sam’s biological daughter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Neil, Sam, and Lucy Love Triangle</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/06/death-stranding-blog-1749244480461.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vana. Neil Vana. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, now we explain the final puzzle that ties all of Death Stranding 2 together. So Louise survives Higgs’ initial attack in Mexico and grows up to become Tomorrow. But why did Higgs want Lou in the first place?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because decades ago, Sam, who I should remind you is a Repatriate — someone who can resurrect themselves thanks to the effects of the Death Stranding — was in a relationship with a therapist named Lucy. Around this time, Lucy was seeing another patient, a man named Neil Vana, who was a smuggler working for Bridges to deliver illegally acquired brain-dead pregnant women whose stillborn babies would become the very first Bridge Babies. Wracked with guilt, Neil sought the help of Lucy, who, it turns out, saved Neil when they were both children from the same village under attack by BTs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reunited after all those years, Neil rekindles a relationship with Lucy that becomes romantic even though Lucy was in a relationship with Sam at the time. Despite Neil and Lucy’s close relationship, Lucy chose to stay with Sam, and together they conceived a child.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a baby born from a Repatriate like Sam held high value for Bridges, who were still conducting their original experiments with BBs. Once they discovered Lucy’s pregnancy, Bridges sought to take the child from her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To protect the unborn baby Louise, Lucy convinced Neil to pretend to be the father of the child, making the baby less valuable to Bridges. Together with the baby, they would escape the city and Bridges, but would sadly never make it that far as both Neil and Lucy are killed, but not before Louise is removed from Lucy’s dying body, thus saving the baby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Louise becomes BB-28, but is thankfully hidden away by Sam’s adoptive mother and President of the United States, Bridget Strand, keeping her hidden long enough to be reunited with Sam decades later during the events of the original Death Stranding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Neil, his final act of revenge against Bridges is for his body to necrotize, therefore causing a Voidout and destroying the city and everyone in it. Meanwhile, Neil’s soul wanders the earth, unable to find peace. Similar to  Mads Mikkelsen’s Cliff in the first game, Neil’s mercenary soul haunts Sam until the two men face off in a destined duel that finally gives Neil peace and Sam closure with Lucy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Post-credits scene, and will we get a Death Stranding 3?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/vs-youtube-deathstranding2onthebeachendingandfinalbossfight4k-6911-1750884722656.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will there be a Death Stranding 3? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that isn’t quite the end of the revelations. Yes, Death Stranding 2 does have a post-credit scene, and it features a seemingly even more grown-up Tomorrow/Louise dressed up in full porter gear, as well as inheriting Fragile’s creepy second set of hands and her smoking habit. She’s faced with a Plate Gate, perhaps signalling that she’ll follow in her father’s steps and attempt to connect another new continent to the Chiral Network. Could Death Stranding 3 have us going to Europe, Asia, or Africa, for example? And could we be playing as Tomorrow in the sequel? We certainly wouldn’t say no to playing around with her unique tar-infused martial arts skillset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s the full ending of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach explained.

<p>But it will support 12 players online</p>

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83b515fc5533b/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is bringing out a new "fast-paced" multiplayer game this August called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, where players will be able to "shoot hoops" with the Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 dual-mouse controls.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">release date announcement</a> earlier this week, the eShop listing for this upcoming title has now revealed this "3-on-3" sports title will actually support double this amount online, bumping the fun up to 12 players. Details about this have not been provided just yet.</p>
<p>While this is exciting news, local multiplayer will apparently be restricted to just one player. So even if you have an extra set of Joy-Con 2 or someone nearby who is ready for a local wireless session across two units, it seems you'll still need to team up online with an active Switch Online subscription. If we hear any changes or updates about this, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Nintendo's page listing for Drag x Drive also reconfirms TV mode and Tabletop mode will be supported. You can find out more about Drag x Drive in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Update on the Switch 2 today</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54b79c38cdbff/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been rolling out game updates every week since the Switch 2 arrived earlier this month, and we've now got a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>This follows a small patch last week and bumps the game up to Version 1.1.2. It comes with some general adjustments and also resolves some more issues you may or may not have encountered during the game's races.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Ver. 1.1.2 (Released June 25, 2025)<br></h3>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted courses selected in “Random” when selecting next course in a wireless “VS Race.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made readjustments to fix an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Online Play” and “Knockout Tour.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes can’t recover quickly after falling off the course in "Dino Dino Jungle".</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you continually hit the wall near the finish line of “Boo Cinema” when transformed into Bullet Bill.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Dataminer 'OatmealDome' has shared <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1938057415347343870">what else is going on behind the scenes</a> in this latest Mario Kart World update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Random option can now also pick from the options you are given (i.e. courses with an intermission) in version 1.1.2. It *can* still choose to teleport everyone to a random course with 3 laps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> yesterday. Nintendo has also updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> this week.</p>

<p>Shoot some hoops this August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo surprised us with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">update about the release date</a> of the 3-on-3 sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, confirming it would be arriving on the Switch 2 this August.</p>
<p>Adding to this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/drag-x-drive-switch-2-eshop-price-revealed">was a price reveal</a> and now in another update, we've got what appears to be the game's estimated file size. According to Nintendo's official store listing it will require a download of 1.7GB.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's nowhere near the size of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> game and is instead closer to the file size of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> eShop title.</p>
<p>Once again, pre-orders are live for $19.99 (or your regional equivalent) and you can pre-load the title, so you'll be able to play it as soon as it launches.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 comes loaded with a total of 256GB storage, which is a huge step up on the Switch's internal space, but if you are running out of space, you can always <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">expand your storage with a microSD Express card</a>.</p>

Oddly enough, you're not actually catching these fish. These just mark the area where you'll be reeling in Pals and other in-game items.</p><p dir="ltr">You have the potential to catch both new and existing Pals in the game. To get started, you'll need a fishing rod and some bait. Then, head to the water and cast your line near a school of fish. A minigame will occur once a "fish" takes the bait. This game is similar to fishing in Stardew Valley, where you have a fishing meter and need to keep a green bar near the fish to successfully reel them in.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also catch even more Pals by building and placing fishing ponds inside your base. We'll cover details on the fishing ponds below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808"></a><figcaption>Fishing in Palworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_fishing_rods">How to craft fishing rods</h2><p dir="ltr">There are various fishing rods that you can craft at various levels, and here we'll break down the requirements for each.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Beginner_Fishing_Set">Beginner Fishing Set</h3><p dir="ltr">Available at technology level 15, the beginner fishing set costs 2 points to unlock.

There are several bait types you can use: Simple Bait, High Quality Bait, Deluxe Bait, and Alluring Bait.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Simple_bait">Simple bait</h3><p dir="ltr">Simple Bait is unlocked when you purchase the beginner fishing set. This is the most basic bait type for fishing for Pals. This is a decent starting point for fishing, but it won't be very effective in luring Pals to bite.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Berries</li><li dir="ltr">2 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="High_Quality_Bait">High Quality Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">High Quality Bait is available at technology level 22, and it can be unlocked for 1 point. This bait lures in Pals, and it's improved quality to make catching them more readily.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Tomatoes</li><li dir="ltr">3 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deluxe_Bait">Deluxe Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">The Deluxe bait is available at technology level 38, and it can be unlocked for 2 points. This bait lures in Pals and also enlarges the size of the bar in the fishing minigame.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">4 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">4 Onion</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrot</li><li dir="ltr">4 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Alluring_Bait">Alluring Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">The Alluring bait is available at technology level 52, and it can be unlocked for 2 points. This bait has several benefits, as it lures in Pals, improves the minigame, and increases the number of items obtained from earning. This includes Pals and salvage items.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">1 Cavern Mushroom</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrots</li><li dir="ltr">5 Flour</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you've unlocked a bait type, it can then be crafted at the High Quality Workbench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810"></a><figcaption>Fishing pond at base</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_fishing_ponds">How to use fishing ponds</h2><p dir="ltr">You can build fishing ponds at your base so your Pals can fish, too. You'll need to craft some bait to place here and assign a Pal to fish for you. Not every Pal can fish, but you should have quite a few options by the time you're high enough level to unlock them. You'll need to assign someone who can use their hands, which means you'll need a handiwork Pal like Anubis, Lyleen, or Katress.</p><p dir="ltr">These ponds have the potential to catch new and existing aquatic Pals, as well as in-game items such as gold and gems. These items can be collected from the cooler sitting next to your fishing Pal.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fishing_pond">Fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">The first Fishing Pond is found at technology level 31, and it can be unlocked for 3 points.</p><p dir="ltr">To build, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">40 Wood</li><li dir="ltr">5 Cement</li><li dir="ltr">10 Pal Fluids</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Large_fishing_pond">Large fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">This larger pond makes it possible to catch even larger Pals than the standard pond.

Just place an aquatic Pal in your party and make sure you've crafted a saddle for them. Use your fishing pole to reel in various items, such as Pal Souls, Gold, and gems.</p><p dir="ltr">Salvage spots in the sea are marked by floating bits of wood and barrels. You'll obviously need a fishing pole equipped, but bait isn't necessary. You simply need to interact with the floating junk to start a minigame. This is different from the fishing minigame, and instead, you'll see a ring that requires you to stop a spinning marker inside a highlighted green area.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld's <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1937709560053285318" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for the update state you can also salvage a new metal from the sea to use in upgrading your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I haven't caught any metal yet. It's likely you'll need the update's new Powerful Fishing Magnet.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Powerful_Fishing_Magnet">Powerful Fishing Magnet</h3><p dir="ltr">This new item is described as a high-powered magnet for advanced salvage operations. It's likely a magnet that will pull the new metal type and other high-end items from the sea.</p><p dir="ltr">The Powerful Fishing Magnet is available at technology level 61, and it costs 3 points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following material:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 Hexolite</li></ul><p>For more Palworld guides, make sure to check out how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-change-a-pals-gender-and-passive-skills-in-palworld/1100-6532740/" data-ref-id="1100-6532740">change a Pal's gender and passive skills</a>, how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-transfer-pals-to-different-worlds-in-palworld/1100-6530261/">move Pals to different worlds</a>, and how to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-upgrade-palworld-schematics-to-better-rarities/1100-6530263/"> upgrade your schematics</a>.</p>

Capcom has said the livestream will last about 40 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the start times for different time zones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">11 PM BST</li><li dir="ltr">8 AM (June 27)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect</h2><p dir="ltr">While there is always a small chance for surprises, Capcom has announced the four games that will be featured in the livestream. Those games are Monster Hunter Wilds, Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Games Fest 2025</a>, and now Capcom is planning to show off more of it during the stream. Some outlets, including GameSpot, got to see an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/">extended demo of Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which could be shown here to the public. It's also possible that Capcom has even more to show, since Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 26, 2026</p><p dir="ltr">Pragmata got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest along with a 2026 release window. GameSpot played a hands-on demo of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-juggling-gunplay-and-puzzles-gets-surprisingly-tense/1100-6532386/">puzzle-shooter</a> at Summer Games Fest, and it seems possible Capcom could show off more gameplay here. Considering Pragmata got its 2026 release window just a few weeks ago, it seems unlikely that a more specific date will be announced during the Capcom Spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds, which currently has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/">overwhelmingly negative reviews</a> on Steam due to ongoing performance issues, will likely see announcements of new content updates, including potential upcoming events or new monsters. While there will most likely be a Monster Hunter Wilds expansion announced at some point in the future, it is probably too soon for that to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom recently announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-adds-sagat-c-viper-and-two-more-characters/1100-6532220/" data-ref-id="1100-6532220">DLC fighters coming in Year 3</a> of Street Fighter 6--Sagat, C. Viper, Ingrid, and Alex--but Sagat, the first character to be released, doesn't have a release date just yet. There will likely also be other updates, like new cosmetics and perhaps a showcase of the new fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">With the showcase running for about 40 minutes, it seems like there won't be much time for additional announcements. However, Capcom has unveiled a classic game collection or two at past showcases, so never say never.</p>

Improved textures and lighting, as well as an audio experience that’s been completely remastered from the ground up, are just the start of what was outlined for players on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S. Nintendo Switch, however, was left out of the lineup entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: Retouched - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Techland to ask about a potential Dying Light: Retouched update for Nintendo Switch and if it’s something players can look forward to in the future. A representative for the studio tells us it’s not in the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Dying Light: Retouched Update is not coming to Nintendo Switch,” Techland explained in an email exchange.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dying Light first arrived for Nintendo’s original hybrid gaming platform <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-nintendo-switch-platinum-edition"><u>in 2021 as an all-encompassing Platinum Edition bundle</u></a>.

For now, Dying Light is only playable on Nintendo’s new hardware via backward compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When it comes to a Switch 2 port of the original Dying Light: We have no plans at this moment,” Techland tells us. “We're currently fully focused on delivering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast"><u>Dying Light: The Beast</u></a> on August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you plug the world’s best-reviewed webcams into the Nintendo Switch 2 today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">they won’t work, while many comparatively ancient webcams do</a>. Why? That’s been a mystery for the nearly three weeks since the handheld launched. Now, two companies say they’ve figured it out and are pledging to update the firmware on their cameras.</p><p>Here’s a possibly oversimplified answer: today’s more powerful webcams advertise many different modes that they support to any device you connect via USB — but <em>that’s a problem</em> because the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be choosing modes it can’t properly play.</p><p>In the case of Elgato, which will update its non-working Facecam MK.2 and Facecam Neo, the solve was adding an additional low-resolution 480p mode, <a href="https://x.com/JFest/status/1937966174429712886">with Elgato general manager Julian Fest speculating</a> that the Switch can only reliably support “very low resolution” cameras in order to put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZZ1akN8V8">multiple facecams on screen</a>.</p><p>But low resolution by itself isn’t the answer — as you’d probably expect, given that Nintendo’s own official Switch 2 camera is a 1080p camera that genuinely broadcasts a 1080p mode (we checked), and given it’s far from the only 1080p or higher camera that works with Nintendo’s new Switch.</p><p>Accessory company Ugreen tells <em>The Verge</em> that the technical details of making a camera work with the console are far more nuanced than resolution, or frame rate, or whether you have the enhanced bandwidth of USB 3 or the far slower USB 2.</p><p>Nor is it enough for the camera to support a single compatible UVC (USB Video Class) mode. Instead, Ugreen spokesperson Gabrielle Wang explains by email, the camera needs to <em>avoid</em> advertising modes or protocols that the Switch might not recognize, or that it might attempt to use but fail, after you plug it into the console.</p><p>Ugreen says three different conditions <em>all simultaneously </em>need to be met for a camera to work with the Switch 2:</p><div><ul><li><span>“The camera must not use the HID protocol.”</span></li><li><span>“The camera must be configured for Isochronous transfer mode.” (<a href="https://www.regami.solutions/post/isochronous-isoc-vs-bulk-choosing-right-transfer-mode-usb-cameras">As opposed to Bulk</a>, which can be more resource intensive.)</span></li><li><span>“The USB endpoint descriptors must not include unsupported low frame rate settings (below 30 fps).” More on that one in a sec.</span></li></ul></div><p>Unfortunately, you’re not likely to find any of those “specs” on a camera’s box or in its marketing materials, but but they are things you can check with a connected PC and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview">a tool like USBView</a> — and in so doing, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXg6qfvBkS5nhfzY6-ABoEp1RraYqh6s2VvPpLfByi4/edit?tab=t.8dlf1ievxdr9">we can see</a> the camera incompatibility situation is more nuanced than a single factor.</p><p>Elgato’s Facecam MK.2, for instance, already advertises isochronous modes to connected devices as far as I can tell, and it doesn’t advertise an HID interface. In fact, it appears to already offer a 480p mode as well.</p><p>But Elgato’s camera may have broken Ugreen’s third theoretical rule — it tells connected devices like the Switch 2 that it’s capable of running as low as 5 fps at a variety of different resolutions, according to the USB Device Descriptors I’ve viewed. Ugreen says that the Switch 2 may prioritize lower settings, “but if the camera hardware cannot actually output at such low frame rates, it will cause a failure.”</p><p>It wouldn’t be surprising if Ugreen had an easier time figuring this out: though none of Elgato’s webcams worked with the Switch 2 at launch, Ugreen had the benefit of discovering that some of its models did, while others did not.</p><p>Ugreen says its CM826 / 55512, CM797 / 45644, and CM825 / 75330 cameras will have updates by the end of June, while the CM678 / 15728, CM778 / 35626, CM717 / 25442, CM825 / 55721, and CM831 / 65381 already work.</p><p>But I wonder if this should solely be the responsibility of camera companies — PCs, for example, don’t generally have this same trouble picking from a webcam’s list of supported video modes. Perhaps Nintendo will address the webcam compatibility situation, globally, with an update of its own.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t have a comment for our story.</p><div><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andru-marino">Andru Marino</a> contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When Epic first revealed and launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s popular new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">Blitz Royale mode</a> on June 17, it came with an expiration date of July 15. But it didn't take long for the company to deliver an extension.. Blitz Royale has consistently been Fortnite's most popular mode in the week since it launched, and on Wednesday, Epic updated the Fortnite API with <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1937960260406296938" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four additional weeks of Blitz Royale</a>. The new end date is apparently August 12.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1937963962600939740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakers believe</a> they already know the themes Epic will give to each of the additional weeks: Jujutsu Kaisen, Mortal Kombat, and Dragon Ball. Blitz Royale is currently having Avatar Week, which will be followed by Boss Week next Tuesday, and then TMNT Week after that. Each of these weeks will feature weapons and items related to the theme--for the current Avatar week, for example, the loot pool is full of the bending scrolls that were in standard Battle Royale during Chapter 5 Season 2, and TMNT week will bring back each of the turtles' melee weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. </p><p>Blitz Royale is a quicker and smaller version of Fortnite's battle royale, with 32 players on a tiny map, and rounds that last under five minutes. It's a faster and furiouser version of Fortnite, and it caught on immediately. If Blitz Royale continues pulling in tons of players, it's very likely that Epic will make it a permanent mode eventually. This initial launch period may be about seeing how Blitz Royale affects the overall Fortnite ecosystem. Since all seems to be going well on that front, we expect it won't stay away long if it actually does leave on August 12.</p><p>As it is, Blitz Royale will definitely need some overhauls. For one thing, the initial storm circle is the same in every round, always cutting off the northern part of the island. Secondly, Blitz Royale deserves its own fresh map, because the current Blitz map is just a smaller version of the Reload Venture island, and that in turn was just a smaller version of the Chapter 1 OG island. We've already wasted enough of our lives fighting over Pleasant Park and Retail Row, thank you very much.</p>

In those articles, it was revealed that Facebook permitted certain accounts to bypass company policies, dragged its feet in dealing with human trafficking networks on the platform, and ignored its own internal research into the harm Instagram was doing to teens’ mental health. Since the first <em>Social Network</em> created Oscar-worthy drama out of the Winklevoss twins suing Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing their idea—and the Facebook head honcho being a dick to co-founder and former friend Eduardo Saverin—this follow-up will surely have more than enough material to remind us how deleterious the company has been to the world at large.</p><p>It’s important to note that while the film is titled <em>The Social Network Part II</em>, sources told <em>Deadline</em> the movie will not be a direct sequel to the original film. There hasn’t even been any confirmation of Eisenberg returning to reprise his role as Zuckerberg, or that any of the original cast members will appear.
