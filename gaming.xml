<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a>'s long-awaited DLC, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure_-_wheatflour_wonderland">Wheatflour Wonderland</a>, is out on Switch today in North America for <strong>$14.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Europe and Australia will have to wait until next week, 23rd September (as per the game's Discord, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HelloKittyIsland/comments/1njzmza/update_delay/">via HelloKittyIsland subreddit</a>) , to get their hands on the expansion, which brings a newer Sanrio character to the game, Cogimyun, to the island.</p>
<p>Except it's not just a new character and some new mechanics that Wheatflour Wonderland delivers: you've got a whole new map, new potential residents, glitter effects, new recipes, new puzzles and minigames, and some new story.</p>
<p>Essentially, it brings more delights to the already lovely base game, which has already received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/hello-kitty-island-adventure-scores-first-major-content-update-heres-whats-included">a big free update in the Spring</a> that includes quality-of-life fixes, a new area, and new potential islanders.</p>

<p>Island Adventure made a splash when it launched on Switch in January this year, selling <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-surpass-half-a-million-in-30-days">around half a million copies in just a month</a>. It's a cute and cosy game about making friends with some of Sanrio's most-popular characters, including the titular Hello Kitty, My Melody, Kuromi, Hangyodon, Chococat, and Cinnamoroll.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet grabbed it on Switch and are thinking about taking the plunge, we rather liked it, so have a read of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hello-kitty-island-adventure">our review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-is-out-now-is-steam-deck-verified-and-has-a-new-shiny-launch-trailer.1301880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has been working up to the third mainline installment in the series for the last few years since the launch of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">after a late delay</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">release date being moved forward</a>, Dying Light: The Beast is officially out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>A new launch trailer premiered alongside the game going live on all platforms, showing even more gameplay off and giving players a recap on how they'll find returning protagonist Kyle Crane at the beginning of The Beast's story.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsqBCs7o5go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Techland has also confirmed that the game is Steam Deck verified, so players can take their parkouring adventure on the go with them if they want. Rendering and audio director at Techland, Tomasz Szałkowski, said that he was "<em>personally driven</em>" to ensure that the game would run on Steam Deck, overseeing the creation of a special performance mode "<em>that contains a mix of tweaked settings and special optimizations together with HDR and VRR running smoothly on an OLED display.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Dying Light is back, and I couldn't be more proud of my team and the game we created</em>," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland's chief executive officer in a press release. "<em>Their passion, dedication, and hard work have resulted in something truly great. This project taught us more than any before about the importance of staying true to the core elements of our IP. For players, it's an exciting return to the roots of the series, and for us, we're back on the right track!</em>"</p>



<p>Franchise director Tymon Smektała added, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast is our love letter to the series and to the incredible Dying Light community. Our players have stood with us through highs and lows, and our greatest ambition with this project was to deliver the game that our community truly deserves. To all the fans of Kyle Crane and Dying Light, the moment is here. It's time to unleash The Beast!</em>"</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and while its tried-and-true approach to combat and parkour mechanics delivers an undeniably fun time, the overall package of the game was lacking in anything more substantial.</p>



<p>You can check out my full review for more details, and what led me to feeling that, "<em>Overall, those two pillars only keep the game interesting for as long as you want to keep your brain turned off. A dash of well-executed survival elements around those pillars doesn't make up for the rest of the ways the game is lacking, making Dying Light: The Beast a missable title as we move into the final months of 2025 with plenty of major releases on the horizon.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/remakes-popular-report-survey-fallout-3-eso-oblivion-2000626866</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-era-of-video-game-remakes-is-just-getting-started-new-report-finds.1301874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I bet if you’re reading this post right now you’ve played <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-video-game-remakes-remasters-best-2024-ff7-rebirth-1851728879">a remake or a remaster</a> of an old video game at some point in the last 12 months. According to a new survey of 1,500 other players, you’re not alone. A whopping 90 percent of respondents said they’d also played a modern revival of a classic game at some point in the last year. And how could you not? More and more keep coming out all of the time.</p> <p>The new data point comes from strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM, which this week published its “<a href="https://marketing.wearemtm.com/remakevsinnovate">Remake vs Innovate: Is the past the future of gaming?</a>” report (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/90-of-gamers-have-played-a-remake-or-remaster-finds-new-report"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>). It interviewed 750 players in the U.S. and 750 in the UK and found the overwhelming majority not only played remakes and remasters, but also often hadn’t played the games they were based on. About 67 percent said it was their preferred way to discover older games, and 85 percent said they’d never played the originals before.</p> <p>Some other results from the survey:</p> <ul> <li>Only 26 percent of players thought remakes or remasters could be priced the same as other games or the original versions, with the rest expecting them to be cheaper.</li> <li>About 60 percent thought 5-8 years is the ideal amount of time between versions. Only 11 percent thought 10 years or more was preferable.</li> <li>Only 31 percent found remasters or remakes “very appealing.”</li> </ul> <p>Trying to layer logic onto the gamer psyche is often a fool’s errand, but the takeaway from this one report at least appears to be that most people are actually okay with updating old games as long as they are 1) not too old and 2) sold for less. Apparently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-remake-hbo-show-1851038633"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> remaster</a> that most of us mocked is actually exactly what some not insignificant cohort of players really want.</p>

 <h2>Why we’re about to get more remakes and remasters than ever</h2> <p>While MTM’s report suggests that many players aren’t outraged at the idea of getting spoon-fed old games like they’re new again, the sales success of things like <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>, and <em>Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater</em> speak for themselves. And it’s easy to see why companies would want to glom onto this opening in the market.</p> <p>Remakes and remasters can be outsourced (Virtuos handled both <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Snake Eater</em>), they help plug holes in ever elongating release schedules (<em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and <em>Fallout 5</em> are still nowhere in sight), and they offer newer studio teams a chance to familiarize themselves with a game’s design and development pipeline before jumping onto a new entry from scratch. Pulling the best-selling blockbusters of the past into the present is also one way to avoid the risks of taking a chance on a sequel or new IP.</p>

 <p>The results aren’t always cynical either. Nightdive’s 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/system-shock-remake-playstation-xbox-1851331384"><em>System Shock Remake</em></a> was a faithful restoration and update to an immersive sim classic that also made it playable for the first time on consoles. Few had a chance of rediscovering<em> Persona 3</em> on PS2 or PSP, but last <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">year’s remake</a> showed a whole new generation of players why some fans love it even more than <em>Persona 4</em> and <em>5</em>. Remakes and remasters have given <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918">no shortage of classic RPGs</a> that might otherwise feel borderline archaic by today’s standards a second chance thanks to quality-of-life features that let you turn off random encounters or speed up combat.</p> <p>There are already way too many new games to keep up with. Giving me more reasons to check out an old one feels increasingly like a good thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is like one of those “boots on the ground” first person shooter sequels, where the studio recognises that the last game maybe wasn’t quite what people wanted and tries to go back to what everyone loves the last time round. Where the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/02/06/dying-light-review/">Dying Light</a> put much of the focus on the zombies, how they were evolving, and keeping them terrifying, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/02/dying-light-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc/">Dying Light 2</a> shifted focus to warring human factions like every other piece of zombie media you can find these days. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> seems to be a significant course correction, ensuring that the zombies are front and centre, not just on your screen, but in the narrative as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsqBCs7o5go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This also comes with a return to playing as Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original game, as he’s being tortured and experimented on by the mysterious Baron. You quickly learn that Crane has been locked up here for 13 years before escaping out into the Swiss Alps, of all places. Specifically, Dying Light: The Beast is set in Caster Woods, which used to be a tourist hotspot before all the zombies came and ruined it. It’s still a beautiful location, but it’s one that’s filled with disused warehouses, an abandoned town, fields, and of course legions of the undead. Then, when the sun goes down and you can’t see a thing, the volatiles – extra evolved zombies that are exceptionally difficult to beat in combat – come out to play whilst you cower and weep in a bed that’s bathed in zombie-repelling UV light.</p>


<p>Night time is absolutely terrifying again, with volatiles roaming freely everywhere and the environment being literally pitch black without your torch. Which these super-zombies are smart enough to see and track. It’s incredibly intense at night, turning the action gameplay of daytime into a stealth sequence so intense you’ll stand still for minutes at a time in a bush trying to figure out where to go next. Of course, all the best loot is found inside dark areas, so you’ll need to brave the night to get your hands on it as they’re packed with beasties hiding from the sunlight during the day. It’s a clever dichotomy. You can do plenty of looting during the day, but those dark areas are there, just constantly tempting you until it’s been long enough since you ventured out in the dark that you can rationalise it as “surely it won’t be that bad.”</p>


<p>Crane’s main priority is getting revenge on the Baron. As is typical of people with names like that, he has an army of soldiers, plenty of resources, and he’s an absolute bastard. For some god forsaken reason he’s been developing increasingly more dangerous zombies. Thankfully, Kyle Crane has some zombie DNA inside him, lending him beastly abilities as he flies into a rage, zombie hulks out and starts beating up enemies with his fists, occasionally grabbing one and ripping them in two, or punching straight through their chest. This also allows him to use a pathogen in the blood of the Baron’s zombie experiments to improve his zombie hulking abilities – things like picking up large objects to throw, ground slam shockwaves, super speed, super jump, etc.</p>
<p>These experimental zombies are boss fights and the game is front-loaded with a few of them. Whilst a couple were pretty standard big tough bosses that summoned minions, another was a much more agile foe that can jump off of its minions at you as well as summon clouds of mist. They’re all good enough for a boss fights, but I worry that the big tough ones will get a bit repetitive if there’s many more of them.</p>
<p>While you’re waiting for opportunities to take out experimental zombies like a child eagerly anticipating yet another Fortnite skin to waste their parents’ money on, you’ll be doing standard Dying Light stuff. That’s looting stuff for resources, clearing new safe areas, looting stuff for more resources, activating power substations, and looting stuff for even more resources. You do a lot of looting from the environment in this game, and there’s a good reason for that; it’s because the crafting system is a bit frustrating. On normal difficulty, after about eleven to twelve hours I’ve managed to install only a few weapon mods, simply because I never have the resources after crafting invaluable consumable items like bandages, Molotov cocktails, grenades, and throwing knives. There’s just always one resource I don’t have enough of and it’s always a different resource from the last time.</p>

<p>You have to expect some looting in a game like this, but to return from a night of pilfering in which you successfully outran seventeen volatiles, only to realise that you need to go looting again is as frustrating as forgetting to buy Yorkshires for your Sunday roast and having to race back to the shops before they close – you’ve also run out of eggs in this scenario, so can’t make your own. At least survivor sense no longer has a cooldown on it, so you can highlight nearby loot all you like, but it would be nicer if things stayed highlighted for longer because spamming it constantly seems pointless. It doesn’t help that the weapon mods, or at least the ones I have so far, don’t feel particularly effective and only trigger on critical hits, which isn’t very often and almost makes them feel severely neutered compared to the first game. Hopefully this is just because they’re lower level mods still.</p>
<p>There are a few frustrations outside of the loot system. The ease and regularity with which zombies can grab you in combat is patently absurd, even more than it was in the original game, interrupting your attack and forcing you to smash buttons until you free yourself, redirect it, or waste a throwing knife on an instant kill from the grapple. It just seems to happen without any resistance even when I’m swinging with a big hammer. It also took me a little while to readjust to aiming, as sometimes you just miss when swinging at an enemy in front of you due to the path your arm takes and the zombie somehow threading the needle to avoid it with its casual zombie movements. Even after getting used to it again, it still happens sometimes. I really shouldn’t be missing a zombie that’s in front of me when I’m swinging a giant axe at it.</p>

<p>There are now cutscenes where you can actually see Kyle Crane, but he’s not looking good. Not in terms of all the scarring, which to be expected, but the facial animations don’t match his incredible emotive voice acting,&nbsp;making it look really strange as a seemingly slightly bored Kyle shouts about killing the Baron, some zombies or whatever. The facial animation on everyone is a bit weak, but it’s most noticeable on Kyle because he’s understandably rather angry all the time. Of course, outside of this the game is absolutely stunning in that dilapidated, post-apocalyptic way you’d expect, until the Sun goes down, at which point you can’t see anything because you’ve turned your torch off and are cowering in fear.</p>
<p>These flaws don’t have too much of an effect on the experience so far, though. It’s a return to the classic tone and style of Dying Light. This feels more like the truer sequel to Dying Light I was expecting, one that’s focused on the zombies and being terrifying instead of everything being about how humans are bad – we get enough of that in the real world these days. Dying Light: The Beast is&nbsp;tough and brutal whilst the suns up, and after sunset it’s just tension and terror. I’m not finished yet, but The Beast is mostly the game I wanted it to be.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned for our updated and scored review in the next few days. Dying Light: The Beast is out now for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and coming later this year for PS5 and Xbox One. It’s available as a standalone game release, as well as being included as part of the season pass for Dying Light 2.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/583377cf12e85/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I rarely expect big <strong>Pokémon</strong> news during Nintendo Directs. Maybe an NSO drop (pffft), perhaps some details on the already-announced game coming out. I certainly did not anticipate my dream of becoming a Ditto who can transform into a human being to come true during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">latest showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s obviously not what I’ve spent my many years growing up with Pokémon thinking about, but it is the spark that sets in motion my actual, long-desired Pokémon spin-off, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>: <em>a life sim.</em></p>
<p>I have to ask, how has it taken The Pokémon Company almost 30 years to come up with a Pokémon life sim? In a series all about bonding with creatures, and many entries featuring customisation elements, the ability to build a home (or, well, a Secret Base), grow berries, sometimes even cook – why didn’t this happen a decade ago, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing</a> was blowing up on the 3DS?</p>
<p>*exhale* Now I have that off of my chest, I can succumb to the excitement that, yes, my dream Pokémon game is <em>finally</em> happening. And the possibilities are endless.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/95b47c07bc782/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the blocky nature of the island first brought to mind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, Pokopia’s co-developer actually reveals something more exciting. Koei Tecmo — this being the dev’s second time working with the franchise after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_conquest">Pokémon Conquest</a> — were co-developers on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>. This blends the sandbox nature of Minecraft and other open-world crafting and building games with RPG elements, narrative, and that distinctive Dragon Quest charm.</p>
<p>This feels like the perfect starting point for Pokopia, and we’re already seeing the weirder side of Pokémon. In case you’ve already forgotten, you’re playing a Ditto that’s masquerading as a human. I was a little unsettled looking at the main character’s face for the first time, but this is actually a genius idea. After all, Pokémon can’t talk, and humans can’t understand Pokémon.</p>
<p>But Ditto <em>can</em>, and that allows the Pokémon to not only have voices, but personalities. I don’t expect anything wild, but merely an acknowledgement of their types, their potential, and their own skills. We’ve already seen that with Bulbasaur and Charmander, with the former telling Ditto what he likes (surprise! It’s grass) and the latter warning Ditto about his fiery tail. It’s simple, but adorable at the same time.</p>

<p>There’s so much potential here. Just looking at the key art, Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan are relaxing under the waterfall, Scyther and Pinsir are squabbling next to the Pokémon Center, and Sudowoodo is standing in between rows of trees, blocking the path. These things all make sense, either based on the Pokémon’s behaviour in previous games or on their inspirations.</p>
<p>These Pokémon all have individual needs that need catering to; we’ve seen at least one ‘mon from every era (except <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Sun &amp; Moon</a>) so far, and that just blows open the potential for creativity and needs. Pidgey is probably going to want something a little different from Rookidee, after all; trees will be part of the equation, surely, but Rookidee is described as “brave and reckless” according to its <a href="http://pokemon.com/us/pokedex/rookidee">Pokédex entry</a>, while <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/pidgey">Pidgey</a> is “docile”. You really think they’d be happy with all the same conditions?</p>
<p>That’s what excites me the most about Pokopia – the idea that you’ll need to juggle the wants of many Pokémon while creating your idea of paradise. I already love that you can basically build a miniature Route, complete with a Pokémon Center and ladders to climb up, with other biomes like forests and mountains just sitting on the outskirts, <em>just</em> like a mainline Pokémon game.</p>

<p>My favourite thing about Pokémon has long been the ecology of the ‘mons living in these worlds. It’s why I loved <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/pokemon_snap">Pokémon Snap</a> as a kid, and adore <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_pokemon_snap">New Pokémon Snap</a> as an adult. You can see where these creatures flourish, how they interact with the world, and how they live with others of their own kind. This is just another way of seeing these fictional creatures exist in a world – except this time, it’s up to you to understand what they need, rather than simply observe them in their environments.</p>
<p>You may already know <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-hd-2d-might-be-old-news-but-octopath-0s-city-building-has-me-buzzing">I love city builders</a> and making towns that I, and others, will come to call home. And eventually you can do just that here, too – I don’t know if The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/pokemon-pokopia-arriving-in-2026">is referring to a town</a> as the ‘islands’ we get to create, or if we’ll be able to build more than Centers and cute little leaf cottages. I mean, surely Ampharos wants a lighthouse somewhere. <em>Surely</em> Magnetite and Voltorb need a Power Plant. Some of those Electric-type Pocket Monsters need those cityscapes to flourish in!</p>
<p>Plus, Ditto needs abilities that cover every type, right? Ditto’s building capabilities all come from the different Pokémon you can bring to your island; grass patches don’t just grow on their own, they need a little Leafage action inspired by Bulbasaur. Does this mean <em>all</em> tall grass in Pokémon is grown by Bulbasaur…? Don’t think about that too much.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/313bd0b9319ca/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with a little crafting table to build furniture, Ditto’s decorating and terraforming all seems to come from individual Pokémon abilities. Scyther can obviously cut down trees with its huge blades, so Ditto takes cues from the big bug for that. My favourite has to be what appears to be Hitmonlee’s ability; I wasn’t sure how Fighting-types could influence the shape of the world, but physically punching cliffs and raised platforms? Sure, why not?</p>
<p>The idea that this is just a slice of what Pokopia may have to offer has me a little bit giddy. The day/night cycle that’s in sync with real-world time (just like in older Pokémon games) has me hoping for seasonal events, and the tease of “in-game locations with their own unique characteristics” makes me wonder about the types of biomes or interiors we’ll be able to explore.</p>
<p>I need pinching, honestly. I like to keep my expectations in check, and I’ve been burned by Pokémon many times throughout my life. But a Pokémon life sim has long been a no-brainer for me. Now we’re getting one, I simply have to wait and hope for what could be my perfect Pokémon game.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
This afternoon, a choice of two raging videogame lawsuits to report on. Firstly, a snippet from the on-going courtroom scrap between former Unknown Worlds executives and Krafton over the state of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s development, in which the former accuse the latter of changing their story about why the executives were fired.</p>
<p>I've decided not to write that one up because it feels like we are entering the realm of potshots over minutiae, rather than learning anything genuinely new about Subnautica 2 or its creators, but if you're interested, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-inc-versus-subnautica-2-former-lead-developers">GamesIndustry.biz has your back</a>. The parallel Tencent/Sony bust-up has the virtue of relative novelty. It gives me a whole <em>different</em> kind of headache. What's going on with this one, then?
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Well, last November Tencent announced that they would publish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light Of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic adventure featuring robot mammoths, archery, red-haired ladies, and scrapmetal tribal aesthetics. An ungenerous commenter might assert that it's a "slavish clone" of Sony's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. That's what Sony called it, anyway, when they announced in July this year that they were going to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">sue Tencent back to the Neo-Stone Age for copyright infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
In their California federal court filing, Sony alleged that Tencent had, in fact, approached them in 2024 and pitched a new Horizon game under license, even as development continued on Light of Motiram. As James noted in our write-up, the implication here is that Tencent were going to make their very own Horizon game regardless of whether Sony consented to brand it an official sequel or spin-off. 
</p><p>
Sony sought to block Light Of Motiram's release, arguing that it would cause "irreparable harm to SIE and the consuming public", which is rather histrionic. I am picturing a solitary tear rolling down the face of a member of the Consuming Public as they plead with the storekeeper that they wanted the <em>other</em> 6/10 metal dinosaur game, not this one. Yes, it is I - the Horizon disliker. Still, I can't deny that the games look rather similar, and it's telling that Tencent have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">edited Light Of Motiram's Steam page</a> to remove some of the more obvious points of overlap with Horizon.
</p>
<p>
Tencent have now hit back against Sony's accusations with even louder language. They contend that Sony are seeking "an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", and that Light Of Motiram ain't even finished yet and as such, can't be fairly assessed for what it invents or borrows. They also say that Sony are suing the wrong people. 
</p>
<p>
As passed on by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">The Game Post</a>, Tencent's motion to dismiss the case comments that "at bottom, Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain." 
</p>
<p>
Tencent further argue that Sony's claims for Horizon Zero Dawn's originality have been "flatly contradicted" by developers Guerrilla, citing a behind-the-scenes doc in which art director Jan-Bart Van Beek compared the game to Ninja Theory's 2013 action-adventure Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. They also make reference to "the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolise through this lawsuit". 
</p><p>
They insist that Light Of Motiram "merely employs the same time-honoured tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon - like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>: Primal, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-new-dawn">Far Cry: New Dawn</a>, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more". In summary, they accuse Sony of trying to "transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets."
</p>
<p>
As regards Sony's argument that Tencent wanted to make a Horizon game for them, and decided to proceed with their "slavish clone" despite not being given permission, Tencent's court motion refers to a GDC meeting from March 2024 in which Tencent reps pitched a licensed Horizon mobile game. They claim that since no actual Tencent executives or employees were at the meeting, nothing at the meeting "is alleged to be an act of copyright or trademark infringement".
</p>
<p>
As for the 'suing the wrong people stuff', Tencent's motion notes that Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, whereas Light Of Motiram is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, who operate under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as 'Tencent Games' and/or 'Level Infinite'". Tencent's lawyers are of the opinion that "Sony's threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue."
</p>
<p>
I'm no lawyer, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">belated efforts to educate myself</a>, but the last two paragraphs read to me like Tencent are trying to get off on a technicality. I sympathise more with the line about Horizon not being as original as all that, and certain ideas being public property. Except that I'm pretty sure that if the roles were reversed and Light of Motiram had launched before Horizon: Zero Dawn, Tencent would have been yelling blue murder about breach of copyright.</p><p>The discussion of what Light Of Motiram - out 2027 - yoinks or doesn't yoink from Horizon is kind of fun to follow, because it's comparing ideas and aesthetics. In general, though, I default to the position that picking sides in a copyright spat between two billion dollar videogame publishers is like deciding which cybernetic T-Rex you most want to step on you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve played a lot of zombie games, and while I often enjoy them a great deal, rarely do I find myself stopping to gawk at the scenery. But I’ve been doing that a lot in Techland’s latest open-world zombie RPG,<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-dying-light-the-beast-kyle-crane-1851627150"> Dying Light: The Beast</a>.</em> Setting a game like this in the Swiss Alps is fantastic. But even if this game was set in a much less pretty locale, I’d still be super into it as it feels like the culmination of a decade-plus of Techland making these kinds of RPG zombie adventures. Just don’t pay too close attention to the main story.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-delay-techland-1851786943"><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></a> was originally envisioned and pitched as a big DLC expansion for 2022’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-2-kotaku-review-zombie-techland-open-world-1848456376"><em>Dying Light 2</em>.</a> But it got bigger and bigger, and eventually Techland made the call to turn it into its own standalone adventure. The game, out now on Xbox, PS5, and PC, continues the story of<em> Dying Light’</em>s OG protagonist, Kyle Crane. A lot has happened to our gruff mercenary who is also surprisingly good at parkour.</p> <p>Now, after over a decade of torture and experimentation, Crane is a half-human/half-zombie monster super-dude who can rip the undead limb from limb. And with this newfound power and some allies, Crane plans on taking down the bastard who was in charge of experimenting on him and others. And in the process, maybe saving some people stranded in the Swiss Alps in an area known as Castor Woods.</p>

 <p>After spending about 7 hours with the new game, I can say the main plot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671"><em> Dying Light: The Beas</em>t</a> is easily the weakest part of the package. It’s very goofy and dumb and feels like it was created simply to explain Kyle’s new “Beast Mode” powers. It gets the job done, but it ain’t anything to write home about. Luckily, almost everything else in<em> Dying Light: The Beast</em> is much, much better.</p> <h2>Hoppin’ And Choppin’ All Day</h2> <p>As with the previous <em>Dying Light</em> games, <em>The Beast</em> is a first-person open-world zombie RPG focused on melee combat and parkour-inspired exploration and platforming. And it’s clear that Techland has built on its years of experience making this kind of game in this engine, as <em>The Beast</em> is just a joy to play. Running, sliding, jumping, climbing, and hopping around Castor Woods is a treat. It’s one of those games in which traversing from one quest marker to the next is such a joy that you don’t mind how mundane or silly the actual objective at the end is.</p>

 <p>This new map, which is roughly the size of the OG <em>Dying Light’</em>s world, is filled with things to grab onto or mantle over or hop off of or slide through. It’s like a constant and very satisfying puzzle to figure out how to reach your next objective or avoid some massive crowd of zombies who want to kill you. It’s also just so damn pretty. The snowy mountains and fall-like vibes are almost cozy, until a big zombie monster attacks and ruins the vibes.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626877"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626877">©Techland / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The melee combat in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> isn’t much different than what can be found in <em>Dying Light 2</em> or the original game, but I’m very happy about that. Those past games nailed first-person melee action, and <em>The Beast</em> just tweaks a few things to make the experience better. For example, weapons now visually deteriorate as you use them more, something that was lost in<em> Dying Light 2</em>. Meanwhile, swings can knock enemies back farther and feel more gnarly, too. Slamming a zombie’s head off with a sledgehammer never gets old.</p>

 <p>I still find the crafting in <em>Dying Light: The Beast,</em> which returns from past games, to be a bit finicky and annoying. But it’s worth dealing with so you can craft a flaming machete that tears through undead as quickly and as disgustingly as I consume a bag of Taco Bell quesadillas.</p> <h2>I’m Shifting Into Beast Mode</h2> <p>The big new feature in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is Crane’s ability to activate his latent monster powers and go full beast mode on zombies and human enemies alike. You earn beast juice—that’s what I call it—by attacking enemies and taking damage. Get enough, and Crane can turn into a hyper-fast, super-powerful, and extremely deadly killing machine, able to rip zombie arms off and punch clean through their chests. Going beast mode is always a blast in this game, especially when you use it to rip apart a big horde of zombies that were about to kill you.</p>

  <p>As you play through the main campaign, you go toe-to-toe with special infected bosses that each offer unique fights. I fought one of these bosses that covered the area in fog and used other zombies to her advantage. These powerful foes provide Crane with Beast Points (stop laughing), which let you upgrade the Beast powers even further. I’m only about seven hours into the game, and I already feel like, in my Beast form, I could take on any threat. Well, maybe not the super zombies that come out at night.</p> <p>Yes, once again, the deadliest enemies in the game return to chase Crane around as he tries to complete side quests and loot valuable locations after the sun has gone down. These encounters and moments in which the game forces Crane into dark, creepy caves and buildings are genuinely scary and turn <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> into a pseudo-horror game, complete with some jump scares. Be careful at night.</p>

 <p>Even though I haven’t finished the game, from what I’ve played so far, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> feels like the culmination of a decade-plus of Techland developing open-world zombie games. Its open world is gorgeous and so much fun to explore. Combat feels great, and moving around the world is better than ever.<a href="https://x.com/muaxh03/status/1968437323147730997"> Techland has even brought back some smaller elements</a> from <em>Dying Light 1</em>,<a href="https://x.com/muaxh03/status/1968083614585045494"> like how enemies react to attacks</a>, making <em>The Beast</em> feel like the studio’s strongest swing at this type of game. The storyline is silly, but I do enjoy going full wild mode and killing a dozen zombies, so I’ll ignore how often it’s made me roll my eyes.</p> <p>Regardless, if the rest of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is as good as what I’ve played so far, this will likely be on my Game of the Year list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When setting out on my fourth journey of leaping across rooftops while slicing zombies in twain via the Dying Light series, I’d wondered if I’d feel any less joy from this violent survival horror-parkour this time. But after another 40+ hours of tucking and rolling I’m pleasantly surprised to say it’s still loads of fun, despite the basics not having changed much at all since 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human. This trip through undead Eurasian cities and countrysides does up the ante somewhat by having you play as a human infused with a monster’s DNA, giving you the ability to rip people’s heads off with your bare hands. That’s as satisfying as it is unsettling, and it’s still absolutely horrifying to get caught out at night and get swarmed by Volatiles you’ve no hope of defeating. The only major disappointment is that The Beast doesn’t add a whole lot aside from its hulking out mechanics, and after a decade of games with few innovations, that hasn’t left room for a ton of surprises. Still, there’s something to be said for a reliably entertaining series, and I happily dug my fingernails through every side quest and climbing puzzle I could find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequel continues the story of the first game’s protagonist, Kyle Crane, who through a series of quite gruesome events he’s been transformed into a half-man, half-beast monstrosity capable of leaping 50 feet in the air and screaming so loud it makes the undead take psychic damage… so, still very weird. There’s not much more than that to the paper-thin plot, which has you squaring off against the world’s most generic Bond villain and mad scientist on a revenge quest that goes down exactly like you think it does, but it’s at least a good enough excuse to hunt down bosses and engage with the side quests that are usually better written and sometimes downright silly. Plus, even though the story is about as minimum effort as it gets, the characters you meet and befriend along the way are at least memorable enough that I didn’t feel like skipping the lengthy conversations where you get to know them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you sprint toward your final confrontation (which took my completionist self about 40 hours, but could pretty easily be done in under 20), you power yourself up by hunting dangerous, genetically modified zombies with super powers called Chimeras and injecting yourself with their blood. This is where the main new mechanics of The Beast comes into play, like the ability to shoulder-charge through a crowd of zombies without breaking a sweat and really silly ones like one where you can change directions in mid air by yanking on your grapple hook with obscene force. Turning yourself into a Hulk-like abomination in the pursuit of revenge makes for a neat twist to an already awesome framework, and being able to throw down your machete and punch 20 zombies to death in the span of 10 seconds is quite satisfying.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve played a Dying Light before, the majority of your time will feel familiar.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, even this is a fairly small tweak to the established Dying Light blueprint, as you only get to go full werewolf every so often after you’ve charged up your rage meter from taking and dealing damage. For the rest of the time you’re still swinging lead pipes and running away from Volatiles per usual, so if you’ve played a Dying Light game before the vast majority of your playtime will feel quite familiar. That’s by no means a bad thing since it’s a reminder of some good times, but it does seem like a bit of a run/jump/slide down memory lane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other thing that makes The Beast distinct from its predecessors is the boss fights against souped-up infected that unlock your new abilities. The first time you come across each of these encounters it introduces a new type of baddie that then starts showing up in the wild, like a fast-moving skeletal zombie that leaps through the air, dances on top of lesser undead, and tackles you with sharp claws in the blink of an eye; or another where a muscular, brutish ghoul gains the ability to turn invisible, leaving you frantically looking over your shoulder and listening for growls in the dark. They’re cool the first time, but by the end of the campaign it feels a bit like they ran out of steam because they start rolling out variations of the same bosses you fought prior, like a muscular, brutish zombie whose only differentiated by his gas mask and weakness to poison. Still, they’re always at least entertaining highlights along the way – I mean, who doesn’t love a boss fight?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: The Beast - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The open-world valley of Castor Woods is the new setting you’ll spend all your time in while seeking your revenge, and it combines time-worn elements we’ve seen in other Dying Light games into a cozy little package. It’s got spacious rural areas reminiscent of the original’s The Following expansion, as well as a city area with plenty of stone structures to scramble up. Castor Woods is fairly small compared to the sprawling maps of Dying Light and its first sequel, and you can definitely see the roots of The Beast being originally conceived as an expansion to Dying Light 2 when you run into the mountains that box you into a circular area that can be crossed by car in a couple minutes, but that’s not such a bad thing since they make good use of the space they’ve got without large expanses of emptiness padding it out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also includes what any good Dying Light game needs: When in the major urban area I was reminded of the virtues of sticking to the rooftops and leaping from place to place to avoid the hordes below, and while stepping out into the woods and swamps that make up the majority of the map I tried my best to make use of cars to bash my way to my destination and avoid getting caught out in the open. Like a lot of The Beast, everything about Castor Woods is perfectly acceptable while also not doing a whole lot to stand out, but I still made plenty of new memories while leaving a terrifying path of destruction in my wake.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Top Zombie Games</h3><p>If you want to fight brain-eaters, look no further than TieGuyTravis' top picks from the genre.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I do have to hand it to Techland for making The Beast the most technically sound Dying Light game yet – I was able to get through without major or consistent bugs along the way. I played on my high-end PC, so likely got just about the best experience one could hope for, but it’s notable that aside from one crash and a bit of pop-in here and there, it was a pretty smooth ride throughout – and that’s with me having mostly played before the day-one patch, too. There were a few annoying moments where I got stuck in a vent due to some buggy geometry and couldn’t progress through the area until I’d jiggled my character around for a couple of minutes, and a few times where my character got stuck in the environment at the worst possible time and jeopardized my mission, but these were rare enough situations that they didn’t make me want to hulk out and throw things at the screen.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Dying Light: The Beast is an entertaining return to the rooftops and flesh pits I’ve come to love over the past decade. The gimmick of amping yourself up into a scary monster to fight other monsters sticks the landing and mostly makes up for a generic story and a map that has few surprises in store. However, aside from your new rampaging abilities and some freaky new boss fights, The Beast does stick pretty close to what worked in the last two games, so it may feel a bit rote to those who have played those recently. Its signature blend of parkour and melee-focused combat remains largely the same, but there’s certainly nothing wrong with having more Dying Light.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-review]]></content:encoded>

As Nintendo is wont to do, the company is also releasing a pair of amiibo figures to go along with the new game. There’s a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMwe4?object_uuid=247b1819-8275-43fd-9c34-4b852f023952&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirby and Warp Star amiibo</a> and a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrw6p?object_uuid=247b1819-8275-43fd-9c34-4b852f023952&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bandana Waddle Dee and Winged Star</a>. They both retail for (a somewhat shocking) $49.99, and are set to release the same day as the game itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for the extra expense is that these are more elaborate than most amiibo figures. With each of them, you get a character and a vehicle that work together in interesting ways, particularly if you have both figures. Read on for the details.</p><p id="kirby-and-warp-star"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Kirby and Warp Star">Kirby and Warp Star amiibo - Kirby Air Riders Series</h2></p><p id="bandana-waddle-dee-and-winged-star"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bandana Waddle Dee and Winged Star">Bandana Waddle Dee and Winged Star amiibo - Kirby Air Riders Series</h2></p><p id="how-these-amiibo-work"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="How these amiibo work">How the Kirby Air Riders amiibo Work</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So how do these things work, exactly? When you put Kirby on the Warp Star vehicle and tap it on your Switch 2 controller, it creates an in-game Figure Player (think NPC) that will race around the tracks in your matches. As the FP competes in races, it will level up, and its machine proficiency level will also increase. (Machine proficiency is basically a score for that character-and-vehicle combo).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have both of the above amiibo figures, you can swap riders on the vehicles. That way, you can have an FP of Kirby riding on the Winged Star, or Bandana Waddle Dee riding on the Warp Star. When you do this, the FP character maintains its level, but starts from zero in its machine proficiency since it’s a new vehicle. You can watch the video above to see it in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo says more of these Kirby Air Riders amiibo will be released in the future, creating more character/machine combinations for your FPs. Also, Nintendo is planning a second Kirby Air Riders Direct hosted by Sakurai, during which he may offer additional details about these (and upcoming) amiibo.</p><p id="preorder-kirby-air-riders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder Kirby Air Riders">Preorder Kirby Airy Riders</h2></p><div catalogid="011f803d-35ed-467e-be69-95e40a6bb8fd" id="227102"><div id="227102" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kirby Airy Riders</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are getting the amiibo, then surely you'll want the game, which can be purchased above.

                <p>Several games offer the chance to explore real-world locations, but the upcoming Pigeon: A Love Story will make you realize just how big a city can really be. Revealed during the Six One Indie showcase, Pigeon: A Love Story does exactly what it says on the box: You're a pigeon, and you're looking for your life-partner inside of a densely populated metropolitan area like Paris, London, or New York.</p><p>Not only is each "global pigeon hub" rendered completely to scale, but they're also populated with an "accurate number of pigeons" as well, developer Alex Taylor added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpi745LhaT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wpi745LhaT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Described as a slow game for fast times, Pigeon: A Love Story will allow players to explore every building, every street, and every pigeon in a real-time, city-wide simulation. Hundreds of thousands of autonomous pigeon NPCs are flying around, and if the task of finding a feathery soulmate sounds almost impossible, you can team up with a friend to collaborate, compete, or try to find one another.</p><p>There's even a zen aspect to the romantic adventure, as you can choose to let the game play itself--screensaver-style--and enjoy some digital birdwatching. There's even a chill soundtrack to add some lo-fi vibes to the experience.</p><p>While this isn't the first game to focus on pigeons--remember Hatoful Boyfriend--it is an ambitious title aiming to simulate the romantic pursuits of these birds. A release date hasn't been set yet, but it will launch for PC via Steam.</p>

                <p>Late last year, players noted that images of Tencent's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/light-of-motiram/" data-ref-id="5000-652952">Light of Motiram</a>, had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">a very striking resemblance</a> to Sony's Horizon games. Sony noticed as well and subsequently filed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493"> a lawsuit against Tencent</a>. Now, Tencent is arguing that Sony's lawsuit has no merit and that the case against it should be dismissed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, Tencent's motion to dismiss accuses Sony of attempting to "fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain." Tencent's position is that Sony's claim that Horizon Zero Dawn is "like no fictional world created before [or] since" is contradicted by the game's developers and represents an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</p><p>Tencent notes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> art director Jan-Bart Van Beek acknowledged the game's similarity to an earlier title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/" data-ref-id="5000-56869">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>, in a behind-the-scenes documentary. According to Tencent, Sony originally shelved Horizon over those similarities before ultimately producing the game.</p><p>Sony's original complaint cited a March 2024 meeting between the company and Tencent about a potential Horizon spin-off mobile game that was ultimately rejected by Sony. Tencent's motion to dismiss acknowledges that a meeting took place, but states, "no Tencent Holdings executives or employees were at this meeting," and adds that "Sony has failed to make a prima facie showing that any actions at this meeting caused harm to Sony."</p><p>The motion goes on to state that Tencent Holdings, Tencent America, and Proxima Beta U.S. should be dismissed from the lawsuit because Sony "cannot [specifically] substantiate the claims it brings against [them]." Light of Motiram is being developed by two Tencent-affliliated companies, Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd., a subsidy based in Singapore.</p><p>Tencent also states that since Light of Motiram hasn't been released, "the alleged infringements have not occurred and may in fact never occur."</p><p>Shortly after Sony filed the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">Tencent changed several elements</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light of Motiram's Steam page</a>, and the Horizon-like imagery was removed. Light of Motiram is expected to be released in 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>1st Selkie Platoon</span><span>|</span><span><p>The 1st Selkie Platoon using a Halo mod for Arma 3</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I spawned on a moon base in <em>Arma 3</em>. My role was a rifleman, and I held some extra ammo for the rest of my squad. I put on my armor, which had “PRESS” written in white across the chest piece. Outside the base’s walls was the surface of a moon, which had a thin atmosphere and low gravity. I wasn’t going to be able to hear gunshots or footsteps while outside.</p><p>After being slowed down by technical issues, we were briefed on the mission. Stellarynn, my squad leader and the founder of the 1st Selkie Platoon, asked everyone to open their maps, and we took a look at our objectives. We were to advance on a base occupied by pirates and find a server room. Once there, we would find a way to connect servers to a huge railgun to target the orbiting pirates’ ship. We’d then get to the railgun, bait the pirates into attacking us, turn it on, and blow up their ship.</p><p>“We will convert haters to craters,” Stella said.</p><p>We formed up and got ready to move out.</p><p>I’ve always loved military simulation video games. There’s something uniquely special about strategizing, navigating the realistic mechanics, and working as a team, all with your heart pumping because one well-placed enemy bullet could knock you out of the game and ruin your plans.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Arma 3</em> might be the best game to seek that thrill, but it comes with challenges too. Milsim games can be overwhelmingly masculine. When I play public servers in the modern combat milsim<em> </em><a href="https://www.joinsquad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squad</em></a>, I have to grit my teeth and bear racial and anti-LGBTQ+ slurs. While I feel discomfort and annoyance in these games as a cis, white bisexual man, other players have to act or speak certain ways, or not speak at all, to avoid harassment or worse.&nbsp;</p><p>So upon receiving an invite from Stella to play with the 1st Selkie Platoon, her trans women-only unit, I was excited to not only meet them, but to learn how they navigated a game dominated by cisgender men.&nbsp;</p><p>Stella told me that she doesn’t play <em>Squad </em>and that, when she plays public servers in milsims, she stays quiet.</p><p>“I avoid using microphones in [other milsim games],” she said. “I’ve got friends who have played <em>Squad</em> and do use the microphone and all that, and some of them have absolutely had various forms of bigotry leveled their way.”</p><p>The milsim community – and gaming in general – struggles with something Stella calls “assumed maleness.” It’s the idea that another player is a cis male by default until that player asserts otherwise. The key is “asserts” – other players won’t always click your profile and see your pronouns, she said.</p><p>“Even when I’ve got my profile picture that is a picture of my face with long hair, bangs, and makeup on, I will still get ‘he/him’s in a conversation unless pronouns are in my username,” Stella said.</p><p>For the 1st Selkie Platoon, that idea is “flipped,” she said; everybody in the Discord server is assumed to be a woman by default. This helps trans women who might not feel comfortable talking because they have a deep voice feel safer doing so.</p><p>“There’s a lot of girls who basically have said [that] they’ve never really spoken in any kind of voice channels before because they don’t feel comfortable anywhere else,” Stella said. “But this space was an exception.”</p><h2><strong>"Everybody in this server is like, 'I deserve respect</strong>'"</h2><p>Before the Selkies, Stella was in another unit where it was hers, she said, “in all but name,” run by someone else who was more of a “figurehead” and was “being rude to some of the people” and driving them away.</p><p>So Stella decided to make her own unit, which came together last January. The Selkies use a more casual structure than some other units. Before a mission, players choose roles in different squads. Squad leaders are determined from a de facto list of people who like to lead, but others are encouraged to step outside of their comfort zone.</p><p>“Because we aren’t very strict, we tend to encourage people to try new things,” she said. “Some days, somebody’s had a long day at work [and] doesn’t want to [lead], so we’ll kind of swap the team structure a little bit.”</p><p>Tuesdays are when the group plays their operations, which bring in the most players. Operations are similar to one-shots in tabletop roleplaying games: usually scripted missions developed by a player, with someone — usually the mission maker — as the “game master” called Zeus. Some units have multiple mission makers, but the Selkies have just Stella, who makes the mission, takes command, and acts as&nbsp; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275700/Arma_3_Zeus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zeus</a>.</p><p>Though Stella makes the missions, other members have contributed through modding. The 1st Selkie Platoon has an overarching story in an alternate timeline diverging at the end of <em>Halo 3</em>, so those additional mods help enhance the experience.</p><p>“We’ve got custom lore, and we’re fighting against enemies that are like our own custom version of these groups where it’s all kind of coming together to tell that story,” Stella said. “People are matching the amount of effort that I’m putting in, which is awesome to see.”</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>There isn’t a vetting process to join the Selkies, but Stella said she and two other moderators conduct a “vibe check” when they speak to someone who’s interested. Usually, Stella finds interested players on sites like Tumblr and talks to them for a little bit before extending an invite. That’s enough to keep any bad actors from getting in so far, she said.</p><p>And if they do get in, they’re joining a server “full of very outspoken trans women,” she said.</p><p>“Everybody in this server is like, ‘I deserve respect and I will fight for respect, and if I’m not respected, I will end communication with people,’” Stella said. “Everybody in that server deserves to take up as much space as somebody who is not a trans woman. That is just a fact of life. We deserve the same respect as any other person, and if somebody’s going to disagree with that, they’re going to find that they’re disagreed with very often.”</p><p>The Selkies provide more than just <em>Arma 3 </em>operations. They have roles in their Discord for other games, and Friday nights are a non-<em>Arma</em> game night. Stella’s vision is for the 1st Selkie Platoon to be a casual space like any other.</p><p>That the space is casual is important to her, because queer spaces can sometimes open “a floodgate” of repressed sexuality that can finally be expressed, Stella said. The Discord keeps NSFW jokes and comments to “an absolute minimum within reason” to keep everyone comfortable.</p><p>“There are people who are not necessarily comfortable with that, and we don’t want anybody feeling like she can’t speak up because the conversation will get derailed into people being horny again,” she said. “It means that people can feel comfortable just forming friendships and there’s no pressure.”</p><p>Those rules have worked “wonderfully,” she said. Conversations are kept civil — even in the Discord’s politics channel.</p><p>The unit is growing, too. When I spoke first to Stella in July, she said about 15 people come to their big operations. Now, the number is closer to 20-25, and the Discord just hit 70 members.</p><p>Stella feels like with every mission, she is “perpetually underestimating” how many people will show. But seeing the growth, she said, is “fantastic.”</p><p>“I keep low-balling myself,” she said. “Then everybody’s standing in front of me, and [I’m] like, ‘Wow.’”</p><h2><strong>Getting briefed</strong></h2><p>To accept Stella’s invitation to join the operation, I had to set up a slew of mods to join the server, ranging from one called <a href="https://ace3.acemod.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE</a>, which makes the game even <em>more </em>realistic through wound management and absurdly accurate ballistics. To communicate with my squad, I installed TaskForce Radio, a mod that accurately replicates radios and adds higher-quality proximity chat with the help of <a href="https://www.teamspeak.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TeamSpeak</a> (yes, it’s still around!). The Selkies don’t play the default near-future modern military gear; they run milsims in the world of <em>Halo</em> using an overhaul called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769440155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Trebuchet</a>. Players cannot change their character’s gender to female in the game, so some use a mod called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2021778690&amp;searchtext=Timberwolf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Task Force TimberWolf Female Characters</a> for female heads.</p><p>I wasn’t the only one newcomer to this op. Joining me was a player who goes by Myra, a new member of the Selkies who was attending eir first op.</p><p>The 24-year-old was first introduced to <em>Halo 2</em> by eir “nerdy parents” when e was 5, Myra told me. Myra bought <em>Arma 2</em> after watching the YouTube channel FRANKIEonPC play it nearly 13 years ago. But Myra only played solo and casual multiplayer, and e didn’t start to explore unit-based multiplayer options until <em>Arma 3</em> in 2019.</p><p>“<em>Arma</em> has permanently earned a soft spot in my heart,” Myra said.</p><p>Myra played online with cis men before coming out, but throughout this time was testing eir gender by dressing as more female presenting. It was a feeling Myra had felt since middle school, but e didn’t come out until last year.</p><p>“It was definitely hard to want to come out,” Myra said. “I was comfortable with the mediocrity of not having things change, though the change would be really good for me.”</p><p>In another squad was Aurelia. Aurelia first got interested in military roleplaying through a <em>Mass Effect </em>RP server in <em>Garry’s Mod</em>. She came out in 2018, and made her way to <em>Arma</em> around 7 years ago, where she continued her roleplaying interest in the 81st Arachnids, a <em>Halo</em> unit. That unit started as a bunch of friends, but it began to expand and needed someone to help manage the community. That’s where Aurelia came in – and where she was accepted as a woman by a community for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>“[They gave] me a place to be a part of the community — to be such a ‘pillar,’ as they have said to me,” she said.</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>The 81st Arachnids was retired not long after Aurelia joined. But Aurelia, along with her friends Red and Blue, created a new unit called the 137th Wolf Pack Battalion. Roleplay became even heavier, with operations weaving in storylines from different characters that players inhabited. While the 81st Arachnids was accepting, 137th Wolf Pack Battalion was made with the intent to be queer-friendly.</p><p>The 81st Arachnids helped Aurelia feel safe and comfortable, even though the outside world wasn’t as accepting.</p><p>“ I was kind of stuck in college and [had] parents that were not even remotely supportive,” she said. “I had a really hard time in my IRL life coming out [and] socially transitioning.”</p><p>Joining the op was a woman who wasn’t a regular member of the Selkies, May. The 20-year-old is in her own group made up of trans women called Purple Team, one of the very few units who not only play as Spartans from <em>Halo</em>, but to roleplay as them — like a specialized acting troupe. Other <em>Halo</em> units ask a Spartan unit like Purple Team to join their ops to provide an authentic Spartan experience to members of a unit.</p><p>Though she now is embedded within the Operation Trebuchet community, May joined her first <em>Halo</em> unit in 2020 when she was 16 years old. She began to experiment with her gender identity six months later, and hopped from unit to unit. <em>Arma 3</em> provided May with the opportunity to use her strengths in organization. She refers to herself as a “paper jockey” — she likes writing documentation like new player handbooks and training manuals.</p><p>“It’s one of the few games I feel like I can play endlessly and not get tired,” May said. “[<em>Arma 3</em>] is by far what I put the most amount of time and effort into, and enjoy the most doing.”</p><h2>"You can kind of tell this isn’t quite a safe space"</h2><p>Six months after May joined her first unit, she wore eyeliner in her Discord profile picture and changed her pronouns to they/them. The change caught the attention of one of the members. May recalled that member, a regular, saying that she “used too much” eyeliner and was getting “really aggressive.”</p><p>“Pretty much any time I spoke, he would tell me to get the fuck out,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>The member’s harassment made May feel some doubt about her gender identity, she said. She felt like she couldn’t leave the unit easily because it was the first one she joined, but a couple months later, she finally left.&nbsp;</p><p>After she left, an adult member of the unit reached out to her. May said the member encouraged her transition, but that after she turned 17, he joined her new unit, groomed her into a relationship, and later sexually assaulted her when they met in person. A week after the assault, May said the member sent her a message implying that he wanted to hurt her.</p><p>May reported the incident to her unit’s leadership. She said leadership banned the player and promised to work on blacklisting him from the particular game’s community, but that, according to a friend of May’s, the unit did not communicate with other units about the danger the player posed.&nbsp;</p><p>“I left [the unit] ‘cause that is just no longer a safe place for me to be in if they’re lying to my face about that,” May said.</p><p>Aurelia described how putting her pronouns in her Discord bio made players treat her differently. When joining a unit, she does “a lot of sleuthing” to tell if a unit is a safe space for her or not.</p><p>“Joining [a] unit, you get to look through some of the things that have been said in the unit, and you can kind of tell this isn’t quite a safe space,” Aurelia said.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>Aurelia had joined another <em>Halo</em> unit where she said she met some “really awesome people,” but ran into some “really bad eggs” as well. One player in particular, she says, was “just given a pass to be a bad person.”</p><p>“They made some very inappropriate comments towards me on my first day joining the unit,” Aurelia recalled. “When that happened to me, and I told people about it, they just basically shrugged and said, ‘Oh well, that’s Person, that’s what they do.’”</p><p>“I made a big fuss about it for like a month,” Aurelia said. “It was one of the first, like, negative experiences that I really took a stand for instead of just leaving, and I’m so glad that I did because I got to meet a whole lot of really good people. I really got to help improve that community in a way, which is awesome. But, you know, I got to learn a whole lot about what it means to just let somebody do what they want in that way, and [it] certainly made me feel a little uncomfortable.”</p><p>But Aurelia also understood some of the dynamics at play of why such “bad eggs” had trouble being removed from a community — they’re people’s friends. It’s hard to call out a friend when they fuck up, Aurelia said.</p><p>“I can see across the fence, and it’s hard to want to look at your friend and say, ‘Hey, that was really fucked up,’” Aurelia said. “A lot of people don’t do that. They won’t call their friends out on that kind of shit.”</p><p>When harassment is spewed on Discord, May said trans women will sometimes be the only members to speak up. But members of a unit can get “unspoken privileges" if they’ve been around long enough as part of a “loyalty system that [leadership] will consider.”</p><p>“In almost all of my experience with <em>Arma</em>, you will not be heard if you are a trans woman,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Masculinity in gaming</strong></h2><p>What some members of the 1st Selkie Platoon experienced in <em>Arma 3</em> is indicative of a wider masculine culture in gaming. Megan Condis, a professor at Texas Tech University who studies intersections of technology and gender, said that she’s seeing a comeback in one of the ways gamers show they are in the “in-group,” through the use of slurs in multiplayer games.</p><p>“Two years ago, I would’ve said that it is no longer considered necessarily a marker of gamer identity or a way that you demonstrate that you’re within the ‘in-group’ of online gaming culture to use those kinds of slurs or to just sort of casually throw around misogynist or homophobic rhetoric,” Condis said.&nbsp;</p><p>She said the lead-up to the 2024 election and the rise of the “manosphere” through streamers and podcasters has reframed that kind of rhetoric. Commentators would argue that they don’t <em>agree </em>with the slurs, but that the censorship of them is a result of the Left and so they use slurs “to emphasize how much [they] care about freedom of speech.” To them, the Left is the “censorious overseer” keeping you, the real gamer, from saying those words, instead of the wider gaming culture disavowing them.</p><p>“‘We need to, on the micro scale, take back gaming culture from these feminist critics or companies that have diversity officers or whatever,’” she described this viewpoint. “‘On the macro scale, we need to take America back from the Woke.’”</p><p>These rhetorical ideas spread in certain spaces more than others, she said.</p><p>“Multiplayer competitive eSports-style spaces are often more steeped in this masculinist communication style — and by that I don’t even necessarily mean that they’re full of men, but everyone who participates is expected to conform to speaking in this particular way or taking this [position],” Condis said.</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, how players are perceived in video games can be influenced by their avatar. In games where a player’s role is designated by a character — such as Tracer in <em>Overwatch</em> — the player is represented by that character.</p><p>“The structure of the game causes you to think less about the person operating the computer and more about the function of the avatar and the abilities the avatar has, whereas a game like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Minecraft</em> even, the players’ avatars are representatives of the player in the game world,” Condis said.</p><p><em>Arma 3</em> has no default customization options for women. You can select military gear and your character’s head and voice, but they are all masculine. This could make players slip into masculine pronouns because that’s the “story of the game” being presented to them, Condis said. Asking whether a player is male or female might not even occur to another player.</p><p>“The assumption is, ‘Of course it’s a guy. Why would I even ask?’ And so then it becomes easy to just slip into that assumption all the time,” she said. “The software doesn’t seem to even consider the possibility that anyone else would be participating.”</p><p>That assumption has leaked into how player communities teach newcomers. May has read handbooks written for new players, and she said many of them are gendered towards men.</p><p>One unit May joined was particularly egregious. “This was prevalent in most documents for that unit, like ‘The soldier will set his gun on full auto. The soldier will throw his grenade. You’ll protect the man in front of you,’” May recalled. “There is absolutely assumed maleness in <em>Arma 3</em>.”</p><h2><strong>“I just want to have some femininity in it</strong>"</h2><p>The players I talked to all espoused how <em>Arma 3</em> has provided them special experiences despite the numerous obstacles thrown at them by other units.</p><p>For Aurelia and Myra, they think if Bohemia Interactive provided female player options, their experiences would improve much more.</p><p>“I just want to have some femininity in it,” Aurelia said. “I don’t want to have this bulky box chest, you know? I wanna feel a little more comfortable and easily identifiable [as a woman] from a distance — a smaller frame, a smaller figure.”</p><p>Myra understands that female player models means additional modeling work for developers in a game that is already trying to make authentic, detailed models. But other modern military shooters – <em>Call of Duty, Battlefield, </em>and the more tactical <em>Insurgency: Sandstorm –</em> are open to representing women in combat roles — why not <em>Arma</em>?</p><p>“When you have a multiplayer experience where [you can modify] player expression, whether it be selecting skin tones, equipment, [faces] and gear, then why not just go that extra mile and give representation for those who have not been given representation in the past, especially in these kinds of communities?” Myra said.</p><p>Myra also wants Bohemia Interactive to add more safeguards against harassment, though e understood how it’s difficult to police a decentralized community. But as Bohemia works on <a href="https://reforger.armaplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Arma Reforger</em></a> — a side-game that’s a sort of testing ground for the team’s new engine — and <em>Arma 4</em>, Myra said multiplayer is becoming more centralized through official servers and the previously PC-exclusive series making its way to consoles.</p><p>“[Safety tools are] definitely something that they need to kind of put serious thought into,” Myra said. “There’s no excuse to not do it anymore.”</p><p>Bohemia Interactive spokesperson Pavel Křižka said the team is “not sharing any details” about <em>Arma 4</em>, but “However, our new technology—the ‘Enfusion engine’—is introducing many new and improved features to help create even more immersive and diverse worlds.” He did not specify whether female player options were part of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>1st Selkie Platoon</figcaption></figure><p>Křižka also said Bohemia is “including built-in mechanisms to report inappropriate behavior.” He said “flagging inappropriate behavior” and kicking players through voting and admin intervention were already available in <em>Arma 3</em>, and those tools would “most probably be evolved” in <em>Arma 4</em>.</p><p>Currently, <em>Arma 3 </em>provides a vote kick option on public servers, but to address any harassment, you have to speak to the community’s admins or moderators in charge of the server.</p><p><em>Arma</em> communities also institute their own rules to manage their communities. As Aurelia joined multiple units over seven years, she came across a familiar rule — don’t talk politics.</p><p>While the rule seems fine on the surface, Aurelia found that when servers have that rule, politics tend to include her own transgender identity. The rule constricts her from feeling like she can be herself, she said.</p><p>“We are all inherently political — that’s what politics has done, like the world has done that to us,” she said. “The LGBTQ+ community is now a political thing because [others have] made it that way.”</p><p>Bohemia Interactive seems to share some of this “no politics” sentiment, according to an answer they gave to me when I asked why their games have not acknowledged or celebrated Pride month. Křižka said the company does not celebrate it, either.</p><p>“As a company, we are strictly apolitical and we do not aim to participate in such global activities,” Křižka told me. “Instead, we focus on creating a pleasant and inspirational working environment in our studio for all people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs.”</p><p>Aurelia said she has seen more and more servers dropping the “no politics” rule. Rather than not talking politics, servers will instead ask to keep any political discussion civil and kind.</p><p>“I like seeing that,” she said. “They’re not trying to erase. They’re just trying to promote healthy discussion.”</p><h2><strong>“It’s a community that is made for the trans community</strong>"</h2><p>Back on the moon, the operation to take over the MAC cannon had an explosive climax. My squad was split between guarding the cannon’s northern gate, while Myra and I held our ground at the entrance into the cannon. The cannon blew up the pirates’ ship — however, the alien Covenant races landed on the moon right after.</p><p>We were outnumbered. The northern gate fell after Stella and my squadmate with a rocket launcher were downed, with their bodies trapped on the other side of the wall. Myra and I shot at the Covenant from a small barricade, but we quickly ran out of ammo. Eventually, we both went down after I accidentally overdosed on morphine and Myra died trying to carry my body to safety.</p><p>I’ve played a lot of milsims, and, on occasion, I have joined units in games like <em>Arma 3</em>. Many of my fellow players were men. There was only one unit that I recalled having trans women. After I left the unit, one of them told me that they were harassed by another player in that unit.</p><p>The 1st Selkies made me recall fond memories of playing in units, coordinating, and planning together. There wasn’t any drama. Our debrief touched on mistakes people made, but those mistakes were always framed in how they could do better next time.</p><p>Stella told me before I joined that she wants the Selkies to feel like a casual unit, just like any other, but one that’s safe for trans women.</p><p>“ We are forming the space to be very much for trans women and for general gaming as well,” she said. “A lot of that is making it a space where we can have a normal relationship with other people and develop friendships.”</p><p>When I asked Aurelia, Myra and May about the Selkies, they only had positive things to say.</p><p>“It’s a community that is made for the trans community,” Aurelia said. “I’ll never find another place that I feel more safe.”</p><p>May plays with the Selkies only occasionally, as she’s focused on developing the Purple Team.

<p>Arriving on Switch next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/absolum">Absolum</a>'s roguelike / beat 'em up fusion since we first went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-absolum-dead-cells-meets-streets-of-rage-4-in-an-effortlessly-stylish-rogue-em-up">hands-on</a> with it earlier this year. Ahead of its launch on <strong>9th October</strong>, publisher and co-developer Dotemu has today revealed a new gameplay trailer, and it looks every bit as stylish as we were expecting.</p>
<p>Aside from giving us a closer look at the fantasy beat 'em up action, the new trailer showcases some of the game's meta progression, helpful additions like co-op and recruitments, and explains how your path through the lands of Talamh can produce permanent game changes.</p>
<p>It's also a nice opportunity to get reacquainted with the four main Absolum heroes: sturdy gun-wielding dwarf Karl, well-rounded swordsman Galandra, acrobatic rogue Cider and ranged frog wizard Brome — yes, <em>frog wizard</em>.</p>
<p>If you want a closer look after checking out the above trailer, here's a handful of screens from Dotemu:</p>

<p>It looks like a blast, and if our brief hands-on time was anything to go by, it will be — assuming it scrubs up nicely on Switch. Every game under the sun seems to be coming our way in October, but this one might just be worth making some room for.</p>

						<h5>Dying Light: The Beast</h5><p><span>September 18, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>When I was jumping into Techland's Dying Light: The Beast, it wasn't for the third time since the first title's release in 2015. It was for my very first, and like an amateur parkourer trying to jump across one roof to another for the first time, I was cautiously enthusiastic. Aware that this could go horribly wrong, or be an amazing thrill.</p>



<p>Thankfully, after fearing I would suffer the former in my early hours, my time with it leaned closer to the latter thanks to its survival elements and the two tried-and-true pillars of the series. I began to understand why one of my best friends has put in hundreds of hours between the first two games.</p>



<p>Of course, I had heard a lot about the first two games, so I knew the basics. There are zombies, a first-person parkour system, and a focus on melee combat. I didn't know who Kyle Crane was, but thankfully, the game is prepared for me and other such players since there's a quick recap video ready to give you Cole's (Kyle's) notes on Crane's last outing.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast sees Kyle Crane return after a decade of imprisonment. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is all to say that everything about Dying Light was new to me, and what is now old hat for veterans of the series had a stronger impact on me because it was new. Like, how the parkour feels absolutely wild. Keeping to the rooftops was always a fun challenge that I enjoyed solving on the fly as a longtime fan of platformers. Finding a flow within it all and running across ledges or high wires to leap through half-open windows felt exhilarating. And all the more disappointing when a wrong step sent me to the ground.</p>



<p>But while I could see how its movement and combat could keep you locked in for hours, the whole package of The Beast lost me before I hit credits, thanks to some poor design choices and some flaws that brought the experience down from the start.</p>



<p>Overall, I found that Dying Light: The Beast is a land of contrasts, with equal parts I could do without and elements I loved as a newcomer to the series. It's a completely fine videogame; an enjoyable time, surely, for someone invested in Crane's story arc more than a newcomer like me could be, and anyone who appreciates crunchy and satisfying zombie kills.</p>

<p>Before I dig deeper, a few bits of needed context. Dying Light: The Beast brings the first game's protagonist, Kyle Crane, back into the spotlight after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a>'s Aiden Caldwell took center stage. Crane's story kicks back up in a research facility where he's been tested on and tortured for years. After being the personal lab rat to a man we know as 'The Baron' for a decade, when Crane gets his opportunity to escape, he succeeds and vows to take revenge.</p>



<p>You begin to meet a cast of characters along that journey, like Olivia, a mysterious woman who helps you escape in the first place and get stronger to take on The Baron. Jacob, the Sheriff, and the people of the Town Hall, who give you a place to rest your head while you help them stay alive, and help you in your fight against The Baron. Of course, getting revenge on the Baron and helping your new friends survive isn't as simple as it sounds at the beginning of the game, and the story unfolds in a fairly straightforward manner.</p>

</figure>



<p>I won't go any further into details to avoid spoilers, but what I'll say is that I don't think anyone will play Dying Light: The Beast for its story. I found it to be fairly bland and overall uninteresting, especially because the performance from Roger Craig Smith (Kyle Crane) jumped from contextually tone-deaf open-world quest speak to some emotionally charged and impactful moments, with Smith wonderfully portraying the anger Crane carries with him, and how his never-ending crusade to help people in impossible situations can lead to moments where Crane is reminded of the good that people are capable of. Nothing felt consistent, making it all the more difficult for me to get invested in the story.</p>



<p>And those better moments often came from side quests instead of the main campaign, which is a scenario that's always disappointed me in games. I've never subscribed to the notion that good side quests make up for a lacking core campaign. I think it's just another way of saying 'Don't worry, the game gets way better once you're 10 hours in,' since I might have to spend that kind of time getting to the side quests that are supposed to make the other bad parts worth it.</p>



<p>There are some undeniably cool and tense gameplay moments I won't spoil here, included in the missions you'll complete for the main campaign. It also has two boss fights out of the several you encounter that stand out as trying to do something more engaging with its combat, but the primary campaign never evolved beyond being a vehicle through which new characters and more interesting side quests are introduced.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Most of the infected you fight in boss encounters end up becoming an infected variant you can find while running around the game's map, and are also repeated in later boss fights.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With regards to the gameplay, as I said before, the parkour mechanics can feel exhilarating with how fluidly you can move from rooftop to rooftop, particularly when you get a grapple hook in the back half of the game. But there's a fairly major bone I have to pick with how you get around in Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>A large chunk of the map is an area called Old Town, with tall buildings and rooftops galore to parkour through. There are other smaller town-like areas around it, but Old Town is where the game's parkour mechanics shine best. The rest of the map? A giant park with trees and bushes that you'll either run on your own two feet through or drive through to go from one objective to another. I thought I was playing a parkour open-world game, not a game where getting across the map in a reasonable amount of time means scavenging for fuel and going out of my way to find the closest working truck.</p>



<p>Every moment I spent driving instead of parkouring felt antithetical to what I thought was a key part of Dying Light's pitch. Could you imagine Insomniac making players drive around New York as Spider-Man as a significant part of how you're supposed to get around, instead of his usual web swinging? That's how against the grain it felt to get into a car in this game. I can understand it as an added layer to the survival and resource management woven into the gameplay, or even just as Techland wanting to try something new (although it was already a part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Following expansion</a>). It just doesn't work to the game's benefit.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics are really fun to play around with. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>The driving doesn't even feel good.</figcaption></figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Thankfully, Dying Light: The Beast's other core gameplay pillar, melee combat, doesn't have the same kind of problem. It's just good; the weapons are fun to use, the modifiers you can craft for them add some decent effects, particularly for critical hits, and entering Kyle's new 'Beast Mode' never lost its touch due to how perfectly Techland nailed it with attack and finishing animations that really make you feel like you could tear through anything.</p>



<p>On the flip side of tearing through enemies, I deeply enjoyed how tense I got if I was caught out at night. The threat of Volatiles around each corner and 'the chase' to get back to a safe zone had my heart pounding nearly every time, and trying to navigate while sneaking around to avoid a chase felt like one of the most intense cat-and-mouse games within a videogame I've ever played, as I did what I could to find my way in the dark, only turning my flashlight on for a few brief seconds to try and figure out my path forward without ringing a Volatiles' dinner bell.</p>



<p>I also happen to like weapon durability, and I appreciated that there were enough strong weapons to be found, crafted, and repaired that I didn't have to be precious with what I used. I enjoyed switching between different weapon classes to see what I preferred, and how a weapon's unique shape impacted my infected/human slicing skills, and making the necessary resource choices to either keep a weapon I'm having fun with going or move on to something else.</p>

<figure><figcaption>This isn't the best Chimera boss fight, but it's one of the better ones. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>What I could have done without is the color-coded system and slow upgrade pacing for everything, particularly the gear Crane wears. When upgrading your weapon's blueprints, you'll almost always see meaningful improvements in damage output, and what Crane is wearing hardly felt like it was impacting gameplay at all.</p>



<p>Levelling up, obviously, has a greater impact on your health, stamina, etc, than any piece of gear could. XP is, however, dolled out slowly, and the four sections of a skill tree you work your way through just feel like they are there because skill trees are a staple of the genre. The abilities on the trees feel empty, like they're included in the game because it's what's expected.</p>



<p>I don't mind a good skill tree, but when you're dedicating a late-game ability slot to just being able to craft a grenade launcher, that can't help but feel like a lack of creativity. I'd already found blueprints to craft items in the overworld, so why couldn't I have found grenade launcher blueprints? I understand it as a way to determine the flow of the challenge in a game so that players are not running around with an overpowered weapon from the get-go. But if pacing out the power fantasy of the endgame and managing the difficulty scale are the goals, then I think it would be far more engrossing to see that done through melee encounters and the abilities you can unlock to empower those encounters.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while Castor Woods almost always looks like a scene from a postcard, Techland's style of zombies, or infected, or whatever you'd like to call them, is genuinely freaky in a way I really appreciated. They're bloody, gory, and fall apart to my knife with a satisfying, blood-splattering slash. Whenever I saw another head roll, it just made me think of my favorite slasher films, and made me want to keep playing to chop off another zombie's head.</p>



<p>Lastly, a note on the game's performance. I did hit a few frame rate drops here and there, playing on my laptop with an NVIDIA 3070Ti and an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS on medium settings, but it didn't happen with any consistency that it broke my experience. What actually broke my experience was a progression-blocking bug I encountered early on in the game, though that was before a day-one patch was issued ahead of release, so hopefully it is fixed and you'll be spared having to rollback your save like I did to get around it. All I ask of my games is that they look good and run smoothly, and for the majority of my 35+ hours it took to hit credits, that was how The Beast ran.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has two core pillars that are fairly strong, and if you are already a fan of the series, then there's sure to be plenty here for you to enjoy, even if it might not knock it out of the park in every element. If you're new to the series and have no prior attachments to it, but love a good zombie-killing game now and then, I'd push you to really consider how much you want to spend your money on this game, when there are so many better games to spend your time with in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Overall, those two pillars only keep the game interesting for as long as you want to keep your brain turned off. A dash of well-executed survival elements around those pillars doesn't make up for the rest of the ways the game is lacking, making Dying Light: The Beast a missable title as we move into the final months of 2025 with plenty of major releases on the horizon.</p>

					<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements. Beyond that, the mechanical and narrative pacing, inconsistent writing and narrative tone, and world design choices that feel antithetical to the series in the first place all bring it to a fairly uninteresting experience that is only worth it for however long you want to turn your brain off and enjoy watching digital infected brains go *splat.*</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Castor Woods is a gorgeous setting
</li><li>Combat is fun and satisfying to pull off, and Beast Mode feels especially fun to engage

            <title><![CDATA[Epic Will Let Fortnite Developers Sell In-Game Items Starting in December]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-will-let-fortnite-developers-sell-in-game-items-december/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic announced today that beginning this December, developers making their own games in Fortnite will be able to sell in-game items directly from their items as a new line of potential revenue on top of the revenue already received from engagement payouts.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items">blog post</a> on the official Fortnite website, where Epic explained that as part of this new feature's implementation, developers will earn 100% of the value from sales in their islands from December 2025 through to the end of 2026. After that, the normal rate earned will be 50%.</p>



<p>Payouts from engagement are also being updated, with an update coming on November 1, 2025, to include changes like "<em>Creators that bring in new or lapsed players will receive 75% of those players' contributions to the engagement payout pool for their first six months</em>."</p>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Epic will also add a sponsored row to its Discover page. "<em>All creators will have transparent market data to bid for placement in the row and enter an auction to surface islands in the new Sponsored Row,</em>" Epic writes. The revenue split will also follow the same timeline as the sale of in-game items, with developers receiving 100% from revenue generated by being in the sponsored row from November 2025 through to the end of 2026, with it dropping to 50% afterwards.</p>



<p>Creator Communities are another new feature that Epic is launching in the next few months, letting developers "<em>build community forums with island updates, event information, feedback requests, and more</em>. <em>Creator posts will also appear to players in Fortnite across Island Lobbies, Island Pages, Creator Pages, and a new row in Discover</em>."</p>



<p>It's the latest step in Epic continuing to compete with <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">Roblox</a>, which comes across particularly with how Epic shares the difference between what can be earned on Roblox as a creator there versus developing games for Fortnite.</p>



<p>Whether this will actually generate more revenue for Fortnite developers is another question, since players will still have to want to buy these items in the first place.</p>



<p>"<em>Since UEFN launched, players have spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands, which has resulted in $722,000,000 paid out to date. We'll continue investing in new tools that unlock more development possibilities for creators</em>."</p>

            <p>Something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>-related has happened <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">at an Australian museum again</a>. This time, rather than the game being confirmed for an appearance back when it was still infinitely mysterious and sans release date, it's Team Cherry devs addressing just how difficult their creation is, following plenty of post-release discourse on the subject.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">first patch making a couple of its early bosses a bit easier</a> to tackle, amid debate as to whether it's just good and hard, or pushes into unnecessarily annoying slog territory via the likes of bench placement and hazards being able to deal out two masks of damage. As with every FromSoft game since time itself began with the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demons-souls">Demon's Souls</a>, where you stand on that bickering will likely depend on how prepared you are to spend hours battling one foe over and over again.</p>

<p>Naturally, the appropriate venue for Team Cherry co-directors Ari Gibson and William Pellen to weigh in on this conundrum of our time is Australia’s national museum of screen culture, <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">ACMI</a>, where the launch of a new exhibition was attended and reported on by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>.</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson said when asked about the difficulty by exhibition co-curator Jini Maxwell. "So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes."</p><p>While acknowledging that Skong packs "some moments of steep difficulty", Gibson stuck to emphasising that going for a wander is the best medicine if you get stuck banging your head against a bug-shaped wall, as there are "ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely". Learning? In a video game? Come on lads, I can't be doing that. I use my brain for marginally more important things during the average day, but by the time I get to playing games for non-work purposes, it's all just mush up there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress. Gibson and Pellen also explained the differences between developing Silksong and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> from a hardness perspective. Hornet, with her superior zippiness and superior skills to the knight, demanded more complicated base enemies to make sure she still faced a good challenge.</p>
<p>"The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss," Pellen said. "The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away."</p>
<p>I imagine this was followed up with a gesture to some screens of culture as the devs indicated that the time had come to check out the Aussie exhibitions. If you're still struggling with Silksong, definitely check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">our great Silksong walkthrough</a> Ollie's worked very hard on.

            <p>Parkoury zombie bludgeoner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has, literally just this minute, gone on sale, which means the review embargo curtain has lifted on RPS to reveal... an empty chair with an IOU stuck to it.</p>
<p>This one is my bad, rather than because of any cheeky <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">code</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-is-out-now-but-our-review-code-just-arrived-so-im-writing-about-this-silly-bicycle-game-instead">withholding</a>. I’d simply underestimated how many trillions of PC games were also out this week, and had to abandon my charge through The Beast to help keep the undermanned Treehouse on top of things elsewhere. Still, we’ll shortly be bringing you a full, likely much better appraisal from RPS veteran Dominic Tarason (thaaaaaanks Dominic), and in penance, I offer some initial impressions from my couple of hours with the game’s opening.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-wants-to-make-you-afraid-of-the-dark-again">Techland weren’t kidding about the nighttime</a>. In response to complaints that the nocturnally inclined zombs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a> weren’t sufficiently scary after the sun goes down, The Beast looks to put more horror back in the darkness. Successfully, in the mind of this wimp. Between the night’s pitch blackness, the keyring LED you call a torch, and the sprinting, lethally hench super-zeds that aren’t at all keen on sharing the game’s rooftops, any sort of freerunning you were flexing with during the daylight hours is effectively reduced to nervous shimmying through the void.</p>
<p>Yet it still feels like you’re <em>supposed</em> to be chased back to the safehouse by these burly Volatile bois now and then, in which case panic and near-blindness become enemies in themselves. Several attempts to survive my first night ended with my shinbones shooting up into my lungs, the stress of a pursuit having overwhelmed my ability to consider whether a roof-to-roof jump was actually doable before I hurled myself into the cobbles below. It’s not always "fun", strictly speaking. But it is decent horror.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>If anything, The Beast’s brighter hours could do with more of this urgency. The bread-and-butter meleeing benefits from some nicely heavy hittin' sticks, but the actual swinging sensation is on the wrong side of sluggish, at least in these early stages. The first two bosses aren't that exhilarating either: they require little in the way of sharp timing or last-gasp dodging, outside of a few repeating, heavily telegraphed attacks.</p><p>Visually and practically, they’re also just minor variations on the same 'What if a ghoul was taller and shredded' concept, which somewhat saps the excitement out of your stated mission of hunting and killing as many of these souped- up zeds as possible. Fleeting thrills can be had in the moments when you transform into a berzerking monsterman yourself, ripping off limbs and punching through chest cavities, but the time limit on this literal beast mode seems disappointingly stingy, considering how many regular shovel hits it takes to build up the gauge.</p>
<p>Again, mind, I’d only got two hours into what is supposedly a 20-hour-plus campaign. And I was similarly insta-fatigued by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">apparently ain’t half bad</a> once it gets rolling. Maybe I really <em>should</em> stick to hardware, in which case, I’ll note that Dying Light: The Beast has also been granted Verified status for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – justifiably so, as it repeatedly breached 60fps on my Steam Deck OLED when running in Performance mode. There is the slight hitch of an Epic Game Store pop-up asking on launch if you want to sync accounts, but it doesn’t throw up any serious non-Steam-app compatibility woes, and can be banished with a tap of the B button on subsequent boots.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-horse-race">Patrick Recommends: Horse Race</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Horses, baby!</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my younger days, I liked hanging out at a bar for hours. Yeah, fine, part of the reason was to be irresponsible at an age when I could afford to, but it was a reason to sit around with a group of people for an extended period of time and <em>talk</em>. Even though my circle of friends are not board game people, I get the appeal. It's the same idea. It's a justification to be around people and pass the time.</p><p>In the past year or so, some friends introduced us to our new obsession: <em>Horse Race</em>. I've tried to find out the origins of this goofy and unpredictable dice game, but maybe your AI-garbled searches will produce better information than mine.</p><p>Here is the short pitch on <em>Horse Race</em>, though. </p><p>You have a board where a series of horses are moving forward on the board if you roll the number that matches the horse. The more unlikely the number combination, the fewer spots the horse has to move. Four of the horses each round are "scratched," determined by one person rolling four times. From there, you move around the table and have each person keep rolling until a horse crosses the finish line. Each time you roll a scratched horse, you have to pay into the pot. What you pay escalates based on the order in which it was scratched, i.e. a horse in the "four" spot means you have other pay up 4X.</p><p>(<a href="https://fgbradleys.com/wp-content/uploads/rules/Horse%20Race%20Game.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOorW5Z2PleP_2_lQte0U9PFHmS4iR3vW_yS8aUll9darWq1f9EGu&amp;ref=remapradio.com">The full rules are here</a>, but like many games of this type, you're like to and are encouraged to have house rules.) </p><p>It's completely random. There is no skill. It's also so goddamn fun. We've had nights stretch into the collective bedtime for the children of parents involved because, well, maybe if we just did one more round...? I lost all of my money last time around, and would happily head back into the horse breach to try and claw it all back.</p><p>(Usually, we play with nickels and dimes. Last time, we escalated to quarters.)</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-vintage-asmr">Rob Recommends: Vintage ASMR</h3><figure><figcaption><span>"ASMR Working to decipher a message on a captured Enigma, this 1940's scientist has a breakthrough!" is a very unique YouTube title. Credit: Jake Hellbach</span></figcaption></figure><p>I am just going to share an awesome thing that Carolyn Petit was posting about the other night: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JakeHellbach/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=1&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">The Jake Hellbach Vintage ASMR</a> Youtube channel. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carolynmichelle.bsky.social/post/3lu4ajqpmos2y?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Carolyn described his work</a> as being "staged and shot with care, and the vibe i often get from them is something like "could have been footage of a character in a '90s FMV game doing their thing."</p><p>Admittedly, I can be shaky on what is ASMR and what is not. I'd call his longer videos ambient or mood pieces, but the important thing is that in a landscape littered with lousy hacked-together scene renders, this guy is making unique short films with good photography and <em>excellent </em>prop design and selection. In fact, looking at his channel, it seems like he's a prop master as much as a photographer. </p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkqijUiEf8&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">an early video of his</a> is just five minutes of footage of a train compartment set where a man is writing something on a manual typewriter and jotting down notes. But off to his right, my eyes immediately locked onto an old pre-war Lucky Strike package, when the orange disc had become part of the brand design but before they moved to the white wrapper.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The advantages of a laptop goes without saying, but lets say it anyway. It’s portable. It’s a portable computer you can take anywhere with you. But I’m here to tell you, “Big whoop.” a lot of us end up just doing our work from the same spot anyway and if you don’t need that portability, you can save some cash by just going with a tower instead. <strong>Take a look at Dell’s Vostro 3030 PC tower.</strong> This is the kind of computer that does what’s expected of it and nothing more. A capital P, capital C <em>PC</em>.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/"> It normally goes for $899, but Amazon happens to have it right now for 33% off. Right now, you’ll save $299, bringing the price down to just $600 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>Diving into the specs, what we have here is a 13-inch by 6-inch by 12inch PC tower powered by a 14th generation Intel Core i3-14100 processor and an integrated Intel UHD 730 graphics card. It’s loaded with 32GB of RAM which while make your performance-intensive apps run fast and react snappy. As far as storage is concerned, the Dell Vostro 3030 is equipped with a PCIe SSD with a capacity of 1TB. You can expect fast load times from anything off this solid state drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compatibility Options</h2>
<p>One big bonus PC towers have over laptops—the ports. With a newer laptop you might have to suffice with just one, maybe two USB slots along the side. That’s not the case here. This Dell tower comes with three USB-A ports and one USB-C, and that’s just on the front. Turn it around and you’ll be greeted with four more USB Type-A ports. That makes eight USB ports in total.</p>



<p>Other connections you’ll find are an HDMI and DisplayPort so you can set yourself up with two monitors side by side. You also have an Ethernet port on the back and a combination headphone/microphone audio jack conveniently on the front. The Dell tower supports Bluetooth so you can pair wirelessly to headphones or other accessories like your mouse or gaming controller. Wi-Fi 6 support enables you to take advantage of fast download and upload speeds.</p>
<p>The Dell PC tower comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. That comes with support for OneDrive and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/">For a limited time, Dell’s Vostro 3030 PC tower is heavily discounted at Amazon. Get it right now for $299 off.</a> That brings the price all the way down from $899 to just $600.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4162/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
