            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-puts-entire-game-division-on-hiatus-undisclosed-number-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Surgent Studios, the creators of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, have reportedly put their entire game division on hiatus after announcing the choice to do this in a<a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1847194285545848933" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> statement on X</a>. They have asked for help to find collaborative partners, as they haven't yet secured funding for their next project. As a result, they've put the team on notice for redundancy. It doesn't specify whether that is the entire team or just part of it, but this isn't the first layoff experience for Surgent Studios, either. Shortly after Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was released, Surgent Studios laid off "just over a dozen people" in June, which was three months after the release of Tales of Kenzera: ZAU.</p>
<p>Surgent Studios first appeared on the map in 2020 after announcing themselves as Silver Rain Studios before eventually re-branding. The company was founded by Assassin's Creed Origins and House of the Dragon actor Abubukar Salim. The company not only dabbles in games but has also worked in movies and TV shows, with a focus on bringing "a pioneering philosophy to storytelling across film, television, games, and emerging platforms." Whether this announcement means that the other branches of the company will also be affected remains to be seen. The careers page from the official Surgent Studios website has been removed, which isn't a fantastic sign of what's to come for the company.</p>
<p>While the game was well received by critics and the general audience who played it, it didn't perform well commercially. As a result, Surgent Studios is unable to fund its next projects, as it didn't particularly profit from the release of Tales of Kenzera: ZAU. Now, the team at Surgent Studios is working on a new prototype, which it claims is "darker, edgier, and more visceral" than the previous title. However, the prototype is said to still retain all "ZAU's high-octane combat and cultural depth." While they are working on the new prototype, they are said to still be releasing some upcoming content and updates for ZAU.</p>
<p>In the comments, plenty of people are being supportive of the company, and are tagging studios that have the potential to collaborate with Surgent Studios. Some are also suggesting for them to create a Kickstarter or GoFundMe, as this is something that has been successful for many indie games in the past, especially games such as the "My Time At" series.</p>

The new patch added a difficulty option that some players feel is too frustrating while tweaking other parts of the game to make co-op missions harder, resulting in backlash from the community. Now, the devs are promising more changes as players complain that the game isn’t as fun as before. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195618,195752" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029"><em>Space Marine 2</em> launched last month</a></span> to rave reviews from critics and players. The sci-fi third-person shooter quickly became one of 2024's biggest games, and it’s only set to grow more as developer Saber Interactive has promised future updates that will add new features, cosmetic options, modes, missions, weapons, and more. However, players are worried about the future of <em>Space Marine 2</em> as its most recent patch has nerfed co-op weapons and items, making it harder than ever to finish missions. </p><p>On October 17, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?l=english&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s 4.0 patch arrived on all platforms</a></span>. It added a new co-op mission featuring a big new alien monster to kill, but it also made changes that players aren’t happy about. These include limiting how often you can collect ammo from crates, making it harder to parry enemy attacks with certain melee weapons, substantially nerfing a powerful weapon used against bosses in Operations, and lowering armor effectiveness on the Ruthless difficulty setting. </p><p>Ruthless was previously the highest difficulty setting in the game. However, 4.0 added a new Lethal difficulty setting intended to be the hardest option. But some players think it might be too impossibly hard. One reason is a new trait found in this difficulty option that requires you to stick close to your co-op buddies to regain armor. This is hard enough with a coordinated team, but is damn near impossible with randoms. And it also forces all classes to stick together and makes it harder to be a sniper or a tank. </p><h2 id="h168"><a id=""></a>Players and devs react to the 4.0 update</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-up-in-arms-over-bullst-nerfs-have-you-learnt-nothing-from-helldivers-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-up-in-arms-over-bullst-nerfs-have-you-learnt-nothing-from-helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The community is not happy about these changes</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61qmm/this_game_brought_me_into_the_golden_era_of/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61qmm/this_game_brought_me_into_the_golden_era_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Reddit</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61lkx/yeah_this_is_no_fun_anymore/?share_id=8mbk2WeKa1nrN4VdX9Bk9&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61lkx/yeah_this_is_no_fun_anymore/?share_id=8mbk2WeKa1nrN4VdX9Bk9&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players have posted</a></span> about how the Operations mode now feels annoying to play, even on lower difficulties, due to these changes.

On October 18, Saber Interactive and publisher Focus posted a message on Twitter confirming that they were aware of all the backlash and had plans to release another patch with new balance changes “next week.” </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We closely read your feedback regarding the latest patch for <em>Space Marine 2 </em>and we’re actively working on another one including balancing fixes. It should release next week.  Again, thank you for your support.</p></blockquote><p>For now, that seems to have cooled the community off as players wait to see what Saber’s next patch tweaks in <em>Space Marine 2</em>. </p><p>And to be fair to the developer, the patch notes for this new update did indicate that the devs found Operations “too easy” and these changes were intended to fix that. But they also included a message stating that they wouldn’t know how much more difficult they had made co-op until the update was live and in players’ hands, adding: “We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change.” Well, they were right about that last part. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ricochet was active during the Black Ops 6 beta, and Activision says cheaters were able to complete around 10 multiplayer matches during weekend one before being removed.</p><p dir="ltr">"After tweaking our systems and deploying new detection methods for weekend two, we cut that time in half to five matches. That timing achieved our Time to Action goal. In fact, 25% of all weekend-two bans happened during the first match a cheater ever played," the publisher says.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Black Ops 6 will launch with the following upgraded protections:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">An updated version of the kernel-level driver</li><li dir="ltr">All mitigations, including Damage Shield, Disarm, Splat, Hallucination, and others will be live</li><li dir="ltr">New machine-learning behavioral systems, focused on speed of detection</li><li dir="ltr">New machine-learning detection models to analyze gameplay to combat aim bots</li><li dir="ltr">Upgrades when Ranked Play launches, which include continuous examinations to determine if leaderboard placements are accurate</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Activision revealed that new Warzone-specific anti-cheat features are also active, and players can expect a future blog post to discuss those methods.</p><p dir="ltr">For future advancements to Call of Duty's anti-cheat, Activision says the Ricochet team has been working on a suite of tools that uses AI to find and fight cheaters. The publisher says it already has data from cheaters, but now it's using data from the pro players in the Call of Duty League to learn more on the behavioral side.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cheat developers can't hide player behavior," the publisher says. "How people play -- the legit, the phony, the good, and the bad -- gives us information and we use that to build ways to pick those bad folks out of a lineup."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also reminds players that anti-cheat is a constant effort. "We are always working to stop and thwart the efforts of cheaters. It's an effort we're deeply committed to, through and through."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this new report on Ricochet comes just a day after Activision confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-anti-cheat-was-falsely-banning-legitimate-players-but-all-accounts-have-been-restored/1100-6527252/">players found a workaround in a Ricochet detection system</a> that allowed them to target legitimate players in Warzone and Modern Warfare 3, resulting in false bans that have since been reversed.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-lightless-world-wants-to-redefine-the-action-roguelike-genre/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Lightless World, the upcoming action roguelike game from The3rd.One Games, aims to redefine what players expect from the roguelike and survivor genre.</p>



<p>With a focus on dynamic progression, skill customization, and cooperative gameplay, it offers a fresh twist on the fast-paced, wave-based combat popularized by titles like Vampire Survivors and Soulstone Survivors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It comes as a passion project from the team at The3rd.One Games and its founder and CEO Yannis Ziakas. Ziakas is also the CEO and founder of Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>“We wanted to create something that looked better, played better,” Ziakas said. “We were sick of being in Discord and sharing our screens. We wanted to play together.”</p>



<p>Rather than settling for familiar mechanics, The Lightless World builds on the genre with a procedurally generated talent system. Every run presents players with a unique skill tree and nodes hidden beneath a fog-of-war, filled with rare abilities and stat boosts waiting to be discovered. This ensures that each session offers new challenges and character builds, encouraging experimentation and making every playthrough feel distinct.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“It’s a mini game down to exploring the fog of war in your talent tree, reconnecting the nodes, the chance of nodes spawning as rare or epic nodes, and so on and so forth,” Ziakas said.</p>



<p>The game will feature 12 playable archdemons when it fully launches with the goal of making sure that no two runs feel the same.</p>



<p>“You could play as a Barbarian – Ker’beroth – and play 300 hours, and none of your runs will be identical,” Ziakas added.</p>



<p>It’s not just a single-player experience, either. Unlike most roguelikes that focus on solo play, The Lightless World introduces multiplayer, letting two players sync up for intense, coordinated runs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ziakas believes there’s a simple reason that nobody, so far, had made a game like this multiplayer yet because, as he put it, it’s “pretty hard”. Making a game like this multiplayer took quite a bit of research and development to make sure everything from collisions to spells being in sync to hit markets and more were all done the right way. With things like the spell synchronization and combat, the game creates a dynamic experience that scales with teamwork, enhancing both the strategy and fun.</p>



<p>Thematically, the game flips the typical hero narrative by casting players as archdemons defending their realms against invading forces of good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“It’s reverse horror,” Ziakas said.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As players control archdemons, they must gather souls to reclaim their lost immortality while fending off waves of knights, archangels, and warriors. This narrative twist breathes new life into the genre, framing the endless waves of enemies with a compelling backstory that sets the stage for future updates and expansions.</p>



<p>The game’s visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 5, aim to elevate the genre with semi-photorealistic environments inspired by Doom and Diablo. Despite its graphical ambition, The Lightless World is optimized to run well on a variety of platforms, including the Steam Deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Some of us have Steam Deck and run it without any optimization,” Ziakas said while also hinting at the potential for future mobile and console ports.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With simple but effective controls – WASD for movement, space for dodging, and R for Ultimates– the game remains accessible to a wide audience. Players will even soon be able to activate auto-targeting for more casual play as well as to be more accessible for players.</p>



<p>While the original plan was to release shortly after Steam Next Fest, where there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406480/The_Lightless_World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently a demo available</a>, The3rd.One Games is targeting a February or March 2025 Early Access release. This time window, Ziakas says, allows the game a better chance of standing out in what can be a crowded genre. Whenever the official release happens, however, he’s certain that what the team has built will provide players with a consistently fun experience.</p>



<p>“It has a lot of depth and difficulty and complexity in gameplay without losing its identity as a roguelike game,” he said.</p>

"If we like the opportunity, we'll take it." Bloober Team released the Silent Hill 2 remake on October 8 to glowing critical reception <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week">and strong sales too</a>, leaving many fans of the previously dormant horror franchise eager for more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do believe that everything's possible.</p></div><p>"There are opportunities that you have to seize," Piejko added. "Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible."</p><p>The decision will also be in the hands of Silent Hill publisher Konami, though it is presumably happy with how the Silent Hill 2 remake turned out. Nothing has been announced regarding another remake or full sequel yet, however.</p><p>Bloober Team has already announced one of its new projects in the aforementioned Cronos: The New Dawn. Coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam, the game is set in a post apocalyptic 1980s Poland and promises a "twisted time travel story" in Bloober Team's first foray into an original survival horror franchise.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">In our 8/10 review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, IGN said: "Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>The MW3 campaign was the worst-received Call of Duty campaign in recent memory. In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-review-return-of-the-makarov/1900-6418152/" data-ref-id="1900-6418152">GameSpot review</a>, S.E.

However, the campaign's reception allegedly did not affect Black Ops 6's development. In conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-dev-raven-didnt-react-to-modern-warfare-3-campaigns-terrible-reception-we-were-already-pretty-locked-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, associate creative director at Raven Software John Zuk said, "...we were already pretty locked in on the story we were telling and the missions we were creating."</p><p>Reportedly, MW3 was originally envisioned as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-was-developed-on-a-very-rushed-schedule-report/1100-6519074/" data-ref-id="1100-6519074">an expansion for Modern Warfare 2</a>. When it was upgraded to a full release, developers reportedly crunched to develop a new campaign in just a year and half (Call of Duty usually has a three-year development cycle). In contrast, Black Ops 6 has been in development for four years. According to Zuk, "The extra development time certainly gives us time to do a little bit more prototyping and a little bit more trying something out, finding out if it's fun and if it works and throwing some things away."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/10-10-games-head-of-publishing-says-uk-has-become-hostile-to-new-game-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843310/Funko_Fusion/">Funko Fusion</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer 1010 Games was brought to life in 2021 by a number of TT Games veterans, who'd all worked on various LEGO games at the Warner Bros.-owned studio. They were experienced with the family-friendly 3D action genre, and wanted to make an "older" version with Funko pops taking over for the beloved branded bricks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What they found, head of publishing Arthur Parsons explained to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, was that starting up a brand new studio in the United Kingdom was incredibly difficult. So difficult in fact, that he's worried the country as a whole is losing out on fresh talent and opportunities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's not enough support," he explained. "When you look across the UK industry, it's no surprise that there's not more studios starting up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parsons' bluntness was refreshing—he seemed as eager to ring the bell about the UK's funding troubles as he was to show off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Funko Fusion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which admittedly caught my eye because of how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/horror/456218/funko-fusion-review-impressions">surprisingly nightmare fuel-inducing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it was).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's to be done about the UK industry's struggles? Parsons explained it's not just what the government can do, but also what needs to be done in the investment community if they want to keep revenue flowing into the British isles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Little funding and less assistance">Little funding and less assistance</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parson's description of the beleaguered UK funding scene sounded like a confluence of small catastrophes, some borne out by the economic impact of Brexit, and others by shrinking interest in game companies in training the next generation of developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1010 Games is privately funded, so Parsons said they dodged a number of initial challenges that come with standing up a studio. "It would be great if there were more grants, more incentives to do stuff," he said. "We've had to do a lot of stuff off our own back, off our own money."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lack of funding and incentives, he worries, is disincentivizing companies from hiring and training junior developers. Over half of 1010 Games employees were hired fresh out of university—a fact Parsons is proud of, but he's frustrated they're one of the few companies reportedly doing so. He said "one of the biggest problems the game industry is facing is a shortage of talent because people aren't hiring juniors."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We as an industry are not being sustainable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like other developers trying to make game studios and not VC-friendly exit vehicles, Parsons said the team ran into headwinds chasing funding because investors weren't interested in an old-fashioned company that turns out premium product. Funders wanted to hear the words "web3," "AR," or "VR" whenever they took a pitch. ("We weren't cool enough," he joked.)</span></p><p>Image via 1010 Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers in the UK have also been hit hard by a Catch-22 that's impacting up-and-coming indies everywhere: the cost of the "first-playable." Investors are (perhaps rightly) not satisfied anymore by prototypes and pitch decks, and want to see vertical slices and first-playable that capture the general feel of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Funko Fusion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game inspired by the TT Games</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Lego series and produced by its veterans, it took a solid chunk of time to answer</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a reasonable request...but both of those products cost money. Money that can only be secured with decent funding. He agreed with a sentiment expressed by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">the developers at Mobius Digital</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that investors and publishers need to become more comfortable "funding failure."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The British government does offer game developers some incentives in the form of tax relief, but that tends to benefit existing studios. New companies have to deal with challenges like legal fees or securing office space and equipment. "I can imagine that for other people, there's they're just hitting a brick wall, and that's maybe why nothing sort of happens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Increasing government funding for games or the arts might be a tough sell in the UK at this moment. A number of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66937239">structural challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are keeping down the country's economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and challenges like an underfunded National Institute of Health require faster intervention than flagging video game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parsons said he'd like to see the country introduce students earlier to the basics of game development, noting that the UK has great universities, but that careers in the creative arts aren't pitched the same way in primary schools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He hopes one day students can be encouraged to pursue careers in game development with the same gusto as they are engineering or medicine.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Help me get my feet back on the ground">Help me get my feet back on the ground</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges Parsons described are the same ones developers are enduring across the globe, but calling out what struggles the United Kingdom is facing is still important, as it will need unique solutions to weather the storm. A </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/the-impact-of-brexit-on-uk-firms">Bank of England report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from early 2024 shows the country is still struggling to attract new investment years after exiting the European Union, meaning developers are chasing some of the same funds for the last few years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The British Film Institute </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-indies-to-receive-510000-in-lottery-funding">did announce today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that it's awarding £510,000 to four projects meant to support developers across the nation, but it's a drop in the bucket for what will be needed in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what's to be done in the country that gave us the ZX Spectrum, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sea of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alien Isolation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Probably a lot. A shortage of juniors, more flexible investment strategies, and proper incentives could go a long way. But it's fair to say more will need to be done to help the nation compete in a business that's becoming more global by the day.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Fellow environment artist Julian Hofman, meanwhile, said the remaster has a “fresh generation of moss,” and I know you’re probably thinking, “Who cares?” but in terms of a game whose best moments are often found in just quietly walking around its hyper-realistic sci-fi landscapes, well, I do!</p><p>The prospect of more populated cities also sounds really neat. “We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfill their needs,” said senior technical game designer Brian van Nunen. “We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations. For example, there is now a woman feeding geese at the well in Meridian, reusing an existing sowing animation.” Yes...ha ha ha...yes!</p><p>That’s not to say I’m on board with all of the changes.

These remasters also have a tendency to wash out the colors and mood of the original in the process of trying to make them look even more  realistic. While the remaster looks very impressive in a lot of ways, some of the changes seem to to be the result of artists not knowing when it’s time to just leave their masterpiece alone. </p><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster </em>is out on PS5 and PC on October 31.

<p>"We're incredibly grateful for the overwhelming support and positivity the project has received," the Fallout: London team wrote. "Your feedback plays a crucial role in our ongoing efforts to troubleshoot and fix bugs, and we'll keep refining Fallout: London until it's polished to perfection."</p><p>To that end, Team Folon now is gearing up to release another patch for its London mod. The video with further details is expected to go live later this afternoon, at 6pm UK time, so stay tuned for more. You can find the video below.</p>
<p>Team Folon's Fallout: London mod was released earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">following a few unexpected delays</a>, for free on GOG. It quickly became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>It had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">a bit of a bumpy start</a>, but soon after its debut the team got to work fixing the "reported technical issues", while thanking everyone for their patience in the meantime.</p>

<p>As for the franchise more generally, Amazon's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV adaptation has gone from strength to strength. Following its critically acclaimed debut in April, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">show has since been watched by 100 million viewers worldwide</a>. To put this figure into more perspective, Fallout is the only other show on Amazon Prime to cross the 100 million viewer threshold, the other being Rings of Power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hot off the heels of Team Folon's London project, a group of modders have set about working on their own international mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-seen-fallout-london-heres-fallout-nuevo-mexico">Fallout: Nuevo México</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even though I’m not big on the look of Funko Pops sanding down every art style and character design into a uniform look, there are some cute details in all three figures. Shadowheart carries the Mysterious Artefact she stole from the Githyanki before the events of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and Karlach wields an axe and comes bundled with a little figure of her teddy bear Clive that you can find at camp if you recruit her. Astarion is where things get a little interesting, as the vampire can either wield a dagger or has a one-in-six chance of holding the Necromancy of Thay tome. It’s like a dice roll. It’s meta. Either way, he has red eyes instead of the usual black ones most Funko Pops have, which is a cute touch.</p><p>I make jokes, but Funko Pops are at least an affordable alternative to the expensive premium statues that are so often released as tie-ins to major games. I can be a hater, I’ve got a few of those beady-eyed little fuckers on my shelves at home. As I write this I can see Ryuji Sakamoto from <em>Persona 5</em> in all his chibi glory from my desk. I’m a mark first, a hater second. So if you’re interested in a cheap tchotchke of your <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> fave, click through to see more. Maybe if enough people buy these they’ll also make Gale and I’ll have to eat crow.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esl-faceit-contribute-22-million-counter-strike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ESL FACEIT has announced a massive contribution to the world’s premier Counter-Strike 2 circuit through 2025 and 2026. A press release confirmed that a whopping $22 million will be contributed to ‘multiple professional ESL CS2 tournaments’ spanning the two years, with an equal portion of $11 million supporting each competitive calendar.</p>



<p>It’s a stacked schedule that kicks off in January 2025 with IEM Katowice, one of the most renowned tournaments in the world of esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eager-investment">Eager Investment</h2>



<p>ESL FACEIT is one of the biggest and most valuable esports organisations in the world. The company’s origins can be traced back to 2000, and in 2022 a merger brought together the two components – ESL and FACEIT. This merger occurred during an acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s Savvy Games Group, which proved to be a roaring success.</p>



<p>In a recent press release disclosing the news about this multi-million-dollar contribution, ESL FACEIT’s Marc Winther said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The EPT for Counter-Strike 2 is the definition of EFG’s commitment to fostering a fruitful competitive environment and continually nourishing Counter-Strike’s heritage, as we’ve done since 2000</em>.</p>



<p><em>With a circuit that spans multiple continents and integrates diverse levels of competition, we are excited to further fuel opportunities for world-class teams and passionate fans alike.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a stunning year for Counter-Strike esports. In the summer, the most-watched IEM Cologne event in history took place with a peak viewer count of more than one million users. We saw the 100th IEM event held in Dallas in the spring, and across 2024, more than 140 million hours of Counter-Strike content were consumed.</p>



<p>CS2 also had a spotlight moment in Brazil as IEM Rio 2024 unfolded. Per a data-backed report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/iem-rio-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Esports Charts</a>, IEM Rio 2024 was a roaring success thanks to multi-streams and watch parties hosted by popular streamers.</p>



<p>The 2025 calendar is <strong>dense</strong>. Here’s what fans can look forward to next year in the Counter-Strike space:</p>



<ul>
<li>IEM Katowice (Jan – Feb)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S21 (Feb – Mar)</li>



<li>IEM Spring 2025 (Apr)</li>



<li>IEM Dallas 2025 (May)</li>



<li>IEM Cologne (Jul – Aug)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S22 (Sep – Oct)</li>



<li>IEM Chengdu 2025 (Nov)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a positive time to become a Counter-Strike 2 esports fan. What tournament are you most looking forward to? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-puts-team-on-notice-for-redundancy.1013460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has put its development team "on notice for redundancy" as it looks for funding for its next project, the studio has revealed.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1847194285545848933" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Surgent says that while everyone on its team "worked incredibly hard to create&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>", studio management has decided "to put the work of the Surgent games division on hiatus".</p>
<p>The developer says it's created a prototype for what it says is a "bold new project". Surgent describes its new game as "darker, edgier, and more visceral than [<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>]", although it still retains that game's "high-octane combat and cultural depth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-redundancy-notice-boss.jpg?itok=jtMVP3lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-redundancy-notice-boss.jpg?itok=K9J6Zb4Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>'s development team is currently on redundancy notice.</figcaption></figure><p>Surgent goes on to say that it's currently looking for a publishing partner for this project, a position that's becoming all too common among the indie sphere; recently,&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>developer Italic Pig revealed that it, too, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paleo-pines-future-uncertain">seeking a new production partner</a> for a potential&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>
<p>The developer also teases "a couple of exciting updates coming down the pipeline" for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, although it doesn't say what those updates are, so you'll have to wait and see to find out what's coming to the game in future.</p>
<p>When asked whether its next project takes place in the same world as&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, Surgent said it was "hoping to answer" that question "soon". Sounds like the answer will at the very least be a qualified yes.</p>

<p>Surgent's announcement comes at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">trying time</a> for the gaming industry as a whole, with many studios both big and small suffering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-strike-stjv-union">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs">cancellations</a>, or outright <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">closures</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Surgent will suffer the same fate remains to be seen, but given that&nbsp;<em>Zau&nbsp;</em>seems to have failed to make a major impact either <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16584/tales-of-kenzera-zau" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critically</a> or <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2316580/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commercially</a>, the studio seems to be in a bit of a tight spot.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/keywords-studios-acquires-halo-and-call-of-duty-studio-certain-affinity.1013457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keywords-studios-certain-affinity-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Certain Affinity, a studio that's helped out with co-development on major games like&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</em>, has been acquired by Keywords Studios.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keywords-acquires-halo-co-developer-certain-affinity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the acquisition, which is for an "undisclosed sum", will consist of an upfront cash purchase combined with an "earn-out component" that will be based on Certain Affinity's performance going forward.</p>
<p>This is a fairly standard way to do business when it comes to studio acquisitions, as is the fact that Certain Affinity will seemingly largely be left alone, with its management team and workforce of around 180 apparently remaining intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=LW64Bs6o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=G4cyKf7N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Certain Affinity has worked on projects like&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain Affinity CEO Max Hoberman says he's "thrilled to be able to provide stability and a supportive home" for Certain Affinity at what is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">"most difficult time in the market"</a>.</p>
<p>As GI.biz points out, Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.certainaffinity.com/message-from-max/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">laid off 25 of its workers</a> back in March, so hopefully, this Keywords acquisition means that more employees' jobs won't be at risk, at least for the meantime.</p>
<p>For his part, Keywords CEO Bertrand Bodson says his company has "enormous respect" for Certain Affinity, and that the new acquisition will complement Keywords' "existing skills", as well as "expanding [its] presence notably in the US and Canada".</p>
<p>If you feel like Certain Affinity's name is familiar to you, it's probably because you remember 343 Industries (which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-unreal-engine-5-new-games">now Halo Studios</a>) announcing in 2022 that Certain Affinity would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/certain-affinity-is-further-evolving-halo-infinite-with-343">joining&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>as a co-developer</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=nWbRGrJB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=6CYAElw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also recognize Certain Affinity's name from its work on<em>&nbsp;Halo Infinite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the latest in a string of acquisitions for Keywords. In recent years, the company has also acquired&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keywords-studios-to-aquire-age-of-empires-developer-forgotten-empires"><em>Age of Empires&nbsp;</em>developer Forgotten Empires</a>, former&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Hardsuit Labs, and porting outfit Wushu Studios.</p>
<p>Whether Keywords' acquisition of Certain Affinity changes anything about the studio's development process remains to be seen, although given that Keywords isn't making any personnel changes, more drastic shakeups are unlikely.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launches on October 25, and if you're wondering if the shooter offers cross-play and cross-progression support, you're in luck: <strong>Black Ops 6 supports cross-play and cross-progression</strong>.</p><p>This post explains everything you need to know about Black Ops 6 cross-play and cross-progression ahead of launch, along with details on how to turn cross-play off and how to change your Activision ID.</p><h2><strong>How does cross-play and cross-progression work?</strong></h2><p>All players need to sign up for and log in to an Activision account to play Black Ops 6 online, and this allows them to use cross-play and have their progression move with them across platforms. As the latest Call of Duty games also did, Black Ops 6 allows users to connect and play with friends and strangers across all supported systems, and this includes Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p><p>For cross-progression, all game progress is shared on your Activision account. As such, players who start Black Ops 6 on one platform and later move to another will find their progression moves with them. Players must use the same Activision account, however. Progress will not carry over to a different Activision account.</p><p>Cross-play and cross-progression are made possible through your Activision ID. Also referred to as your Display Name, this is a unique account name to your Activision account that allows you to play across systems. The Display Name is your given PSN ID, Gamertag, BattleTag, or Steam ID, extended by a hashmark followed by a series of numbers to make your account unique to you.</p><h2><strong>How to turn off cross-play</strong></h2><p>Not everyone wants to play against people on other platforms, and that's a choice you can make in Black Ops 6. From the system menus, players can choose to toggle cross-play on (allows matchmaking with other gaming platforms) or off (matchmaking only uses current gaming platform). Scaling down to your individual platform will make the player pool smaller, but finding a match in a game as big as Black Ops 6 should not be a problem for anyone, whether or not they have cross-play on or off.</p><h2>How to change your Activision ID/Display Name</h2><p>Activision allows players to change their Activision ID/Display name by applying a "username change token." These tokens are not sold for money but restock every six months--the cap is two tokens at a given time. Here's how to change your details, <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-in-game-account-registration" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as relayed by Activision</a>:</p><p>To change your Activision ID/Display Name in the game, head to the Activision Account screen.</p><ol><li>Press <b>Options</b> on the home screen.</li><li>Go to the <b>ACCOUNT</b> tab and select <b>Activision Account</b>.</li><li>Choose <b>CHANGE DISPLAY NAME</b>.</li><li>Enter your desired name and choose <b>CONFIRM</b>.</li></ol><p>You can also change your Activision ID/Display Name online.</p><ol><li>Log in to your <u><b><a title="callofduty.com/cod/profile" href="https://profile.callofduty.com/cod/profile" rel="nofollow ">Activision account</a></b></u>.</li><li>Select <b>BASIC INFO</b>.</li><li>Select <b>EDIT</b> next to your <b>ACTIVISION ID</b>.</li><li>In the <b>ACCOUNT VERIFICATION REQUIRED</b> pop-up, select <b>SEND CODE</b>.</li><li>Go to your email account to retrieve the one-time verification code.</li><li>Return to the <b>ACCOUNT VERIFICATION REQUIRED</b> pop-up and enter the code.</li><li>On the <b>BASIC INFO</b> tab and select <b>EDIT</b> next to your <b>ACTIVISION ID</b>.</li><li>Enter a new Activision ID/Display Name and select <b>SAVE</b>.</li><li>Enter the password for your Activision account.</li><li>Select <b>SUBMIT</b>.</li></ol><p>For more on Black Ops 6, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-ui-is-arriving-soon-with-the-black-ops-6-preload/1100-6527230/" data-ref-id="1100-6527230">first details on the new UI,</a> as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-launch-times-detailed/1100-6527163/" data-ref-id="1100-6527163">how to preload</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have always had an adversarial relationship with alarm clocks. They are gadgets designed to ruin my most precious time, and in order to work effectively, they must be as annoying as possible. Which is why I was intrigued by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo’s surprise reveal of Alarmo</a>. (Once I got over my surprise of it not being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">the long-awaited Switch 2 announcement</a>.) What if getting up in the morning could be a little more playful? Maybe what I really needed all along was Princess Zelda’s soothing voice or the chirps of tiny pikmin to ease me into consciousness in the morning.</p><p>After a week with Alarmo, I have to admit that it hasn’t changed much about my sleep patterns. It has some clever ideas, and it looks great on a shelf, but ultimately, it’s still an alarm clock.</p><p>But what a cute alarm clock it is. Alarmo is a red cylinder with a rotund white button / knob on top and a 2.8-inch rectangular LCD display with a big ol’ bezel around it that makes it <em>almost</em> seem circular, particularly in the dark. You can pick one of (currently) five different games — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pikmin 4</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a> — to customize how the clockface looks and sounds, so that Link or Captain Olimar can walk around the screen. It’s the kind of thing that’s just nice to look at, and the characters even follow you around when you move in front of it.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Alarmo has a number of Nintendo-ized alarm features. You can choose from 35 video game “scenes” to wake up to, which range from Zelda calmly saying “wake up” to, for some reason, the sound of a pikmin drowning. Each scene starts out relatively chill and will get progressively more intense the longer you stay in bed. The top button will even start flashing colors to get your attention. Alarmo lets you customize the alarm schedule by day of the week, and it tracks your daily sleep times along with how long it takes you to actually wake up after your alarm goes off each day. All of this info is available on the clock itself; it doesn’t sync with other devices or apps.</p><p>Navigating the device is pretty easy: for most things, you simply smack the big button on top. This works for everything from turning a blaring alarm off in the morning to opening the menu to tweak settings. Otherwise, you can twist the button to adjust things — like picking the time for your alarm to go off — and there are also back and notification buttons. (So far, my notifications have all been informing me of existing Alarmo features, but in the future, it will be used to alert users for updates to add more sounds and styles based on games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>. This does require linking an existing Nintendo account to the device, the only real online feature I’ve encountered so far.)</p><p>But you shouldn’t be spending much time with those buttons because Alarmo’s big hook — aside from its Nintendo style — is its millimeter wave motion sensor. The idea is that you can interact with it simply by moving around. When it goes off in the morning, rolling out of the bed is enough to shut the alarm off. Wave your hand around a little, and it will snooze for a few minutes. In my experience, it works well enough, but with one big caveat: Alarmo’s motion sensors can’t distinguish between multiple people. So if I get out of bed but my partner sleeps in, the alarm won’t shut off.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>To be fair, Nintendo notes this issue right on the box (apparently animals can cause issues as well), but it does make the experience a lot less interesting if you share a bed. For most of the week, I’ve had to resort to getting up and turning the alarm off manually so that I don’t get in trouble for ruining my wife’s sleep with loud <em>Splatoon</em> splatters. Of course, given that a large part of the intended audience is children, this won’t be a problem for many people. Then again, my own children didn’t care much for any of the alarm or sleep tracking features anyway; they just thought it was cool having Mario on a clock. Note: this did not make it any easier to wake them up on school days.</p><p>You can also use Alarmo to help you fall back asleep. If you have a bedtime set, soothing sounds will start playing as soon as you get into bed, based on one of the five supported games (again, no button-pressing required). It has worked flawlessly for me, and I’ve become hooked on the<em> Zelda</em> nighttime theme, with its crackling fire and soft, intermittent piano. It’s like I’m dozing off in Hyrule Field after dark. But again, there’s an annoying caveat. For some inexplicable reason, the sounds only play for less than 10 minutes before going silent, so if you’re looking for Nintendo-themed white noise, you are out of luck. Hyrule is gone almost as soon as I finally get comfortable.</p><p>Those kinds of quirks make the actual sleep features of Alarmo feel like more of an afterthought. It’s first and foremost a $100 Nintendo-branded clock. It looks and sounds the part, which is to say, it’s incredibly charming and nostalgic. But if you’re looking for something to help you wake up better than a run-of-the-mill alarm or track your sleep more efficiently than an app on your phone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23449363/best-android-smartwatches-wear-os">this isn’t it</a>. Turns out, even adorable pikmin and inklings can’t change my mind about alarm clocks.</p><p><small>Alarmo is now </small><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F"><small>available to purchase early</small></a> <small>for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and will be released in early 2025 for everyone else.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
