It’s a 2D tower defense game that offers depth for dedicated players, strategic elements, and easy enjoyment for casual players.</p><p><strong>A Lively Parade With hololive VTubers and <a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>cot Characters!</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>HoloParade</em> is a fan game of hololive and the first title to serve as a test case for holo Indie. Collect, nurture, and enjoy watching your favorite characters! It’s a 2D tower defense game that offers depth, strategy, and can also be enjoyed casually.</p><p>To hololive fans:</p><p>This game is designed for players who enjoy strategy and trial and error, and involves exploring various formations and play styles suited to each stage. With stages featuring a variety of characteristics and characters having their specific strengths and weaknesses, please note that you cannot easily clear all stages with just your favorite characters. With careful character development and strategic gameplay, you can clear stages up to the end credits with a favorite formation, but subsequent high-difficulty stages will require formations tailored to the enemies.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles</strong><ul><li>The basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy’s base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.</li><li>Additionally, there’s an element inspired by parades called the “Symphony Effect,” where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Comprehensive Development Elements</strong><ul><li>In addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a “Skill” system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.</li></ul></li><li><strong>No <a title="Genres > Gacha" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/gacha">Gacha</a> Purchases, No Stamina System</strong><ul><li>The scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.</li><li>Moreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office</strong><ul><li>When you return to the office, the home screen, you’ll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive. In the office, talents from hololive may also make appearances, and you might witness some unexpected interactions.</li><li>Additionally, mini-games with gameplay entirely different from the main story have been implemented. These games allow you to collect coins necessary for character strengthening. For now, the mini-games titled “Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!” and “Dancing Subaru” are available. In “Hurry Up! Miko-Chi!”, Sakura Miko (a VTuber affiliated with Hololive), who has overslept, dashes at full speed towards her destination while avoiding obstacles.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Deluxe Edition</em> (Switch) Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="【holo Indie】HoloParade: Deluxe Edition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XPdlc_sOHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="【holo Indie】ホロパレード デラックス版 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhIs0L9AszI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-concept-artist-on-making-nightreign-feel-familiar-but-also-different-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware games have always had a very distinct visual style, So much so, that it's usually pretty easy to predict when that iconic "FromSoftware" logo is about to pop up after a sudden fade to black, even in an announced game trailer for an upcoming FromSoft game. This is thanks to the many talented artists at the studio, and during my time at their office, I got a chance to sit down with one of them, Concept and Environmental Artist Saori Mizuno, to talk about her inspirations, the art direction she was given for Elden Ring Nightreign, and how it differed from her work on previous FromSoft games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So generally, what was different about working on Nightreign versus the base Elden Ring game, or and anything prior that you have worked on with FromSoftware?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Saori Mizuno - Concept Artist on Elden Ring: Nightreign: </strong>In general, for Nightreign, we would receive an order for a design and then if it was myself in charge of that particular concept, then I would iterate on that image that I had, that interpretation of the design and then I would align and collaborate with the other designers and eventually produce the final design. I think one aspect that changed a lot on Nightreign's design process is that we had a lot of back and forth, a lot of brainstorming in person, actually speaking about these designs rather than just getting text-based feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interviewer:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the setting of Nightreign and how you approach making it feel distinct from the base Elden Ring game, despite it being a spinoff that uses a lot of the same assets?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn't want to make it feel too different from Elden Ring, as it used that as a base for the design and the setting. But one specific direction we did get early on was to create something that first feels and looks familiar and gradually transforms into the unfamiliar and into the unknown. So that was a nice sort of policy or a direction that we had to approach with the design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring had this sort of very gorgeous painterly feel to a lot of the environments, but we wanted Nightreign to feel like at a glance beautiful, but if you look a little bit deeper, there's something sinister and there's something darker there. Elden Ring, maybe there's a lot of bright colors in the scenery and in the sky box and such, but we wanted there also, the player to feel a sense of darkness there as well. So that was another aspect of the design that differed slightly from Elden Ring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We didnt want to make it feel too different from Elden Ring."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the locations that really stuck out to me was the Roundtable Hold, which is such a familiar location in the base Elden Ring, and it has such an interesting twist in Nightreign. Can you talk a little bit about what went into the new design for the Roundtable Hold and what were some of the inspirations behind some of those changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Nightreign's new kind of speedier, high-tempo gameplay, we wanted the Roundtable this time in particular to feel like somewhere you could relax and take your time and sort of cool off after that intense three day/night cycle. So we wanted it to feel, from a design perspective, more cozy and more welcoming, more at home. One inspiration was the Fire Link Shrine from Dark Souls 1, where you feel sort of more embraced by the atmosphere. You feel like you are coming home after these hardships, after a hard fought battle, and safe more importantly than anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So from a design perspective, we used techniques such as gentle lighting, a feeling of the surrounding environs as well as the Roundtable Hold itself. And also while a lot of the place is in ruins, we didn't want it to feel completely destroyed and desolate. We wanted it to feel like it was a safe place to come home to and that the player could relax and take their time there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/eldenring-nightreign-09-4k-1748468862562.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another impetus for the design of the Roundtable Hold in Nightreign was this feeling of early morning, so a sort of daybreak, dawn, the player setting off on a new adventure. So that came into some of the lighting and architecture choices that changed in Nightreign, and we wanted the player to be aware of this. We wanted them to be conscious of this when setting out on this new adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So when the player hits day three, they're transported to this brand new location that is really unlike any other in Elden Ring. One that is predominantly white, mixed in with a very colorful sky box full of orange, blue and purple kind of all mixing together. What's the story behind this environment and what were some of the inspirations that went into that work? If you need a visual representation, I have this one.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So one of the first requests we got from the director regarding this environment was that it should feel like a sense of finality and we should get this feeling of buildup before a storm. And that we should also feel like the impression you got from the sky box is that the sky is falling, this calamity is coming to an end. So it's the boss at the end of the third day, so we wanted the player to feel this tightness in their chest like they're getting ready to embark on something greater than themselves and hopefully this culminates and comes through in the design.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/nightreign-02-1748468918611.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To add to that, looking again at the colors and the composition of the sky, we wanted it to feel like something was about to be born from that chaos, from that chaotic scene. Again, the boss culminates at the end of that third-day struggle. We wanted the player to feel this from the use of color and the use of these design elements. And some of the inspirations we took from that were from real-life cosmic events. So something we can't quite understand, something that's very distant and abstracted from regular human perception and we wanted it to feel just as abstract and just as grandiose even within the world of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Just speaking personally, what's something that you yourself are very proud of that you've worked on in Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, one of my favorite areas is actually the area we just talked about, the environment that you enter just before facing that boss at the end of the third day. One of the keywords we found while exploring the design for this environment was this concept of shedding skin. And so this was something that really resonated with me and stuck with me. This idea of personifying the surroundings and the building into something that was once living and has now since been petrified or gone through these ages of time and gone through this whole process. And we wanted players to feel this sense of age, this old fantasy feel from this particular set piece.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that surprised us about Nightreign was the environmental variety, despite it being a much smaller and more condensed kind of world. Was it difficult to achieve this kind of variety in such a small, confined space?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So generally with these kind of emergent map changes and these kind of terrain effects and events, we wanted it to feel like something immediately fresh and exciting, just at a glance. So the player will know there's been an impactful change to the map and to the scenery and they'll have an immediate idea of what they need to do to progress. So for instance, the volcano, the crater that appears, you'd need to sort of dig deeper into it. Or for the snowfield terrain change, you'd need to sort of climb right up to the top of it, this sort of thing. We wanted this to be immediately effective and change the way the players approach and behave in the map just by changing that sense of space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then personally as a designer, who are some of your favorite artists, either classic or contemporary, and are there any people that you can point to as being particularly influential on your work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my personal favorite traditional artists, or classical artists is Zdzisław Beksiński. I took a lot of inspiration from his various expressions when designing my work. Also with the concept of Nightreign and battling the Night Lords after these repeated plays, I felt like this is inherent to the game design. And so I wanted this feeling to come through in the designs I created as well. And one sense I got from that was from watching the film Spirited Away from Hayao Miyazaki. This feeling of being unable to go home, unable to escape from a dream. This sort of feeling I wanted to kind of harness while designing these worlds and tried to get that through to the player as they play through the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when designing Limveld, that initial map, that initial environment on the first day, I wanted it to feel beautiful. Like from an outward glance, it looks beautiful and inviting, but pretty quickly you feel like something's off or something's not quite right. So I think that is a part of the inspiration that we definitely got across in the design of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So switching to video games really quick, can you just talk about what are some of your favorite video games that may have inspired your work as well?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I enjoy Diablo II and other such multiplayer games. I enjoy open world survival games where you have to sort of start from scratch and build your own house and things like that world. I like a variety of indies and I've also had a fondness for a Legend of Zelda since childhood, games like Majora's Mask, which kind of are obviously really fun to play, but they sort of have this… again, this sense of repeat play and this kind of sense of darkness to them as well. I think that's stuck with me since childhood. So yeah.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then a final question. A lot of designers and artists like to make their own personal imprints on a game. Are there any secrets or Easter eggs that you managed to sneak in yourself into the game? Or is there maybe anything that you hope players will see and enjoy as they play?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes. I don't think you'd call this a sort of a signature as an artist, but one important thing that I paid attention to while designing Nightreign was this sort of all encompassing theme of the night and how we go about expressing that. We obviously tried various things and various methods and Limveld is ultimately a place that you keep coming back to as a player. So we thought one way we could express that was these changes throughout the three-day structure and what players can notice as their journey progresses. What keeps them coming back and what keeps them interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so to talk a bit more about that theme of night, we had to explore what night meant to us as designers, like as a base concept. So of course, night brings with it some negative connotations, like the dark and fear and the unknown, things like this. So we wanted at first when the player jumps into this world to feel those kind of negative feelings conveyed quite directly and have that sense of anxiety and that sense of fear of the unknown.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We had to explore what night meant to us as designers, like as a base concept."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So we conveyed this straight up with things like the imposed time limit and the encroaching circle of rain, things like this. But we found that night is, we didn't want it to be fully negative. Again, once the players get used to that cycle and they get used to what they're seeing, we wanted it to be more than that. We wanted players to kind of begin to almost yearn for the night and sort of look forward to this encroaching darkness and maybe even feel a sense of comfort from it, from getting used to this rhythm and these aspects. So as the game progresses and the player is kind of getting used to these things, that's definitely an aspect of the design that we wanted to incorporate and be a part of that player experience.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost exactly one month ago</a>: EA, as part of an ongoing transition to <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on</a> “owned IP, sports, and massive online communities” – and, of course, a loving and committed relationship with making the line go up – has canceled a promising in-development project based on a big-name series, laying off numerous talented people in the process. Previously, <em>Titanfall </em>took a tumble. This time, it’s <em>Black Panther</em> that’s met a decidedly un-heroic end.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN reports</a> that EA has canceled a little-seen but eagerly anticipated<em> Black Panther </em>open-world action-adventure game and shut down Cliffhanger Games, a studio formed only a couple years ago in 2023. Some members of EA’s mobile and central teams are also on the chopping block. EA has not specified the exact number of people affected, but according to IGN, it’s “less than the roughly 300 roles cut last month across Respawn and EA's Fan Care teams.” In an email to staff, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said recent shakeups are part of an effort to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities." She added that EA is attempting to find laid-off developers new roles within the company.</p><p>It’s worth noting that as of March 2025, EA <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed 800 more people</a> than at the same time last year, meaning that the company is not shrinking – at least in terms of net employee count. Still, this is cold comfort to those impacted by layoffs, whose hard work now lines the wastebasket of history and who – more invisibly but no less crucially – see their teams scattered to the winds. These aren’t just talented individuals; they are rock-solid <em>teams</em>. Game making is a collective effort, honed over the course of multiple projects. It’s a process just as much as it’s an art, a daily trudge toward learning each others’ ins, outs, and idiosyncrasies.</p><p>Just to give you an idea of How Things Are Going on that front, Cliffhanger Games was made up of <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor </em>vets coming from Monolith Productions. Monolith, you’ll remember, was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> game with WB until… that project was also canned, and Monolith, a decades-old studio, was <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unceremoniously sacrificed</a> at the altar of growth at all costs. In the span of just a few months, we went from multiple Monolith and Monolith-adjacent teams cooking in shared kitchens to zero. I’m sure at least a few folks will find new means of sticking together, but as long as this industry insists on viewing people as numbers – whether on a spreadsheet or as manpower to bolster a random live service game’s ceaseless maintenance machine – this will be the end result.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <p>
The heroes in a half shell are back, and this time they're pressing right up against your eyeballs. That's thanks to their debut VR outing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>: Empire City, which is coming to Meta Quest 3 and SteamVR sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
Empire City is the work of Cortopia Studios - which co-developed last year's well-received gladiatorial bludgeon-'em-up Gorn 2 - and follows Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo in an action-adventure set on (and presumably under) the Foot Clan-infested streets of New York City following Shredder's demise.
</p>
<p>
It's an adventure described as "equal parts hard-hitting combat and an exploration of the bonds of brotherhood", and there's talk of "fluid parkour" as players - and up to three friends - scale the urban landscape. Fan-favourite villains are also promised, all readying for a walloping - in battles built around strikes and blocks - with each turtle's signature weapon.

<p>
And that, apart from confirmation The Last Ronin author Tom Waltz is saving as narrative consultant, is about all we know. The teaser trailer above isn't much more informative, but you'll find a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713650/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Empire_City/">handful of screenshots over on Steam</a>. Expect more details in the run up to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City's Steam VR and Meta Quest release in 2026.
</p>
<p>
It's been busy few years for the Turtles, of course; following 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shredders-revenge-is-a-reminder-of-the-richness-and-joy-of-16-bit-animations">brilliant beat-'em-up Shredder's Revenge</a> and acclaimed 2023 movie outing Mutant Mayhem, last year brought the fairly middling Mutants Unleashed and rogue-like Splintered Fate. Strange Scaffold took on the series earlier this month, nudging it into turn-based strategy territory with Tactical Takedown, and it's already been confirmed more games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> - are on the way. As a scaly green youth once put it, "Totally tubular, dude!"

And you know what, after reading this 500+ word post, I do believe him. I think Pitchford really didn’t expect his short tweet to set off a firestorm. But it did, and at this point, I’m not sure posting over and over again about it is helping. If anything, it just leads to more people learning about the original comment and, as a result, more discourse happening. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ouau9SVVrBA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ouau9SVVrBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He’s like Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes</a></span>. Each post angers more people, making the situation worse. It’s time to put the phone down, walk away, and let the internet move on to something else. So, that’s my advice to you, Randy. Log off, dude. </p><p>Anyway, here’s the full post, lightly formatted so it is easier to read:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I am sorry there was a misunderstanding. The absolute sincere truth is that I don’t want anyone to pay any more than they should or are comfortable with and I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they pay. </p><p>The actual context was that a guy replied to a post about Borderlands 4 on the Nintendo Switch 2 was warning me that if the price ends up being $80, the game will fail. What I was trying to do was explain that it wasn’t my call but that if a $10 price increase does happen (since that’s obviously where the industry is going), it will be okay and that Borderlands 4 will be okay because it’s a great game and there are a lot of fans who will see the value and want it. </p><p> I think my trying to short hand that using the phrase “real fans” triggered some people and I saw that it got inflated as if I was making some big statement (I wasn’t - I was just trying to help someone who I thought was sincerely worried about us and looking out for us) and I could see that it was being pressed into the idea that I was taking the audience for granted (which is a super shitty look, but it was not at all my intent and does not reflect at all how I feel). </p><p>The sincere truth is that I’m grateful that anyone likes our games and humbled that so many fans show up to enjoy and support what we do. </p><p>As an artist, I don’t want prices to go up because I want everyone to have access to what we create. I get that business is a thing and that the market and economy are driving prices up and sooner or later we’re going to have to all adapt to that so that the creative engine can make at least as much as it spends to provide us with amazing content. Whatever the case, I’m here to try to entertain people and my priority has always been to try to add some joy and happiness and creativity to the world. To whatever extent I succeed at that, I am grateful and honored and take on every effort with passion and humility. </p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> May I recommend you consider the people who create entertainment you enjoy are actual, real people who sincerely are working to try to make cool stuff. I have dedicated my life to video games as entertainment and I have made the choice to be accessible on here. I don’t want to let edge cases ruin that for the majority of people who find value in using this medium for a positive connection, but I cannot help that there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to at least try to help those that don’t get it to gain some perspective and some dignity in how they choose to interact. </p><p> I’m not claiming I’m perfect. But I don’t deserve any less latitude than anyone else. I choose to think of others with the most amount of charity and am often surprised to discover some that jump to the worst possible way to consider a thing as doing that is just counter to my nature. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Splatoon is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, May 28, 2025. Below, we examine how it reached outside the realm of video games for its unique blend of inspirations.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It is easy to understand Splatoon as a riff on prior video games. It's a multiplayer shooter produced in the years after competitive shooters started to dominate online play. But it subverts type, offering something tuned for children and families, rather than teens and young adults. Its cartoon style and emphasis on objectives other than "kill" or "hold this position" set it apart from most other games of its ilk. But Splatoon's originality goes deeper. It proves that the strangest and most exciting ideas emerge when you look outside of regular avenues of video games, like wildlife, pop music and street fashion, and borrow what you can from them.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo didn't start development of Splatoon with the intention to make a family-friendly multiplayer shooter. <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wiiu/splatoon/0/0/" rel="nofollow ">Former CEO Satoru Iwata</a> said in an interview the developers wanted to create "a new kind of game, without worrying about trying to fit into existing game genres." From that initial seed came 70 ideas, which the team narrowed down to Splatoon. Its unique flavor comes in part from that wide-open approach. To be fair, this is an interview for promotional purposes, conducted by Nintendo employees with an active stake in making the best impression possible. Who knows how much of this is the unvarnished truth? But it is still striking how little video game terminology shows up and how many of the design questions raised are ones of intuition and common sense.</p><p dir="ltr">When you look at Splatoon's finished product, every portion of it fits together, from how its squid characters hide in ink and how its paint-splattering mechanics pair with street art aesthetics. But it took a lot of careful thinking and iteration to get it that way. The first design that captured the dev team's imagination featured characters covering a battlefield in ink, but these characters were tofu blocks, not squid. Why tofu? Well, the tofu's block shape and simple colors made it disappear into the ink, turning the straightforward shooter into a tense cat-and-mouse game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502943-wiiu_splatoon_scrn_09_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502943" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502943-wiiu_splatoon_scrn_09_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502943"></a><figcaption>Squid Kids gear up for Splatoon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502943-wiiu_splatoon_scrn_09_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the tofu was a problem. The lack of any human features made it feel silly. How could you market a game with tofu characters? At first, the team settled on rabbits, for a number of practical reasons. Their stark color palettes would make it easy to see when they'd been inked and their ears act as a simple visual marker of the direction they were looking. There was only one problem: rabbits didn't make any sense. Co-director Yusuke Amano said, "When people asked 'Why rabbits?' and 'Why are the rabbits shooting ink?' we couldn’t give them a rational explanation." After brainstorming a number of things characters needed to have in the game--including "a motif where it makes sense for it to be squirting ink"--the team settled on squids.</p><p dir="ltr">Now the game's characters felt reasonable, but the new design also created new ideas for gameplay. The squid's ability to swim through the ink enabled traversal on the walls to flank enemies. This intuitive approach extends to the rest of the game. Splatoon can get complex, but the weapons resemble water guns, aerosol cans, buckets, paint brushes and rollers, things most of Splatoon's player base have used or have seen used in their real lives. There is an immediacy to how those tools work that makes them appealing. Even more intuitive shooters like Halo still rely on some prior knowledge of firearms. You don't need that in Splatoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Spreading ink on walls and floors also brings graffiti and, by extension, street fashion to mind. The team made that connection before they settled on squid characters. Part of what makes each of the three Splatoon games wonderful is how they draw on specific, sometimes local, subcultures. Diving into the fashion that inspired Splatoon will take you from the monochrome runway looks of designer <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/yohji-yamamoto-y3-designer-interview-2023" rel="nofollow ">Youji Yamamoto</a> to the iconographic style of artist <a href="https://sabukaru.online/articles/sk8thing-in-the-shadows" rel="nofollow ">Sk8thing</a>. Scrolling through this brief history of <a href="https://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/ura-harajuku-history" rel="nofollow ">Tokyo neighborhood Ura-Harajuku</a> and its streetwear will showcase looks and locations that could be found in Inkopolis. The games' Squid girl idols pull from digital pop stars like Hatsune Miku, even as they also take from the real world of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/26/17163674/nintendo-splatoon-art-design-interview-hisashi-nogami" rel="nofollow ">American Hip Hop</a>. These influences give the game a style that extends beyond its own borders. Getting into Splatoon could be, and for many players has been, a gateway to lots of other cool stuff.</p><p dir="ltr">In a strange way, Splatoon anticipated Fortnite, with its emphasis on player-chosen aesthetics, seasonal community events, and cartoonish, kid-friendly vibes. But in another sense, the difference could not be more stark. Fortnite wants to be everything to everyone: a platform for music festivals, movie trailers, and entirely new games. It eats everything from Star Wars and Marvel to Sabrina Carpenter and Ariana Grande. Meanwhile, every Splatoon game has had big, final Splatfests after which the game no longer runs events. Fortnite's malleable plastic aspirations have spread to every multiplayer game, while Splatoon remains its own thing, even with the occasional Nintendo tie-in.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Splatoon can still be craven. In Splatfests, teams of players pick sides in weekend wars between teams like "Pirates vs. Ninjas" or "Early Bird vs. Night Owl." The intention was to bring social media attention to the game by using common keyphrases and cultural debates. But that also has the effect of grounding Splatoon in subcultures outside itself. Splatfests create a normalcy and routine that each new event both affirms and disrupts. They are naked attempts to boost player numbers and generate free advertising. But when they're at their best, Splatfests feel like block parties.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502944-vs02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502944" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502944-vs02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502944"></a><figcaption>An ink-soaked battlefield in Splatoon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502944-vs02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Which brings us to Splatoon's run at social media. As you explore Inkopolis, you can find drawings and scrawlings from other players. You can still find posts like this if you walk around in Splatoon 2 or 3. Though the system draws from the interfaces of Instagram and Twitter, there is no algorithm to tailor what you see. The town square can only show you what people are saying right now. The result is something immediate and buzzy, but it can't hold your attention long-term.</p><p dir="ltr">All these pieces come together to create perhaps the most profound element of Splatoon: the feeling of a particular time and place. Splatoon’s aesthetics are not vacuous imitations, but grounded homages. Its social media and events give the feeling of a world beyond the borders of the game. Splatoon feels like a real place, albeit one that you can only ever visit. That is because it only could have been made by that team at that time in that place. In 2015, we were on the verge of a wholly different gaming ecosystem. Fortnite Battle Royale was only two years away. Splatoon’s emphasis on avatar customization and seasonal events put it in immediate conversation with what was to come. Yet it could not be more different. Splatoon’s seasonal events had a definite end-date. It lacked endless cross-media promotion (outside of the occasional Nintendo crossover). It did not chase everyone, everywhere, all of the time, but was instead content for a dedicated audience for that moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Befitting all that, Splatoon was not a well of endless entertainment. Its servers have long been down. You can't play the game that people played back in 2015. That death weirdly echoes Splatoon’s narrative of a post-apocalyptic world where humans have long been gone. The squid people wear clothes like the clothes humans wore, play games like the humans played, and make the same kind of music they made too. There are differences, but it is the same too. Perhaps that squid world will die, like the human world did, but wasn't it beautiful while it lasted?</p>

            <p>
CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel has officially shed its Project Orion codename and will henceforth be known as Cyberpunk 2. That's as the studio provides its latest development update, confirming it's now entered the pre-production phase.
</p>
<p>
A Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">formally announced back in 2022</a>, and CD Projekt has been providing investors with progress updates on its development since then. Most recently, back in March, it revealed Project Orion was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">nearing the end of its concept phase</a> and would be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". And now, as per the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-beginning-of-2025/">studio's Q1 2025 earnings results</a>, pre-production is officially underway.
</p>
<p>
Announcing its latest development milestone, CD Projekt also took the opportunity to jettison the Project Orion codename and instead begin referring to the sequel simply as Cyberpunk 2. This doesn't, however, mean the name will permanently stick; CD Projekt <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">told The Verge</a> Cyberpunk 2 "just means it's another game in the Cyberpunk universe."

<p>
Despite these notable developments, Cyberpunk 2's team size has only seen a modest increase since the beginning of the year, with 96 developer now confirmed to be working on the project versus 84 in February. The bulk of the studio, as expected, is currently focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, with 422 employees assigned to the project. That's compared to the modest 49 developers working on multiplayer The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, and the 19 on Project Hadar - which is planned to be the studio's first-ever original game.
</p>
<p>
All these production updates were accompanied by a number of sales milestones. Cyberpunk 2077 expansion Project Liberty has, for instance, now sold over 10m copies, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - which this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-cd-projekt-red-when-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-launched">celebrates its tenth anniversary</a> - has seen over 60m sales. 
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, CD Projekt has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">priming a Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a> to release alongside the console next week, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Mac port is also on the way</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-actor-celebrates-witcher-4-protagonist-ciri-following-woke-criticism">Ciri-starring Witcher 4</a> is likely still some considerable way off, with the newly monikered Cyberpunk 2 - which will reportedly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Eurogamer/posts/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-features-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-se/">take players to second city like "Chicago gone wrong"</a> - to follow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-setup-and-system-settings-menu-revealed-still-only-includes-basic-white-and-black-themes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 systems are <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-nintendo-switch-2-used-day-1-update/">starting to appear out in the wild</a>, and one person who was able to get their hands on the system early has taken the liberty of showcasing what the whole setup process looks like when you first turn on your Switch 2, minus all the parts that don't work because the system doesn't have the day one patch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-%E2%80%94-first-setup-menu-walkthrough.1200999/">Russian YouTube channel</a> took the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y49k7XwfE6k&amp;t=4s">publishing a video</a> that goes through the entire setup process for the Nintendo Switch 2, with the volume maxed, so viewers can hear the intro music and everything else that goes on when setting up your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The video was quickly taken down, which is not surprising as Nintendo is likely trying to keep a lid on these leaks with the console's launch only days away. But not before Wccftech, and many others could check out the video and see that much hasn't changed when it comes to the console's home screen.</p>
<p>Even in the system's settings, you won't see many changes regarding the layout and the options available. Some things are new, like the option to bump resolutions on the TV that you connect your Switch 2 device to up to 4K, but much has stayed the same, including the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 only comes with two basic themes for the console: White and Black.</p>
<p>There's always the potential that more will be added, but that's what we thought when the original Switch launched in 2017. Eight years later, we still have two basic themes available.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what else has changed and what else has stayed the same with the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5, 2025, and it can be used with the day one patch downloaded.</p>

			<p>Today, Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Copilot for Gaming in beta testing for mobile devices (iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass.beta&amp;hl=en-US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>). The early preview can be found in the beta version of the Xbox mobile app in select countries:&nbsp;Albania, Algeria Moldova, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkiye, UAE, Ukraine, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In Microsoft's words, Copilot for Gaming aims to be the 'ultimate sidekick' for gamers. Users can access Copilot for Gaming on a second screen without distractions from the core gameplay experience. The AI knows which game they're playing and understands their Xbox activity, so it can answer questions about games players are interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the player's account, play history, and achievements.</p>
<p>Example prompts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Hey Copilot, can you remind me what materials I need to craft a sword in Minecraft?”</em></li>
<li><em>“(While playing South of Midnight): I’m stuck on Rougarou right now. Can you give me some tips on how to beat this boss?'”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m looking for a new RPG. Can you recommend something that has recently been released on Xbox?”</em></li>
<li><em>“‘Hey Copilot, what’s the rarest achievement you can get in Avowed?’”</em></li>
<li><em>“I love horror movies. Any suggestions for what game I should play?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What was the last achievement I got in Starfield?”</em></li>
<li><em>“When does my Game Pass subscription renew?”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature will be improved over time, just as you'd expect in this case, with better personalization, proactive tips, and more. Testers can leave feedback under “More Options” in the app's top left corner, or simply by rating the answers with thumbs up or down.</p>

		<p>EA is cancelling its Black Panther game and shutting down developer Cliffhanger Games, it’s been reported by IGN.</p>
<p>The source of the news is an email sent to staff by EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, the layoffs joining the waves of broader job cuts being made at the company and across the industry. Thankfully, it appears that the layoffs from closing Cliffhanger Games, alongside cuts in its mobile and central teams, are smaller than the 300 jobs lost last month and previous cuts, though the numbers are not clear with EA refusing to comment to IGN. Additionally, EA is trying to move individual employees to other roles within the company, filling gaps and roles from within.</p>


<p>In the email, Miele said this is happening to “sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.”</p>
<p>She continued, “These decisions are hard. They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/10/black-panther-videogame-ea/">Black Panther was part of a three game deal that EA cut with Disney in 2023</a>, founding Cliffhanger as a brand new studio for the project, being lead by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith, and with talent who have experience on big franchises such as Halo Infinite, God of War, Call of Duty and others.</p>

<p>The studio and the project ran for around two years – it was announced in July 2023 – which would be a typical timeframe for shifting from pre-production to full development, requiring a more significant financial commitment from EA and hiring or contractors being brought in to support this.</p>
<p>While CEO Andrew Wilson indicated that EA wanted to move away from licensed IP,&nbsp;EA is still committed to working on other Disney franchises, including an Iron Man game in development at Motive, and a third Star Wars: Jedi title from Respawn. There is also a third unannounced title in the deal signed with Marvel.</p>

He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you, like me, have begun to pick out accessories for your Switch 2 before it arrives on June 5th, here’s a money-saving tip: a handful of Hori’s upcoming accessories are at least 30 percent off at Amazon. My favorite (and arguably the most stylish) among the bunch is the Puff Pouch carrying case. Its design evokes the look of a puffy jacket, if not quite to the level of premium puffiness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FmppnElGjvk">Apple’s zip-up case for the Vision Pro headset</a>.</p><p>The Puff Pouch zips open and shut, with a handle on one of its long sides. It boasts room for the console, up to six game cartridges, and extra accessories, like a small battery, the power brick, or a webcam. Even though there’s a Switch 2 logo patch embroidered into the pouch’s fabric, there’s nothing stopping you from using it with an original Switch instead. That’ll be our little secret. Originally priced at $44.99, this case is $29.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pouch-Black-Carrying-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F63YT3C9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and comes out June 16th.</p><p>For an extra $5 (totaling to $34.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Adventure-Pack-Black-Shoulder-Officially/dp/B0F63VZ6N2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>), you might prefer Hori’s Switch 2 crossbody shoulder bag. It offers a similar amount of storage capacity to the Puff Pouch, and can also be used to tote the Switch 2, or any of the original Switch models. As an alternative to wearing the bag, you can also carry it by hand with its strap. This one comes out June 30th.</p><p>The last (for now) discounted Hori product is its Dual USB PlayStand, a small USB hub that gives your console more ports for accessories, much like the TV dock does. It has two USB-A ports for controllers, plus a USB-C port in case you want to keep your Switch 2 charged as you play. Normally $69.99 (whew, that’s costly), it’s selling at a more reasonable (but still pretty steep) $39.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Dual-PlayStand-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F63VJ13M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. This product also releases on June 30th.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
EA has reportedly cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the studio behind it, resulting in an unspecified number of layoffs.
</p>
<p>
EA Entertainment president Laura Miele shared the news in an email to staff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">seen by IGN</a>, insisting today's Black Panther cancellation, the closure of Cliffhanger Games, and the resulting job losses - as well the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">recent cancellation of other projects</a>, including an unannounced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game at Respawn - would help the publisher "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."
</p>
<p>
EA declined to comment on the number of employees impacted by its latest round of layoffs when approached by IGN (these will reportedly also affect members of the publisher's mobile and central divisions), but the website says it understands fewer individuals will be affected compared to the 300 job cuts recently made across Respawn and several other teams.
</p>
<p>
"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We're doing everything we can to support them - including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."
</p>
<p>
EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-single-player-black-panther-game-from-new-studio">announced its Black Panther title</a> back in 2023, confirming it would be handled by its then-new Cliffhanger Games studio in collaboration with Marvel Games. Although few details were shared at the time, it was described as a third-person title set in an "expansive and reactive" version of Wakanda, and still "early in development". Nothing has been seen of the project since then, but a job listing in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-black-panther-game-will-be-open-world-recruitment-ad-suggests">indicated it would be an open-world game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Black Panther's cancellation follows EA CEO Andrew Wilson's comments last year that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">publisher would be moving away from "future licensed IP"</a>. And while Miele insisted EA will continue to invest in developer Motive's Iron Man project and Respawn's third Star Wars: Jedi game, she suggested the focus will now be on a small number of its own franchises, specifically Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. That's in addition to Bioware's next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.
</p>
<p>
Notably, EA also recently announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-its-pausing-development-on-future-rally-games-as-wrc-partnership-ends">ending its licensing partnership with the World Rally Championship</a> and "pausing development" on all future rally games - a move which resulted in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">undisclosed number of additional layoffs</a> at Codemasters.
</p>
<p>
A second Black Panther project - publisher Skydance Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, which is being penned by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Electronic Arts has just cut up one of it's marquee upcoming games, the <em>Black Panther</em> game that Cliffhanger Games had been working on.</p>

<p>First reported by IGN, the information came from an email sent by EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, who shared that this change alongside others was to put their focus where they thought there was the opportunity for the most growth. Beyond Cliffhanger Games, and other recent cancellations like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Respawn Layoffs Part of Wider EA Staff Cuts, Titanfall Project Reportedly Axed">Respawn and an untitled <em>Titanfall</em></a><em> </em>project, people have been laid off on its mobile, and central teams. While this is believed to be less than was laid off last month's 300 people, it is still a significant amount.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-panther-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Black Panther Game Officially In The Works From New EA AAA Studio">Cliffhanger Games was announced in 2023 </a>along with the announcement of the <em>Black Panther</em> project, although formation of the team began in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-monolith-vp-kevin-stephens-starting-new-ea-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ex-Monolith VP Kevin Stephens starting new EA studio">2021 with Kevin Stephens</a>, formerly of Monolith Productions tagged as the studio lead. From the getgo, the goal was to target an area that EA has seemingly had some trouble with - the open world adventure category, particularly with sandboxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stephens, a former VP at Monolith, brought experience working on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor"><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> </a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review-nemesis-reborn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Middle-earth: Shadow of War Review - A Nemesis Reborn"><em>Shadow of War</em> </a>games which were successes in the genre, with <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> a particularly innovative title. Rumors that it was a <em>Black Panther</em> game they were doing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumor-black-panther-open-world-game-apparently-in-development" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" [Rumor] Black Panther Open World Game Apparently In Development">began circulating in 2022</a>, a year before it was revealed.</p>

<p>According to Miele, EA will be helping people find opportunities within EA, meaning that we may see less people laidoff than we would otherwise, instead merely having to uproot their lives at the whims of corporate decisions. The email also tells us a bit of what we can expect from EA Entertainment (Sports is it's own division): a focus on a handful of franchises. Those will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA Details New Battlefield's Gunplay and Movement in First Dev Diary"><em>Battlefield</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Sims 4"><em>The Sims</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA's New Skate Game Won't Let You Play It Offline"><em>Skate</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Apex%20Legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/games/apex-legends"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>. Miele states that the <em>Iron Man</em> game in work at Motive Studios will continue, as will the third <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Star%20Wars%20Jedi:%20Survivor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor"><em>Star Wars: Jedi</em> </a>game, and&nbsp;Bioware's work on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-teases-new-mass-effect-epsilon-as-direct-sequel-to-me3-with-cryptic-video-hints" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="BioWare Teases New Mass Effect as Possible Sequel to ME3 With Cryptic Video &amp; Hints ">next <em>Mass Effect</em> game</a>. This comes also after they announced the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA &quot;Pausing Development on Future Rally Titles&quot;">pausing of various racing games </a>that had been in the works earlier this month.</p>

<p>One missing game from that list however is the third unannounced Marvel game that EA signed a deal for back when they announced <em>Iron Man</em> as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eas-iron-man-just-start-of-three-game-marvel-deal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA's Iron Man Just The Start Of Three Game Marvel Deal">3 game deal</a>. Whether that game continues, or if it is never to even be announced is unknown with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Electronic Arts to Lay Off 5% of Its Workforce, Star Wars FPS Action Game by Respawn Canceled">EA souring on work with licensed properties</a>. Of course, we should take any future plans with a grain of salt - only two months ago Cliffhanger Games was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cliffhanger-games_hiring-jobalert-jobopening-activity-7303112096915902466-2xDw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAWFcNgBTnKdYM4ShDjI2C0H2DackkNIFLU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cliffhanger Games Hiring People">looking to fill a number of roles</a>, and now it's shutting down.</p>

<p>Thus we can add <em>Black Panther</em> to the long list of games we'll never see, with its brief teaser being almost all the public footage that there is of it.</p>

IGN also reports that as a result of the cancellation, Cliffhanger Games has been shut down.</p><p>Cliffhanger Games <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/meet-cliffhanger-games">was a new game studio</a> created to develop <em>Black Panther</em> and run by Kevin Stephens, who was the studio head for the now shuttered<em> Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> developer Monolith Productions. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23787287/ea-black-panther-game-single-player">Beyond an initial announcement in 2023</a>, all that was known of <em>Black Panther</em> was that it was a single-player game with an original narrative and developed in collaboration with Marvel Games. EA and Marvel announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23432986/ea-disney-marvel-iron-man-three-new-games-collaboration">a three-game partnership deal in 2022</a>. In addition to <em>Black Panther</em>, the other two games in the deal were an Iron Man title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363085/ea-marvel-iron-man-game-motive-studio">currently in production at Motive Studio</a> and an unannounced action game.</p><p>According to IGN, the cancellation comes with layoffs in other sectors of EA’s business. The publisher recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667441/ea-return-to-office-work-hybrid">an RTO mandate</a> requiring employees come in at least three days a week, and a round of layoffs occurred earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">impacting between 300 and 400 employees</a>. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to EA for comment.</p><p>The game’s cancellation does not spell the end for the hope of a Black Panther-led title. Over at Skydance New Media, Amy Hennig and team are working on <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/666270/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></em>, which features Captain America and Black Panther as playable characters.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, May 28th: </strong>An earlier version of this story misstated the names of the developers involved. It has been corrected.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is the third round of layoffs at EA this year.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Electronic Arts is canceling its planned Black Panther game and shutting down developer Cliffhanger Games, IGN has learned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email sent to staff from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, Miele said that these changes, alongside other recent cancellations and layoffs, are being done to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to closing Cliffhanger and canceling Black Panther, EA is also laying off some individuals on both its mobile and central teams. When asked for an exact number of individuals impacted, EA declined to comment. IGN understands the total number of affected individuals in this wave is less than the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">roughly 300 roles cut last month</a> across Respawn and EA's Fan Care teams - but cannot confirm by how much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with past rounds of layoffs, EA is endeavoring to place affected individuals in other roles across the company. The company has made use of this placement program with each round of layoffs in recent years, an effort that remains possible despite the constant team cuts likely due to EA seemingly drastically increasing headcount on other teams at the same time. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Per Game File's reporting</a>, EA employed 800 more people as of March of this year than it did the same time in 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Miele's email continues, the company is focusing on a small handful of franchises going forward: Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. Miele also reassures EA will continue to invest in its Iron Man game at Motive and the third Star Wars: Jedi game, as well as it maintain its mobile business despite today's cuts, while Bioware works on the next Mass Effect. Additionally, last year, CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the company would be</a> "moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The email doesn't mention EA Sports, but this is due to Miele running EA Entertainment, while EA Sports is a separate division. IGN understands that the sports division is unaffected by these changes for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Marvel and EA's agreement for Black Panther was part of a three-game deal that included Iron Man and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-and-ea-sign-three-game-deal-starting-with-iron-man">a third, unannounced title</a>. IGN understands this partnership will continue, with Motive Studios leading future Marvel titles. EA provided the following statement regarding the deal with Marvel to IGN, attributed to Miele: "Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Little has been shown of Black Panther so far since its announcement in 2023, though we know from a job listing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eas-black-panther-appears-to-be-an-open-world-sandbox-based-on-job-posting">it was to be a single-player, action-adventure, open-world game</a>. Black Panther was being developed by the newly-formed, now-closed Cliffhanger Games, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-ea-studio-dedicated-to-open-world-action-adventure-will-be-led-by-former-monolith-studio-head">formed in 2023</a> with some former developers of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-from-some-of-the-developers-behind-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">headed up by Kevin Stephens</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cuts come on the heels of multiple other rounds of layoffs and cancelations at EA over the last few years and especially in 2025. Just last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off roughly 300 individuals</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">around 100 at Respawn, while canceling an in-development Titanfall game and another incubation project</a>. Earlier this year, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving some developers to other projects</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off others</a>. In 2024, there was a massive restructuring at EA that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 workers</a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn.</a> And in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">50 jobs were cut at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number were cut at Codemasters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA recently implemented <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">mandatory return-to-office for all workers,</a> a move that some employees told IGN has left many currently remote workers with concerns about what will happen to their roles long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for comment on the exact number impacted, the reasons for these repeated cuts, or if more cuts are expected in the near future, EA referred IGN back to Miele's email. Marvel has not yet responded to IGN's request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft announced today that it is rolling out a beta version of Copilot for Gaming to mobile platforms. Testers on iOS and Android can now try out Microsoft's first attempt at integrating an AI assistant with its Xbox platform.</p><p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Microsoft shared that users of the beta version of the Xbox app for mobile can now try out Copilot for Gaming's chatbot functionality. The AI assistant is designed to link into your Xbox account and be able to answer questions about your Xbox history, current gameplay, games in general, and other topics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502812" data-ratio="0.559375" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502812"></a><figcaption>Copilot for Gaming is now in beta on the Xbox mobile app (via Microsoft).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4502812-wire-article-flat-1430x800-1-1a8597dc612fc468b83f.jpg"></figure><p>Microsoft suggests that Copilot will be able to answer particularly specific or context-sensitive questions, such as advice on certain encounters in games, guidance on improving your Gamerscore, or particularly rare Achievements in certain games. Right now, Copilot incorporates your Xbox profile with information gathered from Bing searches, but Microsoft says that deeper personalization is in development. It's currently unclear exactly how often and in what way Copilot will be gathering information from profiles, and Microsoft has yet to explain how its answers might cite sources that it crawls while searching Bing. Finally, while Copilot is currently reactive--it waits for you to ask it something--Microsoft also states that <em>proactive </em>guidance for in-game activity is in the works.</p><p>The Copilot for Gaming beta is available in <a href="https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/05/Full-Region-List-for-Copilot-for-Gaming-Beta-Early-Testing-on-Mobile-Devices.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a bunch of countries</a> (including the US and Canada), but it has yet to launch in the UK and Europe. The company is working on bringing it to more regions in the future.</p><p>Microsoft has been quite active in announcing AI functionality coming to games.

The tech giant has also increasingly proposed using AI to generate game content, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-carmack-defends-microsofts-ai-generated-quake-ii-level/1100-6530678/" data-ref-id="1100-6530678">its creation of a Quake II level using an AI model</a>.</p>

                <p>A new first-person, open-world RPG is climbing the Steam charts, and it may be a good choice for those who have already blasted through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered</a> and are looking to continue scratching that Skyrim itch.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon/" data-ref-id="5000-522553">Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon</a> is $45 and fully released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466060/Tainted_Grail_The_Fall_of_Avalon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 23, having been in early access since 2023. It looks to have found an audience on Steam in particular, where as of writing it's the number three best-selling game and is only a few spots below Oblivion Remastered on the most-played charts. It also sports "Very positive" reviews on the platform.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hDQNtPceEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3hDQNtPceEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Heavily influenced by first-person RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-skyrim/2900-5554/" data-ref-id="2900-5554">games like Skyrim</a> and Oblivion, Tainted Grail takes place in a dark fantasy world inspired by Arthurian legend. It features branching storylines and morally ambiguous choices where players will shape the future of King Arthur's now ruined kingdom, according to the game's Steam page.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking for a massive open-world RPG to sink their teeth into will find plenty to do here, as the game's Steam page states Tainted Grail is 50-70 hours long and features over 200 side quests, spread out across the game's three distinct zones. When it comes to combat and character creation, players can freely swap between melee weapons, shields, magic, and throwable items.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Questline, a studio of about 50 people, makes clear that players can create various archetypes ranging from a "blacksmith-mage summoning undead hordes" to a "stealthy archer lurking in the shadows." Just like in The Elder Scrolls, there is also crafting in the form of blacksmithing, alchemy, and cooking, as well as farming, journaling, fishing, and more. Also like Like in Elder Scrolls, Tainted Grail can technically be played in third-person, but was built for first-person in mind. Questline called the third-person option "playable but far from perfect."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer has already outlined some of the updates players can expect following the game's launch, including bug fixes, mod support, and additional content. It's also working to improve the game's performance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For those curious whether Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon could be their next life-consuming RPG, a free demo is available on both Steam and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Almost two years ago, at the time of writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/">EA and Cliffhanger Games confirmed</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-open-world-game-rumor-ea-studio-shadow-of-morder-vets/">rumors</a> of a new Black Panther game coming from EA were true, and that the team at Cliffhanger was working on a new single-player, third-person action game with Black Panther as the main character.</p>
<p>Today, a new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN</a> revealed that EA has <strong>canceled</strong> its Black Panther game and shut down the studio working on it, Cliffhanger Games. It's the latest batch of layoffs from Electronic Arts after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off 300-400 developers last month</a> and canceled an incubation project at Respawn. It also recently announced that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">sunsetting its remote work policies</a> and moving to push employees back to working in the office.</p>
<p>According to the report, the layoffs extend to members of EA's mobile and central teams, but the company would not share exactly how many developers were impacted. In an email from Laura Miele, EA Entertainment president, she reportedly called the decision, and the other recent layoffs that EA has suffered, "<em>hard</em>" choices, but that they are choices being made to "<em>sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities.</em>"</p>
<p>Miele also wrote that the company is doing "<em>everything we can to support them, including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles</em>." She also continues to say that moving forward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">EA's Entertainment division</a> will focus on: The Sims, Skate, Battlefield, and Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Respawn will still work on the upcoming third installment in the Star Wars Jedi series, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-will-be-written-by-squirrel-girl-writer-ryan-north/">Iron Man game from Motive Studio</a> is still happening, though with this cancellation, it's worth not putting too much stock in Miele's reassurances about the Iron Man game, especially when considering what EA's chief executive officer, Andrew Wilson, said last year about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA moving away from games based on licensed IP</a>.</p>
<p>It's upsetting to see more developers lose their jobs, and an additional sad point with Cliffhanger Games's closure is that it's the latest part of the tragedy of Monolith Studios. Cliffhanger was founded by former Monolith developers who worked on the Shadow of Mordor games, and helped develop the nemesis system that players still rave about today. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith is gone</a>, and the studio founded by Monolith veterans is also gone.</p>

We expect strategies against this monster to be very similar, however, should specific Event Quests return.</p><h2 id="h118752"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is more intense than its weaker variants, the general faults are the same.

An important distinction is that bringing weapons with an ice element as well as armor with high thunder resistance is more of a requirement than a recommendation this time around. We’ll want to end this as soon as possible, especially with the beast’s abundant health and higher resistance to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276">wounds</a></span>.</p><p>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is also far more aggressive than its Tempered variant, attacking more frequently and stringing together many of its moves. It’s a common occurrence to be hit by one attack and then by another while trying to get up. Remember to call your Seikret for a quick pick-up before you get sent back to camp! Your Seikret is the perfect asset that shouldn’t be overlooked during intense hunts like these. Taking a break from the action to heal up is a lot better than doing so within Rey Dau’s proximity.</p><p>What might be the most notable difference is that many of this monster’s attacks will attract lightning strikes. These increase the likelihood of being stunned and make it more difficult to get some hits in. Hunters who enjoy using weapons with counterattacks will need to keep their guard up a bit longer. A successful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> works fine, but other counters will usually be interrupted and leave you defenseless for a more damaging attack. Bringing gear with the Evade Extender skill can be a big help for dodging the lightning as well.</p><p><strong>If you need a break from these aftershocks, destroying the blue Fulgurite crystals along its wings and tail will disable them for around three minutes.</strong> It’s not a permanent solution as the crystals will come back, and you’ll be dealing less damage by not focusing on the head, but this is an ideal tactic if you’re having trouble with these follow-ups.</p><p>Not counting the extra lightning, Arch-Tempered Rey Dau does come with a brand-new move. Standing too close can trigger it to shoot lightning directly beneath it. This is an important attack to be mindful of, since Rey Dau’s underside is a safe spot in previous hunts. Being hit by this will leave you open for a potential follow-up charged beam that can faint you. My advice is to dodge out of the way as soon as you notice it charging up and looking down. You’ll likely have a second at most to react.</p><p>Destroying tempered wounds is still a fantastic way to knock your target down. Coming at odds with this is Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s high wound resistance. Besides a weak spot that appears after performing its strongest charged beam, there aren’t many opportunities to land a focus strike and some nice damage. Knocking Rey Dau down will mostly require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, traps (pitfall and vine traps specifically), and the occasional Flash Pod when it’s flying in the air.</p><p>There isn’t much more to the fight than chasing after it to new locations. The electric wyvern is basically enraged the entire fight, so it’s purely a matter of survival. Always prioritize your health to best avoid any one-hit KOs. If you’ve been carted once or twice already, remember that capturing the monster is an option. No shame in finishing this hunt early.</p><h2 id="h118754"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Exclusive Rewards</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of the rewards and drops you receive will be the same as the Tempered version. <strong>The biggest difference for Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is that instead of receiving </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176"><strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong></a></span><strong>, you’ll receive the new Rey Dau Certificate Y material.</strong> This is needed to forge the new Rey Dau Gamma armor for your hunter and Palico, as well as upgrade to the new Defense Charm V and Power Charm III talismans.

                <p>Electronic Arts has confirmed it's cancelling its upcoming Black Panther game and closing its developer. Cliffhanger Games, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">only opened in 2023 to make the Black Panther game</a>, is now shuttered. EA previously signed a deal with Marvel for multiple games, and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">Iron Man title</a> is still coming.</p><p>EA boss Laura Miele said in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo obtained by IGN</a> that the company is cancelling the game and closing the studio to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502908" data-ratio="0.55793450881612" data-width="1588" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502908"></a><figcaption>EA's Black Panther game is not going forward.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4502908-eabp.jpg"></figure><p>Additionally, EA is laying off staff on its mobile and "central" teams, though the exact number of affected staff is unknown. This follows on from a previous round of layoffs in April that affected around 300 people and led to the reported <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">cancellation of a Titanfall game</a>.</p><p>"These decisions are hard," Miele said in a memo to staff. "They affect people we've worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them-- including finding opportunities within EA, where we've had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p>In 2024, EA laid off nearly 700 people and said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">wasn't sure how much more it would invest in licensed IP going forward</a>. Due to this commentary, some wondered if any of EA's Marvel projects would be affected. EA previously signed a multi-game deal with Marvel, and now, the only confirmed project from that partnership is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">new Iron Man game from Motive Studio.</a> When the deal was announced, EA said it covered <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-marvel-entertainment-multi-title-collaboration" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at least three games.</a></p><p>Cliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, who oversaw the production of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War at Monolith Productions. He joined EA in 2021. Other members of the team at Cliffhanger worked on Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty.</p><p>It is unknown how far along in development the Black Panther game was. When the game and the studio were announced in 2023, EA said the game was "still in early development with a long road ahead." EA and Cliffhanger were attempting to make what they said was a "definitive and authentic Black Panther experience."</p><p>Outside of EA's superhero games, Warner Bros. was making a Wonder Woman game based on the iconic DC character, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-wonder-woman-legend-was-working-on-canceled-game-offers-heartfelt-tribute/1100-6529718/" data-ref-id="1100-6529718">that game was also canceled.</a></p><p>Going forward, Miele said that EA would focus on Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends, while development will continue on Iron Man and the next Star Wars: Jedi game. EA's mobile game projects remain intact, while BioWare continues to make the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect</a> as well. And of course, EA's sports catalog will continue as well, including EA Sports FC, Madden, College Football, and NHL.</p><p>Despite all of EA's recent layoffs and closures, the company's headcount continues to grow. As of March 2025, EA had <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 800 additional people on staff</a> than it did the same time a year prior.</p><p>EA is making these dramatic cuts and closures as the company rakes in money. For the last three months alone, EA pulled in <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1.9 billion in revenue and made a profit of $254 million</a>. For the latest fiscal year, however, EA's revenue slid from $7.562 billion to $7.463 billion, with net profit falling from $1.273 billion to $1.121 billion. </p>
