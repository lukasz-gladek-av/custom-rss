            <p>Tiny deck builder Combo Critters exhibits the winning combination common to both small games and radical breakfast cereals - it’s very crunchy, but also bright, sugary and moreish. If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/27/kelloggs-ceo-cereal-for-dinner">Thaddius Cornflakes</a> had recommended struggling families play Combo Critters instead of eating Cookie Crisp for dinner, I imagine the backlash would have been far more reserved. Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> from <a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/combo-critters">Itch here</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Combo Critters is the latest from PUNKCAKE Délicieux, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shotgun-king-is-roguelike-chess-with-a-shotgun">Shotgun King</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-mathematical-tactics-rpg-is-like-the-countdown-numbers-round-with-added-violence">Super Algebrawl</a> fame. Each level, you form a team of six critters by drawing and discarding, then try to beat your opponent’s score. Each critter has a score, an alignment, and a special effect. Some critters play nice with each other, some don’t. I currently have an ice cream in my hand that adds fifteen to its score if paired with another critter called Cloud, but I also need at least one other ‘sugar’ type critter to score at all. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote>Welcome to Combo Critters, a unique strategy game where the smallest creatures pack the biggest punch! Build a team of tiny yet powerful critters, each with unique abilities and traits. Maximize their interactions and synergies to achieve the highest possible score and outwit your opponents.</blockquote>
<p>Also, get this: It’s not a bloody roguelike. You get to a NEW stage and if you FAIL the stage you just START that stage over and TRY AGAIN. Is this legal, I ask?</p>
<p>I do have to whine briefly though: Combo Critters refuses to explain itself whatsoever, including what certain status effects and other terms mean. This feels like such an obvious oversight that I’m wondering if it’s a deliberate choice - the proverbial dump in the cereal. Perhaps it’s a ploy to command your full attention and teach you an important lesson - for how many people do we look at, but never really see? A lesson on empathy? Pretty rich coming from the bastards who couldn’t even empathise with my need for a tutorial, that. Anyway - cool game, lovely soundtrack, very free. Enjoy!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a week since the free-to-play Unreal Engine 4-powered MMORPG Throne and Liberty launched globally on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and publisher Amazon Games has now shared the first promising figures on player numbers. According to Amazon, over three million players have ventured into the world of Solisium during the first seven days of availability. Altogether, they have spent more than 24 million hours in the game, an average of eight each. The game fared well on Twitch, too, with more than 11 million hours watched on the streaming platform.</p>
<p>Christoph Hartmann, VP at Amazon Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Bringing Throne and Liberty to players around the world has been a huge shared undertaking by our team and our friends at NCSOFT, and we’re so pleased to see the results as players join the game. We’re only getting started, and we have a series of updates planned including our first castle siege coming soon.</em></p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-pre-launch-qa-new-weapons-and-pvp-modes-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Daniel Lafuente (Globalization Design Manager at Amazon Games), who teased some of the upcoming updates for the MMORPG. According to the official roadmap, November will see the first major guild events in the form of the first Tax Delivery Event and Castle Sieges. Amazon Games is also planning to launch Arena Season 1 for the 3v3 mode and possibly the two-star co-op dungeons as well.</p>
<p>The Korean version of Throne and Liberty already saw the introduction of a whole new mountainous region called Talandre, where players can even exploit water currents to get an advantage during conquest battles. In Talandre, players will find four new field bosses and two new arch-bosses to defeat. There are also new systems called Runes and Trait Resonance. All of these things will be added in due time to the global version.</p>
<p>Amazon Games isn't new to big launches, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-had-over-1-million-players-on-day-one-character-transfers-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-had-over-4-7-million-players-says-amazon-who-wants-to-be-the-most-customer-obsessed-company-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Ark</a> both setting records right away. However, both games saw massive reductions in the respective player bases over time, especially New World. Still, the latter game largely suffered because of a lack of content, and this likely won't be an issue with Throne and Liberty, as noted above.</p>

			<p>Kalypso Media and Claymore Game Studios announced the release of a demo for the upcoming real-time tactics game <a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-gets-new-trailer-ahead-of-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commandos: Origins</a>. The demo is available only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3137720/Commandos_Origins__Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/commandos-origins-demo/9nq8p31k009d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>, although the full game is also launching on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>In this test mission, players will step into the iconic boots of the Green Beret and Marine and be immersed in the heart of tactical warfare. They have to sabotage a cutting-edge German radar system responsible for a shocking surge in RAF casualties. The Green Beret is adept with both his combat knife and his Colt M1911. However, sometimes, it's just more effective to use a sound decoy to distract the soldiers and slip past unnoticed. The Marine, on the other hand, uses his throwing knives with deadly precision and is an expert at throwing a simple rock to distract guards.</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the Channel Islands during World War II, the Commandos will use their unique skills to sabotage a German radar system, showcasing the exciting gameplay that Commandos: Origins promises.&nbsp;This demo-exclusive test mission, Operation: Prelude, is a sneak peek at the intricate gameplay mechanics and stealth tactics that await players in the full release.</p>
<p>The full game will include fourteen missions set in authentic World War II environments, ranging from the barren Arctic to the African desert. Players will be able to select six Commandos: Jack O’Hara “the Green Beret”, Thomas “the Sapper” Hancock, Francis T. “the Sniper” Woolridge, Samuel “the Driver” Brooklyn, James “the Marine” Blackwood, and Rene “the Spy” Duchamp.</p>
<p>Commandos: Origins is still scheduled to launch in 2024, even though there's only a couple and a half months left before the end of the year. It will be added to Game Pass PC and console on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-new-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rejoice, Fallout fans – there’s a new trailer for Fallout: Nuevo México, and it comes months after concerns surfaced that the project was going to be cancelled. In the latest trailer, which is a meaty three minutes long, we get a new look at the game-sized mod that promises to breathe a fresh lease of life into Fallout: New Vegas.</p>



<p>It’s potentially more ambitious than Fallout: London, which was released recently on the Fallout 4 platform. Building Fallout: Nuevo México in Fallout: New Vegas’ engine has proven to be a trifle tougher than manipulating the tools available in Fallout 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-viva-mexico">Viva México</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, concerns surfaced regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of Nuevo México</a>, a game-sized Fallout: New Vegas mod with huge potential. It was announced that the project was on an ‘indefinite hold’ following the departure of Zapshock, the mod’s lead developer. It came mere weeks after the indefinite cancellation of Fallout: London, a similarly ambitious mod for Fallout 4.</p>



<p>However, Fallout: London would go on to be released weeks later, while Fallout: Nuevo México has been shrouded in silence for months.</p>



<p>This latest trailer helps to dispel fears that it’ll never make it to the market:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout: México - Official Reveal Trailer | 🇲🇽" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoh5HxjV81M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Per the mod’s synopsis on YouTube:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mexico City is the largest city in North America and serves as the biggest hub in Fallout: Nuevo México. While still largely under development, we are thrilled to finally reveal this iconic wasteland. </p>



<p>Once the vibrant heart of a massive metropolis, Mexico City now lies in ruin, a battleground for factions struggling for dominance and survival. From the decaying colonia of Chapultepec to the submerged canals of Xochimilco, the city is a haunting blend of beauty and brutality.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The update doesn’t mention the recent hold, nor does it address the radio silence that has been in place for the last few months. It’s just solid news that the mod is moving forward once again, and not only that but it looks brilliant on-screen.</p>

<p>In 2018, Detroit: Become Human hit the market and delivered an emotional, heart-wrenching experience to fans worldwide. As one of the best ‘choice-and-consequence’ games out there,e Detroit: Become Human puts players in control of several characters, all of whom can ultimately become intertwined through a dramatic and immersive story.</p>



<p>It was remarkably well received, and to this day, people are still raving about it. Recently, the team at Quantic Dream revealed that the game has officially hit 10 million (paid) copies sold across PlayStation and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-a-little-while-longer">Just a Little While Longer</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human offers one of the most engaging stories you’ll ever play. From the perspective of several characters, you’ll embark on an intense journey that details the uprising of ‘synths’ or ‘androids’ against human oppressors and masters. </p>



<p>Whether you’re playing as Kara, a protective housekeeper, or Connor, a conflicted investigator who must align closely with human law enforcement officers, you’ll be exploring multiple angles of a story where one wrong choice could mean the irrevocable death of a character.</p>



<p>Think Beyond Two Souls or Heavy Rain but in a universe that could one day be our reality.</p>



<p>In a recent post on X, Guillaume de Fondaumière, the CEO of Quantic Dream, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The entire Quantic Dream team is joining me to proudly announce that (Detroit: Become Human) has now sold in excess of 10 million (paid) units on PlayStation and PC. </p>



<p>We are extremely grateful to each and everyone out there who played the game. You mean the world to us and we couldn’t have achieved this incredible milestone without every single one of you!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Around the time that Detroit: Become Human was released, Quantic Dream came under fire for allegedly fostering a toxic working environment, which forced a reform at the studio. Despite that, fans were – and still are – hungry for a follow-up title to Detroit: Become Human, which would perfectly translate into a live-action adaptation at any time.</p>

<p>It’s almost time to dive into one of the most highly anticipated Call of Duty titles in years. On October 25, Black Ops 6 will be released worldwide, marking the arrival of a game that expands a story that was kicked off way back in 2010. It’s a game that makes history in a couple of ways, but on a more basic level, it’s a solid shooter with an intriguing story.</p>



<p>That concept was explored in the most recent Black Ops 6 trailer published by Activision.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-still-lies">The Truth (Still) Lies</h2>



<p>The one-minute trailer released by Activision gives us another glimpse at the story that awaits us in Black Ops 6. It’s the most conspiracy-laden and controversial campaign created in Black Ops history, playing with stories that massively impacted our own world over the last few decades.</p>



<p>Check out the latest Black Ops 6 gameplay trailer here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0uxvKUjsj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s a mixed bag, that’s for sure. We’re seeing scenes of subterfuge and sabotage mixed in with guns-blazing, high-octane action. From dream sequences to blasting out bridges from the gunner seat of a chopper, Black Ops 6 looks like it’ll offer one of the most diverse and intriguing stories in years.</p>



<p>Speaking subjectively, the Black Ops 6 has always done better regarding the story element of the Call of Duty series. Modern Warfare’s reboot failed to captivate audiences since 2019, and the most recent release, Modern Warfare 3, boasted an unforgettable campaign that could be completed in just two or three hours if you rushed.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is the first Call of Duty game in history to be available on Game Pass at launch, so you can invest in this year’s title without parting ways with a penny.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred’s release is delayed no more. As of October 8, 12:18 AM ET, the expansion is available for all players.</p>



<p>“QA verification complete,” Blizzard’s Adam Fletcher said. “Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is NOW LIVE across all platforms!”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/theadvnt/status/1843499732288827811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those on social media</a>, the update came in at <a href="https://x.com/Johay90/status/1843500911248679092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">around 40GB</a>, even for those who predownloaded.</p>



<p><em>Update 1 and Original story is below…</em></p>



<hr>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred remains delayed, but a release could finally be happening soon.</p>



<p>“The new update is nearly finished uploading to our servers,” Blizzard’s Adam Fletcher posted at 11:30pm ET. “We will be giving the greenlight once the update is finished and available for PC [Battle.net] users to download.</p>



<p>“During this time, we will be running last minute QA verifications before we turn things on.”</p>



<p>The update was originally scheduled to release at 7pm ET but has been delayed due to technical issues “on the back end”. </p>



<p><em>Original story is below…</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Diablo 4’s Vessel of Hatred’s launch has been delayed. The expansion was scheduled to launch at 7pm ET on Monday, October 7, but didn’t happen for players.</p>



<p>Around 5:30pm ET, Diablo 4 global director of community Adam Fletcher <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/adjustment-and-delay-to-vessel-of-hatred-launch-start-time/191713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted online</a> that Blizzard was looking at a “small delay” for the launch. At the time, he said that the developers were “tackling a small issue on the back end” but they still expected it to launch Monday evening.</p>



<p>As time passed by, the update still hadn’t released, though players were being removed from the game and logins were being locked around 7pm ET. This was to prepare for the deployment of Vessel of Hatred. However, it still wasn’t released.</p>



<p>The latest update came around 9:30pm ET</p>



<p>“[I]t looks like it will be about upwards of two hours until we launch Vessel of Hatred,” Fletcher said. “Additionally Battle.net players will need an additional sizable update before playing.</p>



<p>“We will let you know when this update is available. We apologize for the delay and look forward to seeing you in Nahantu soon.”</p>



<p>For what was hoped to be just a “<a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1843407297634283968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">couple hours at most</a>” has turned into several for fans who have been patiently waiting for the release. As of publishing at 11pm ET, the update still wasn’t available to download.</p>

<p>In the world of Valorant, popular pro player, Bang (bangzerra) has officially joined Sentinels, the massive esports organization. The news of the 20-year-old Valorant pro’s signing comes just days after he officially left 100 Thieve’s Valorant team.</p>



<h2 id="h-bang-joins-sentinels-s-valorant-team">Bang Joins Sentinels’s Valorant Team</h2>



<p>With the VCT in its off-season, many teams are acquiring new players, trying to prepare for the 2025 season. Sentinels are no different. </p>



<p>After coming in second in the Red Bull Home Ground North American Qualifier, the team has officially signed Bang. The player not only played on 100 Thieves but was at one point a player for TSM, making him quite the decorated Valorant competitor.</p>



<p>While having played for various big esports teams, Bang has never actually won a Valorant Champions. The player, however, seems to be quite determined with his new start at Sentinels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“I’m ready to f**king win,” said Bang in Sentinels’s announcement video. In fact, these were the only words the player expressed, showing that his drive is focused solely on being the best.</p>







<h2 id="h-bang-leaves-100-thieves-just-days-ago">Bang Leaves 100 Thieves Just Days Ago</h2>



<p>The competitor left 100 Thieves’s Valorant team just a few days ago, making his signing to Sentinels an extremely fast turnaround. </p>



<p>“Hardest decision of my career,” said Bang on Twitter when announcing he was leaving 100 Thieves. “I know this makes some people happy and some people sad. I wish I helped 100T win more, but in the end, I’m proud of what we accomplished.”</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Bang’s words resonated with 100 Thieves fans, and fans of his own. It will be exciting to see what this new chapter brings for the competitor as we approach the end of the year, heading into the 2025 VCT season.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion.1003320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> somehow expertly combines open-world exploration and coziness with a fashion-forward story that both new players and Nikki veterans are sure to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a chance to check out the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> closed private preview, and as a longtime <em>Love Nikki</em> enthusiast, I had very high hopes. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/infinity-nikki"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a> exceeded these expectations, crafting a stunning open-world game with incredibly fun exploration and gorgeous aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/early-infinity-nikki-cutscene.jpg?itok=f48VqLFF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/early-infinity-nikki-cutscene.jpg?itok=IlBy-uP6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>starts off with incredibly powerful and beautiful scenes.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Opening Story&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> starts with Nikki her longtime pet pal Momo exploring Nikki’s attic. There, they find a few dresses that belonged to Nikki’s mother. One teleports them to Miraland, where Nikki is tasked with crafting Miracle Outfits to save a mysterious woman named Ena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along the way, Nikki meets an incredible cast of characters that are both gorgeous visually and have well-done voice acting. The story itself is interesting, but it’s nothing that stands out compared to other live-action open-world titles. However, it sets the stage to let the characters and aesthetics shine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riding-a-bike-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=3DqS1Cd- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riding-a-bike-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=WrkR8wAf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are plenty of ways to get around the stunning world of&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Shining Open World with Plenty to Do</h2>
<p>The world contains a plethora of things to do, including fishing, crafting, minigames, and even grooming animals. These smaller things are ways to relax in Miraland while crafting different outfit pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These outfits are used for both aesthetic purposes while exploring and for competitions that are reminiscent of other <em>Nikki </em>games. There are groups that players can find and challenge, and these challenges are putting together an outfit that fits certain criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grooming-cat-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=mCm9uDkX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grooming-cat-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=gv-JH--n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grooming animals in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is adorable, and the animals themselves are absolutely precious.</figcaption></figure><p>While exploring the open world, players can find Whimstars, which are used to craft Miracle Outfits that unlock special abilities. These are generally found through light platforming, which is actually intuitive and feels good to play. There’s also some combat, but it’s just clicking the mouse while aiming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hesitant about how this would feel in a <em>Nikki </em>title, but I was impressed. I’m generally not someone who explores much even in open-world games like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, but I found exploring satisfying in a way not many other games hit for me.</p>
<p>The world is packed to the brim with things to explore in the early area, meaning there’s plenty of content when players are done with the story or trying to level up.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Beautiful and Bone-Chilling Aesthetics and Outfits</h2>

The sights are breathtaking, and even the music gave me cold chills at one point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, fashion contributes to this. Each item of clothing, from three-star items to five-star items, is more detailed than I’ve ever seen in a video game. Each item has been crafted with love, and there are endless outfit combinations to make with each unique piece.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outfits-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=fLgykK75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outfits-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=yUEb7_5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of the first outfits I created in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, combining low and high rarity items.</figcaption></figure><p>The Miracle Outfits are all able to be broken down into components and used to create stunning outfits. Players can also craft outfit pieces and use the resonate-gacha system to get more pieces as well.</p>
<p>While some might scoff at the gacha aspect, it’s one that <em>Nikki </em>games generally do well. There are a lot of great items to pull, and the opportunity for free pulls exists at every corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had so much fun creating outfits, and Nikki looked stunning in them all. Running around the overworld with several different outfits honestly contributed to how great the exploration felt. There’s something special about in-depth character creations that can change how a game plays for me, and <em>Infinity Nikki</em> absolutely nailed it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Players of all Levels can Join In</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/boss-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=pKLN9PdU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/boss-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=iAag-Wvr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The boss designs were incredible and fit the world of <em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>well.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this was to be expected – it’s what the <em>Nikki </em>series is about. And the game knows its audience well. For those who may not have played an open-world game, the tutorial at the beginning is incredibly detailed. So much so that players who are accustomed to open-world mechanics might think it’s overkill.</p>
<p>However, the in-depth tutorial makes the open-world game feel less daunting for those who are coming to the series as mobile <em>Nikki </em>players.</p>
<p>Considering <em>Nikki </em>has only ever been a mobile game prior to <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it’s very likely that some players haven’t played an open-world game at all. Developers accounted for this very well, and I was impressed because it’s often an area in games that’s looked over.</p>
<h2>Infinity Nikki Preview Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/adorable-dragon-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=sTLPEEfZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/adorable-dragon-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=x_CtPQnX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>were lovely.</figcaption></figure><p>All in all, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> knocks every other mobile open-world game out of the park. With fun, simple mechanics, and absolutely stunning aesthetics, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is perfect for anyone with a passion for fashion. In fact, any open-world game lover should try it out. There are so many things it does right that it’s a fun play even outside the outfits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Nikki&nbsp;</em>games also historically have great PvP content and events that reward stunning outfits. There were no events going on for the closed beta of course, but the potential of these in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has me very hopeful that it will become an everyday, staple game in my rotation.</p>

It's an achievement that was thought to be impossible until techniques like rolling and hypertapping came into play, inspiring a new generation of Tetris pioneers.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">35 years after its release, <a href="https://twitter.com/dogplayingtris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dogplayingtris</a> just became the first person to get the NES Tetris rebirth. He made it all the way to level 255, then the game wrapped around and restarted from level 0. <a href="https://t.co/Igwa2fIrmJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Igwa2fIrmJ</a></p>— SummoningSalt (@summoningsalt) <a href="https://twitter.com/summoningsalt/status/1842762608627331278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Notably, Artiaga was playing on a special version of the Tetris NES rom that keeps it from crashing after passing level 155. Earlier this year, Tetris expert and fellow teen Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson managed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/impossible-tetris-nes-beaten-for-the-first-time-in-34-years-by-13-year-old-phenom">beat Tetris for the first time</a> by hitting one of these crashes on level 157, marking the first ever instance of a human player getting one over on Alexey Pajitnov's classic. After level 157, the crash points continue to proliferate, making them virtually impossible to avoid.</p><p>Still, that doesn't make Artiaga's feat any less impressive. As Ars Technica notes, the NES version of Tetris actually has a glitch in level 235 that results in it taking an incredible 810 lines to clear — an eternity when you're playing at the fastest possible rate. Artiaga spent 20 minutes on this level alone, finally proclaiming that he had "seen the light" when it was finished.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Top 100 Games of All Time (2021 Update)</h3></div></output><p>Artiaga went on to clear level 255 and finally pull off the "rebirth," sending the game all the way back to level 0. Then, incredibly, he kept right on playing, continuing all the way to level 91 before finally giving up. His final score was 29,486,164, breaking the previous world record by Alex Thach by more than 12 million points.</p><p>"Oh my god, I'm so glad that game is over, bro," Artiaga said. "I never want to play this game again, bro... I was starting to lose my mind."</p><p>Fans hailed Artiaga's accomplishment online, not just because he pulled off a world first rebirth, but because he proved that endless play was indeed possible. Now speculation has already begun on who might pull off the first "double rebirth." If records keep falling at the pace that they have been, it shouldn't be long. After all, it's been less than a year since <a href="https://x.com/kobunheat/status/1839852964477055100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Scuti beat Tetris, and he's now crashing it for fun</a>. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/epic-games-disney-fortnite-mickey-mouse-gun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic is talking a big game about its ever-shifting vision of the metaverse again, and as usual, it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-epic-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly word salad</a> presumably meant to whet investors’ appetites. But one detail in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Verge interview</a> with Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson about the company’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-fortnite-d23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion partnership with Disney</a> stood out to me. Specifically, this one:</p><blockquote><p>But the partnership doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to run around the <em>Fortnite </em>battle royale island as Mickey Mouse with a gun. “Not every outfit will be able to do everything,” Persson says. “A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.”&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>For the moment, this is a presumption on The Verge’s part – not a statement of fact from Epic or Disney. Still, it certainly sounds plausible given the conditions Epic has laid out: Epic and Disney will offer separate “front doors” into the same interconnected, Epic-powered universe where different characters will play by different rules depending on family friendliness. “Some IPs are not teen IPs or mature IPs,” Persson told The Verge. “They are E for everyone IPs.”</p><p>This corporation-controlled, hyper-sanitized vision of the future is pretty par for the course as far as these things go, but I will nonetheless balk at one element of it: Mickey Mouse, specifically, <em>should </em>be allowed to wield a gun. The case for, as far as I’m concerned, is stronger than the case against. To begin, Epic has already put guns in the hands of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?type=outfit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous characters</a> who’d never otherwise be caught dead – or in this case, killing – with them.&nbsp;</p><p>These include Aang from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, who spent his series’ entire final arc searching for a way to avoid killing its biggest villain, and Spider-Man, who generally refuses to kill people, as well as Disney mainstays who feel, at best, out of character firing a gun, like Jack Skellington from <em>A Nightmare Before Christmas</em> and, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3551687/now-officially-official-disney-owns-alien-predator-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technically</a>, the Xenomorph from <em>Alien</em>, who simply does not need a gun. It’s also weird to see Naruto and his friends gun down all who oppose them, though I will acknowledge that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/y5oxhk/references_to_guns_in_naruto_despite_guns_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns exist in the <em>Naruto </em>universe</a> despite rarely being seen outside early episodes.</p><p>More importantly, Mickey Mouse has held a gun in his iconic gloved hands on multiple occasions. For example, there’s <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Two-Gun_Mickey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Two-Gun Mickey,”</a> a 1934 cartoon in which both Mickey and Minnie use guns for their intended purpose: Wild West rootin’, tootin’, and shootin’. There’s also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrBvxHI5wFc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 1938 cartoon called “Mickey’s Parrot”</a> in which Mickey grabs a shotgun to fend off what he perceives to be a home invader (it’s actually a parrot). Much more recently, there is a level in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522160/Disney_Epic_Mickey_Rebrushed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently-remastered</a> 2010 video game <em>Epic Mickey</em> – literally a combination of the words “Epic” and “Mickey,” though not developed by Epic Games – called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNXwsbnzpAc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Great Guns</a>” that’s set during World War I and sees Mickey platform his way through streams of gun- and cannon-fire. Relatedly, Mickey Mouse also <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/BQXhuqy5geSMLA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on real-life World War II war bonds</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be noted that I am not personally a fan of <a href="https://kotaku.com/real-guns-virtual-guns-and-me-1824159338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns</a> or the extent to which they permeate culture in the United States. Nonetheless, when it comes to nauseatingly corporate fictional settings, I believe in two things: fairness and unintentional comedy. If you’re going to force my sweet boy Goku – who refused to kill even Frieza, a confirmed genocider – to wave around cold, unfeeling steel instead of the beautiful and pure life energy of the Spirit Bomb, then Mickey deserves the same treatment. Anything less would be an insult to his legacy of sporadically packing heat. Let Mickey Mouse have a gun. It’s the right thing to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/talking-death-roll-show-camp-rend-horror-and-indie-production-with-frankie-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Death Roll Show is a new indie TTRPG Actual Play with a focus on taking different horror styles and adapting them into short anthology adventures. On October 11th the first season of Death Roll Show: Camp Rend will be released. To talk about Camp Rend, indie TTRPG creations, and how to get your own start in the space I sat down with the Creator, Executive Producer, and DM for Camp Rend, Frankie Nicks, as well as Producer and performer, KP.</p>
<p>As always I like to start at the beginning so I asked Nicks how the premise for Death Roll Show originated. Nicks explained that a friend of his owns a production company that focuses on creating "B-movie horror type special effects and gore" Nicks explained that he's been attempting to get his friend to do a project with him but "he just has never been interested. He's not big into TTRPG or <em>D&amp;D</em>. I think he played a couple of times in High School when I dragged him along. Every time I pitched it he didn't get it, I ended up finally getting him to watch <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">Dropout </a>enough to where he got interested and he really appreciated how Dropout as a company was structured with lots of employee involvement and profit sharing and so then I was able to show him Dimension 20, show him how successful those things were so to get the company involved I pitched 'we could do something horror related'"</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//_1SkLBNVn5Y"></iframe></p>
<p>Nicks explained that he had always had a love of horror growing up "Obviously <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15ae2b87-cf24-463c-b903-4dadaf6c28ea" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/friday-13th-horror-at-camp-crystal-lake-review"><em>Friday the 13th</em></a> and all that stuff, but I was more into the weird kinda stuff like catseye that always had little stories. That's where I got the anthology idea because I also wanted to pitch it in a way that would be smart commercially." Nicks rallied off the benefits of keeping it small in the TTRPG space, it would need just a single location, minimal set work, and they could shoot all four episodes in a day.</p>
<p>Camp Rend is a slasher season that will focus on a group of campers and their camp counselors as if something is attacking them. Referencing back to his last answer about creating something easily definable Nicks explained "we chose this genre specifically because not only a love for everything of the 80s and the past, but being on a short budget we could use a VHS filter in editing to hide production"</p>
<p>Nicks took me behind the production curtain a bit explaining that there was a lot of planning that went into making sure they could create as high a production end product knowing that they didn't have the budget to have 6 Production Assistants on hand-checking every single shot.</p>
<p>As I heard from both Nicks and KP it was clear to see not just how much passion they had for the project, but also how much respect they had for all of the work each other and the entire production crew and cast had put into creating Camp Rend. Each was constantly trying to follow up from the other making corrections to ensure each got the credit they were due.</p>

<p>Nicks also spoke about his aspirations for what a second season and beyond would look like. Writing for Camp Rend began only six month ago, knowing that these productions can be small and turned around on a tight schedule.</p>
<p>"What I'm glad about the team is we're all very positive and looking toward the horizon in what we want to do. We have ideas for a Sci-Fi one, a very cult-like/witchy vibe one almost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e47e5379-5686-451a-9164-1641ecae29eb" href="https://techraptor.net/games/blair-witch"><em>Blair Witch Project</em></a> style." KP explained to me "Not only in terms of storyline wise but also in terms of how can it be manifested on-screen in a unique way."</p>
<p>KP teased that they already have three or four ideas for ways they could introduce interesting mechanics, such as the Jenga Block tower, to other settings to create distinct experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Camp Rend Is A Unique <em>D&amp;D</em>-Hybrid Experience</h2>
<p>Camp Rend uses <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> as its base, each of the characters are built to level 5 using the<em> D&amp;D</em> rules, but there's an added twist that the Jenga Block tower system from <em>Dread </em>is implemented to assist with ever-increasing stakes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-roll-show-campground-scene.jpg?itok=gFSfZwsD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-roll-show-campground-scene.jpg?itok=R309uR9g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"The biggest [mechanic] you can see from our trailer is using the Jenga Tower" KP explained "Using that as a system to elevate the stress and impact of decisions that are being made. D&amp;D and all of these games players are typically very powerful and it's very easy to lose that sense of dread. We wanted to bring that back into the show and ensure that as players and characters we felt the fear that came from being in the situation."</p>
<p>Nicks explained "I was trying to find a way to increase the stakes. I tried a couple of different things first, I tried some test games borrowing adversity tokens from Kids on Bikes, trying an anti-adversity system, I workshopped a system with a skill game with a bar but I kept coming back to the tower."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's perfect because it's a little bit of skill involved but there is a rule that if you touch it you take it, so no tippy tappies"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A look of disbelief and shellshock came over KPs face as this rule was disclosed. He reinforced that the consequences were very real in the game and it's not something that any rules in D&amp;D can save you from.</p>
<p>KP and Nicks started to reference a moment from the trailer as KP pulled a block. KP highlighted how real the feeling of success was for him in that moment. Nicks added laughing that that was the moment he thought "Ok, we might have something here. That was the proof of concept. I wanted to find a way to bring up the tension but as more blocks are pulled you know it's going to be harder."</p>

<p>On top of the Jenga Tower another unique aspect to appeal to the audience is the live battle damage that will occur to the players as they get in danger.</p>
<p>Colin Fleetwood, the director, got the kudos for coming up with the idea of adding blood, but Nicks explained it was something they stumbled into. "When Colin accepted a deal and we got to talking production details it came about because he didn't understand the medium completely."</p>
<p>Nicks described miscommunications on the need for a set, Fleetwood believing it would take all of their budget before Nicks explained it just needed to be a static space with a table "like a play".</p>
<p>"When I was trying to explain that if I beat his armor class I could cut him and he said 'do they get damaged?' and I explained yeah they might have a gash and he said 'so we'll do the makeup for that?'" Through conversation they were able to figure out that blood could be set up in 5-30 minutes</p>
<p>Nicks joked that he hadn't seen anything like that in AP before, a progression of battle damage, and right as they were filming Dimension 20's latest season <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> had DM Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> get bloodier with each episode.</p>

<p>KP took some time to introduce me to his character for Camp Rend, Camp Councelor Virin. "He is all about the camp, this is probably his second or third year working at Camp Rend. He comes from a local druid circle in the nearby forest and he does not like it. He hates the idea of being stuck in the past and being all nature-esce:</p>
<p>We shared laughs as both of our thoughts turned to the idea that Virin was a druid on the equivalent of his rumspringa.</p>
<p>KP expressed his love for being part of Death Role Show not only as a player, but that it was a production that made him feel like it was something he helped create. "When I was on the show and I got to experienc ethe story and the production I personally felt in that moment no one else is doing something like this, it's very cool and I'm imagining how we can take this to the next level. As someone who came from a Project Management background I know how I can help, what is a Producer but a Product Manager for the media world."</p>
<p>From there KP was able to get involved in creating pitch decks, crafting a media kit, and took over the reigns of the social media for Death Roll Show. The key of it all is that KP expressed his desire to make sure Death Roll Show could be a complete success.</p>

<p>Knowing that Nicks and KP had taken the first of many difficult steps into the realm of Actual Plays, playing on different tables and now producing their own shows I wondered what tips could be offered to those who might be hesitant to take their first steps.</p>
<p>For Nicks he was able to immediately offer what might be simple advice to hear, but to put in practice is much harder. "Keep trying, don't give up. I know that sounds lame but when I first started auditioning I had a very bad experience. It soured me on it and I almost left. You're going to have bad experiences, we know in this world there are gatekeepers and bad actors but a run in with one of those can sour you. Just work through that at your own pace and if you can get to the other side of it there are amazing people you'll get to meet."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Think big, if you have an idea and you think it's good then think big"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KPs advice came from a bit of a stranger place, an adult film director, who said "Everyone is fuckable" After pausing to laugh for a moment KP took the time to explain what he meant. "There's someone out there that will look at you and think 'I will smash that' and for any idea that you have there is someone out there that will see it and say 'I want to smash that idea.'"</p>

You have to remember even if you have ten people who watch your show you have to remember what ten people in a room looks like. When you see a number that looks like 100, compared to others that might seem small but you've got to imagine 100 people watching you perform. I feel like we're losing our perspective on how big that is."</p>
<h2>Short And Sweet Story</h2>
<p>Death Roll Show's first season, Camp Rend will start airing on the 10th of October and will air for the next four Thursdays concluding on Halloween night. KP did make a joke about how there is another Actual Play that airs on Thursdays that "a lot of people tend to be Critical about" but reinforced the idea that their episodes aren't just airing earlier but will each be in the 45-60 minute range making it easier to digest.</p>

            <p>
Pathologic, the acclaimed plague-themed horror series from developer Ice-Pick Lodge, is returning for a third instalment, this time slinging time travel into its gruelling, emotionally draining mix of intentionally dispiriting survival and haunting theatrics.
</p>
<p>
The newly announced Pathologic 3 is something of an oddity in that it's technically, sort of, the second chunk of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> - itself a half sequel and half (much-improved) remake of Ice-Pick Lodge's cult-classic 2005 original. Pathological 1 - which, as with all entries in the series, charts the sudden decline of a strange, small town on the edge of the Russian Steppe as it slowly succumbs to a mysterious plague - memorably had three playable characters and three distinct routes through its 12 days of increasing misery: that of Artemy Burakh (the Haruspex), Daniil Dankovsky (the Batchelor), and Clara (the Changeling).
</p>
<p>
Due to financial concerns, however, only the Haruspex path made it into Pathologic 2, and while Dankovsky did appear as the protagonist in a short standalone episode, titled The Marble Nest, his full path will now be the focus of Pathologic 3 - albeit significantly expanded.
</p>

<p>
Dankovsky is a young doctor and expert in thanatology who travels to Pathologic's mysterious town at the start of the outbreak in order to advance his research on death. As with the Haruspex's path, Dankovsky has 12 days to stop the plague, using all the tools of his medical trade. He can, explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">Pathologic 3's Steam page</a>, examine potions and diagnose diseases, cross-check symptoms and prescribe treatments, impose quarantines and curfews, confiscate medicine, vaccinate the population, deploy patrols, and more. 
</p><p>
Crucially, though, Dankovsky now also wields the power of time, and can travel forward to witness the future, or go backward to correct mistakes of the past. "Anything you see can tell a story and become a piece of your mental map of the world," explains Ice-Pick. "Explore the town for new insights, notice details, and connect the dots. Uncover the secrets of the town's inhabitants. Shape their stories, decide their fates, and talk to their shadows."
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything we know about Pathologic 3 right now, but  the current plans is to release it for PC some time next year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can%E2%80%99t-afford-to-ignore-these-tasks-before-diving-into-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred.1003206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The first major expansion for Diablo 4 is finally upon us, with a brand-new class—Spiritborne—a new zone to explore, unique gameplay mechanics, and major reworks and overhauls for core gameplay systems that totally revamp how you play Diablo 4. It’s a lot to ingest, and it’s easy for new and returning players to feel overwhelmed. Well, to help you out, we’ve compiled a few of the things you should do before Vessel of Hatred!</p>



<h2 id="h-change-campaigns">Change Campaigns</h2>



<p>After purchasing and downloading Vessel of Hatred, upon release, you’ll want to start a brand-new character to dive into the expansion and subsequent season. However, the game doesn’t jump straight into the new content. You need to tell it where to go.</p>



<p>At the end of character creation, you can ‘Change Campaign State’ to ‘Start with the Vessel of Hatred Campaign,’ and you absolutely should choose this option. Otherwise, you’ll start either in Kyovashad once again, like every other prior season, or you’ll begin the main Diablo 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-campaign-diablo-4-before-new-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story mode from the beginning</a>. Well, you’ll still start in Kyovashad, but there’s a quest in the main city to kickoff the new expansion.</p>



<h2 id="h-acquire-renown-and-altars-of-lilith">Acquire Renown and Altars of Lilith</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll want to run through Sanctuary acquiring every single Altar of Lilith and increasing your Renown within each zone. Every Altar provides a unique buff, usually additional stat bonuses, like Dexterity or Strength, along with the occasional Murmuring Obol capacity increase or an extra Paragon Point. They’re worthwhile, as starting a new character with all of the Altars provides you a significant power buff straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Renown allows you to claim bonus XP, gold, skill points, additional Potion Capacity, Max Obols, and Paragon Points from the Region Progress hub, which is, once again, a nice power buff for a new character!</p>



<h2 id="h-focus-on-mercenaries">Focus on Mercenaries</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p>After starting a new character and venturing from Kyovashad to Nahantu, the blacksmith Rahair will introduce you to the new Mercenary mechanics, which allow you to bring an NPC companion along with you. They’re immensely useful when you want to play solo and clear content quickly. Oh, and a second one will occasionally pop up to deal damage before disappearing into the night.</p>



<p>But first and foremost, before you get too excited and leap headfirst into the Vessel of Hatred campaign, complete the Mercenary missions to increase your rapport with each new character. The unique abilities each Mercenary unlocks with Rapport XP really does make a difference in the new content.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-about-vessel-of-hatred">What You Need to Know About Vessel of Hatred</h2>



<p>Before diving into all of the new content available in Diablo 4, there’s a few things you should know beforehand, as a lot of key changes come to the game alongside the new expansion, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>This first expansion includes a level squish, bringing the max player level down from 100 to 60.</li>



<li>The World Tier difficulty system is completely revamped and now includes Torment-like tiers instead of World Tier I-IV.</li>



<li>The max Paragon level is now 300.</li>



<li>Everyone receives two new character slots.</li>



<li>Every class receives additional Skills and Passives</li>



<li>Party Finder is finally in the game for group content.</li>



<li>Seasonal content and rewards</li>
</ul>



<p>Specifically to those who purchase the expansion, you will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nahantu</li>



<li>Spiritborne</li>



<li>Vessel of Hatred campaign</li>



<li>Runewords</li>



<li>Dark Citadel</li>



<li>Mercenaries</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>



<li>Vessel of Hatres-specific resource trading mechanics</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Did you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-has-made-over-1-billion-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 made over $1 billion in revenue</a>? It’s a positively staggering amount but not surprising in the least bit considering the cost of cosmetics available in the in-game store!</p>

Even if you’ve never watched the iconic anime, you’ve probably heard Harris’ work on the show because the phrase “find out on the next episode of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>” or some variation has become a long-running joke on the internet.</p><p>Harris narrated the show for over 223 episodes between 1996 and 2003, though that role eventually went to Kyle Hebert, who voices Gohan in the anime. Hebert’s take on the narrator is near-identical to Harris’ booming, guttural delivery, so even if he’s been gone from the franchise for 20 years, his impact can still be felt in more recent dubs of the series. Sadly, Jōji Yanami, the narrator for the Japanese version of the series up until his retirement in 2015, passed away in 2021.</p><p>Harris isn’t the only loss the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise has had to endure in 2024, as series creator Akira Toriyama <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780">passed away in March</a></span>.

          <p>The <em>Alien&nbsp;</em>franchise is about uncaring monsters, unfeeling corporations, and horrific, claustrophobic terror. Given this setting, it almost made sense, what happened to the original <em>Alien: Isolation</em>.</p>
<p>The game was released to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">positive reviews</a>, is now considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best#2014">one of the best games ever made</a>, and sold more than 2 million copies within its first few months. Despite this, <em>Isolation</em> only got "close to break-even or just about in the black," then-Creative Assembly studio director Tim Heaton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/web/20170427202334/http://go.skimresources.com/?id=87431X1540261&amp;site=eurogamer.net&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesindustry.biz%2Farticles%2F2015-09-30-sega-europe-were-definitely-on-the-right-track&amp;xguid=&amp;xuuid=638630bcdcb174d5fd1afe32be6f2553&amp;xsessid=&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20170427202705%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true&amp;xtz=0">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> a year after release. With the rapid evolution of AAA game development, that wasn't enough. And so, like a salvage team diverted to a bio-weapon recovery mission, <em>Isolation</em> and its momentum were seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true">abandoned</a>.</p>

      Gameplay and review accolades for <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, released 10 years ago today.

<p>Abandoned, that is, until today, the 10th anniversary of that game's 2014 release. The appropriately named Al Hope, creative director of <em>Isolation&nbsp;</em>studio Creative Assembly, <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that his team had "heard your distress calls loud and clear," and could confirm that "a sequel to <em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is in early development."</p>
<p>The original game stands out to this day for its bold yet entirely appropriate take on making an&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> game. You play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of iconic heroine Ellen Ripley, working for Weyland-Yutani in a welding job. You get a chance to find out more about what happened to your mother, but—you'll never believe it—things go terribly wrong, and now you are hunted.</p>

                <p>At the end of the 2024 Halo World Championships, 343 Industries made some big announcements about the future of Halo. The studio is rebranding as Halo Studios, and future <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">Halo titles will now be developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>, rather than Slipstream Engine. This move has also reignited speculation about Halo games potentially appearing on PlayStation 5. And according to industry experts, this will make porting Halo a lot easier.</p><p>"From a multi-platform game development perspective, moving to Unreal Engine 5 would certainly be easier for the developer than porting across the existing Slipspace engine," said Digital Foundry's Rich Leadbetter via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "It stands to reason that an engine designed for deployment across multiple platforms would be easier to work with than existing technology built for Xbox and PC."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> reported that Microsoft was considering bringing more games to PlayStation 5, including Halo. While Halo is one of the primary Xbox franchises, cross-platform releases have already proven to be beneficial for Microsoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-sea-of-thieves-takes-advantage-of-ps5s-hardware/1100-6522409/" data-ref-id="1100-6522409">Sea of Thieves</a> found a new audience on PS5, and Bethesda has announced plans to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> to the console following a few months of exclusivity on Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>While switching to Unreal Engine 5 could lead to more titles being ported to PS5, that probably wasn't the primary reason behind the change. Unreal Engine 5 is widely used in the video game industry, and there are more programmers experienced with that engine than programmers who are well-versed in Slipstream Engine. That means new additions to Halo Studios should be able to jump into their projects without any retraining.</p><p>Halo Studios hasn't set a date for the next Halo game, but the 25th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-combat-evolved-review/1900-6076140/" data-ref-id="1900-6076140">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> is only two years away. Microsoft has already indicated that it has plans to celebrate that milestone in 2026, which will coincide with the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox. For now, we can only speculate whether that celebration will include a new Halo game.</p>
