		<p>DeathSprint 66 is… well, it’s like if Sonic had a baby with Wipeout and a buzzsaw. Coming out on 12th September, it’s a futuristic racing game that keeps you on two feet, sprinkles every circuit with deadly lasers, spikes and other traps, and throws in a few power ups for good measure. It’s pretty great.</p>
<p><iframe title="DeathSprint 66 | Episodes Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCn7w76Ztag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the finest traditions of 1980s sci-fi films, DeathSprint’s vision for the year 2066 is one where megalithic media corporations hold sway over our lives, keeping the addled masses entertained with the most brutal and visceral of entertainment. The Bachman Media Network has cooked up the DeathSprint, buying up desolate cities after ecological disasters saw them abandoned, and turning them into race tracks for (cloned) human competitors to race and die in. Move over, sex, it’s actually broadcasting human clones getting turned into bloody pulp that sells.</p>


<p>The eight-person races are fast and furious, and for all the dystopian sci-fi trappings, the controls and handling will be pretty much immediately familiar to fans of cutesy kart racers. You can boost off the line by timing your button press right, there’s boost pads and jump pads to weave your way onto, rails to grind or zipline along, drift-sliding around corners that build up to a boost, and a smattering of item pickups that you can fling at rival competitors or defend yourself with&nbsp;–&nbsp;there’s the usual assortment of homing and untargeted weapons, shields, and builds up to the Giga Saw.</p>


<p>But what sticks out, quite literally, are the deadly traps that you’re trying to evade. Each track is a maze of death with shifting laser barriers, many-teethed grinders, buzzsaws and more that are just waiting for you to misjudge a jump, a racing line, and apex, or get slapped in the back of a head by a competitor boosting past you, and clatter into them. Death feels almost inevitable. Thankfully it’s also temporary for the competitors, with the actual runner kept safe and out of harm’s way, while the remote race clones run through the arenas. You can die and respawn as many times as you like, but after the third, all your cosmetics are stripped away and you are shamed by having a test dummy get-up applied instead.</p>
<p>Winning isn’t everything though, and chaining together different traversal types helps to build up Hype from the viewing audience. Do a good job and you’ll earn more rewards that feed into your Fame rank, earning more interest from sponsors and unlocking cosmetics for your runner.</p>

<p>While Sumo Digital naturally hope that online multiplayer will become the core of the game, there’s also solo modes that go beyond the standard time trials. These single-player ‘episodes’ remix the game, and while branding them as episodes sounds like they’re strings of races, they’re actually a bunch of different variants that ramp up the challenge in a variety of ways and that you can dip in and out of as you choose.</p>
<p>We tried out Killing Time, where you have a minuscule 15 seconds timer that you have to extend by hitting checkpoints, with the hope of reaching the finish line. Five Lives is… well, it gives you five lives to finish the race before it’s game over. Surge Master has you trying to follow chains of lightning symbol pick-ups to build up a high score, while Bloodbath then just doubles the number of traps to make for a cruelly tricky track.</p>

<p>I do love a good dystopian future sports game, and DeathSprint 66 is a fun riff on the tropes of this particular sci-fi genre. Sumo Digital has stuck with the tried and true gameplay of a kart racer, but it’s doing a great job of blending that with a distinctive and deadly flair.</p>

		<p>Exercise Your Demons has been revealed by Vyersoft, and it is a mixed reality fitness game where your coaches are demons. It is coming exclusively to Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro. The game has been developed by Vyersoft and it is set to be released later this year for $19.99.&nbsp; You can watch a teaser for Exercise Your Demons below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exercise Your Demons! (2024) - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJw1K8SSnZI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The hardest thing to do for your fitness isn’t lifting the heaviest weights or running the longest laps,”</em> said Vyersoft founder Matt Conn. <em>“It’s developing a healthy and regular habit. With ‘Exercise Your Demons!’ and its story-driven gameplay, we’ll help our players work up a reliable sweat.”</em></p>
<p>The story Matt mentions is set around the Demonomicon tricking the player into opening a portal between the human world and the Netherworld. As part of this players sign up to the Infernal Gymnasium to train up with Zephyr and Ash to fight against the demon hordes. Outside of the gym players will be fighting against Brimstone Bikers, Hellfire Hooligans, and Infernites in various locations using DeGauntlets to punch back to hell.</p>

<p>Vyersoft’s other projects have included God of Riffs: Battle for the Metalverse and Demons At My Neighbors!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-in-october.967176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that free-to-play mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will shut down in October, and you won't be able to make any more in-app purchases starting from today.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ffbeen/posts/pfbid0qoNuQBi72nxmQBpRsd8MzmEhN72gvzupDzMoovEWvY341oefC1heYgdU4UT1XuDyl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement on the game's Facebook page</a> (of all places), Square Enix says it has made the "difficult decision" to shut down&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>on October 30th. The developer expresses gratitude for the "support" it's received from the community.</p>
<p>By way of a reason for shutting down the game, Square Enix says that while it's "strived to provide an incredible and enjoyable gaming experience" with&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius</em>, it will be "difficult to continue maintaining the app experience".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-ochu.jpg?itok=NLxWH6LA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-ochu.jpg?itok=oHGnabTm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will be no more come October.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher says that sales of the in-game Lapis resource, as well as sales of bundles within&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>, have come to an end as of today, so you can't make any more in-app purchases.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will then officially end service on October 30th at 11:59PM Pacific time, which is around 3am the next morning if you're on Eastern time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as is the case with many mobile apps that end service, in-game events will continue right up until the app's service ends, so if you do want to keep playing&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>until it shuts down, you're more than welcome to.</p>
<p>Unlike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em></a>, however, it doesn't look like there's going to be an offline version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>for you to enjoy. Square Enix says that when service ends, "all player accounts will be deleted".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-dragon.jpg?itok=My06fz6E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-dragon.jpg?itok=wppkPqa4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can keep playing&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>right up until it shuts down at the end of October.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a string of mobile games to end service recently, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down">Nier Reincarnation</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release"><em>Echoes of Mana</em></a>, among others.</p>
<p>While Square Enix doesn't explicitly state the reason that maintaining&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>would be "difficult", live service competition is fierce right now, so it's likely players have simply dwindled to the point that the game is unsustainable.</p>
<p>Intriguingly enough, however, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-global-version-to-end-service-on-october-30" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the Japanese version of<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will continue its operation, so perhaps it's just the Western version that's having trouble retaining players.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>ceases service on October 30th (or 31st, depending on where you are). Make sure you get your time in with the game before then if you've still got stuff to do.</p>

            <p>The situation: Sumo Newcastle are making a dystopian on-foot multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a>, in which you control one of eight Running Men hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The complication: competing against other actual human beings isn't always pleasant or desirable, especially when hurtling through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity. The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed "Episodes" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.</p><!--more-->
<p>These Episodes consist of 3-5 stage tournaments, and they aren't just the same old neon pain gauntlets as in the core eight-player mode. They're custom challenges with "mechanical twists", sayeth the press release. Some of those "twists" take the form of additional spikes and blades.</p>
<p>One of the Episodes is Killing Time - this starts you off with just 15 seconds to reach the first checkpoint and top up your timer before your head explodes. In Five Lives, meanwhile, 'first or last' rules apply and you only have five "clone jockeys" (respawns) to burn through. And then there's Bloodbath Circuits and Bloodbath Sprints, in which maps feature extra hazards and all Tributes (power-ups) are offensive in nature. Catch some of that in action in this here audio-visual montage of people playing Dodge The Chainsaw, an Episode of my own devising which I generally suck at.</p>

<p>I'm on record as being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">a bit sick of satirical deathgames</a> in video games, but I like this one because it reminds me of Blur and because they keep the wisecracks to a minimum. It sure looks... zippy. More WipEout than Blur, perhaps. The full game releases on 12th September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-rostermania-changes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Now that the Call of Duty League’s 2024 season has wrapped up, ‘rostermania’ is in full swing. In the weeks that have followed the end of the Modern Warfare 3 season <strong>and </strong>the Esports World Cup, we’ve seen several players transition into being free agents for the upcoming Black Ops 6 season.</p>



<p>Today, Attach, Huke, and Breszy all revealed that they’re free agents going into the next season, which doesn’t yet have a start date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-changes">Big Changes</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, iLLeY announced he had become an unrestricted free agent, leading many fans to fear for his position next season. He has had a tough year or two thanks to an injury and a brief scandal during which he was accused of using Adderall mid-competition. He barely played this season while flying the Seattle Surge banner, but at just 22 years of age, he has plenty left in the tank.</p>



<p>Today, Attach, Huke, and Breszy revealed that they’re open for business going into the next season, which will be hosted on the Black Ops 6 platform. Huke and Breszy are departing from Seattle Surge while Attach is stepping back from Vegas Legion.</p>



<p>Speaking of Vegas, it was announced last week that Team Falcons will step into Legion’s spot in the Call of Duty League next season. After showing up at the Esports World Cup in Saudi Arabia, Team Falcons’ name has been firmly planted on the map, and the squad will try to gain ground next season in the CDL.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes took place a while ago, with a key shout-out being that Insight is stepping back from Toronto Ultra.</p>



<p>Who will be next to shift around amidst rostermania?</p>

Almost a year later would be about the right time to announce a pre-Christmas launch of a souped-up version of the machine.</p><p>Rumors of the Pro have swirled for a while, beginning around the end of 2023 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1734139732810969273?s=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1734139732810969273?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with claims it was being developed as “Project Trinity,”</a></span> and followed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leak-playstation-spectral-super-resolution-1851340782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leak-playstation-spectral-super-resolution-1851340782">in March this year with talk of proprietary upscaling</a></span>, under the amazing name of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution. It was also claimed that it would almost three times as powerful as the current Xbox Series X’s 12 teraflops, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-pro-specs-leak-video-taken-down-by-sony-strike/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-pro-specs-leak-video-taken-down-by-sony-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony acting fast</a></span> to strike down videos containing such information.</p><p>According to billbil-kun, there are no big surprises for the name of the machine—the leaker claims it’ll just be known as the“PS5 Pro.” They also claim to have seen the packaging the console will come in, but in an attempt to avoid copywrite strikes, they’ve made the unusual move of drawing the design themselves! </p><figure id="" data-id="2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-recommend-id="image://2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A claimed design of the PS5 Pro, sketched by billbil-kun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-recommend-id="image://2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A claimed design of the PS5 Pro, sketched by billbil-kun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It appears it’s very similar in design to the Slim, but for having the three black stripes down the side of its faceplates, rather than the previous one, and not surprisingly being slightly thicker.</p><p>The packaging allegedly seen by <em>Dealabs</em> showed a device without a disc drive, suggesting it might be a separate add-on again, letting people cut costs if they’d rather go digital-only.</p><p>The key information here is the claim that the announcement will be in the next few weeks. This, again, aligns with Sony’s habits. While this would be coming a year later than the announcement of the PS4 Pro, that also came in September with a November release date, but that extra time between original release and Pro launch is easily explained by the year of complete turmoil that followed the launch of the console in the wake of the global pandemic and chip shortages.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My representative works include <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [93 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> III</em>, <em><a title="Games > Persona 3 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a></em>, <em>4</em>, and <em>5</em>.</p><p>In previous showcases, we’ve revealed the general flow of the game, as well as the combat and story elements. In this ATLUS-exclusive showcase, World Tour Edition, we will be going over the “journey” aspects, a wonderful hallmark of fantasy <a title="Genres > RPG [16,572 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>.</p><p>The journey gameplay is what uniquely sets this game apart from the <em><a title="Series > Persona [84 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a></em> and <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> series. I’m extremely excited to share the details with you all. For today’s Exclusive Showcase, World Tour Edition, I’ll be sharing brand new, never-before-seen content. For RPG fans as well as those who are first learning about <em><a title="Platforms > Meta [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>phor</em> through this showcase, I hope you see the fun <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,723 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> you can experience through this game.</p><p>Without further ado, let us depart to the world of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. I hope you stick with us until the very end.</p><p><strong>■ The Start of the Journey</strong></p><p>First, let us start by reviewing the beginning of the game: the story is set in the United Kingdom of Euchronia. The protagonist is on a mission with his fairy companion, Galica, to save his friend, the prince, from a curse. During his journey, he awakens an Archetype, The Seeker. In order to save the prince, he has to defeat the person who cast it. And not only did they curse the prince, the culprit also assassinated the king. The protagonist travels to the Royal Capital to take him down.</p><p>However, upon the king’s death, the king evoked royal magic, which began the Royal Tournament, where the people’s faith is the key to select the next king. As a result, the entire kingdom is thrown into chaos. In all the turmoil, the protagonist makes the decision to participate in the Royal Tournament for the throne, to catch the culprit, Louis. This is how they begin their battle—a journey that takes them all across the kingdom, traveling on a mechanical carriage called the Gauntlet Runner.</p><p><strong>■ Old Castle Town Martira</strong></p><p>This is a town out in the countryside that the party visits in the beginning of the story. While we designed the game to incrementally increase freedoms for the player, obtaining a Gauntlet Runner after the story prologue increases the player’s ability to travel around.</p><p>Let’s explore the town. At each destination are activities unique to that area. In this town, there’s a test of courage where you bungee jump up a cliff. You can also do things like milk cows. Through these activities, you can increase your virtues as a traveler. Increasing these virtues enables you to take on new requests.</p><p>It’s up to you, the player, on how you want to spend every single day of your journey before encountering your main quest. Leading up to your main quests, you can strengthen your forces by completing side quests, increase your bonds with your followers, or do activities that increase the protagonist’s virtues. You have the freedom to choose what you want to do each day, much like real life.</p><p>If you want to improve your fighting abilities, you can visit the recruitment center to accept side requests called bounties to exterminate monsters. We took on a request to exterminate a monster called Valmo. You get information on its whereabouts, but there’s no need to head out immediately if you’re not prepared for the fight.</p><p>This person standing outside looks like he has a request for us. We’ve been asked to buy something from a nearby town. There’s a stop on the way to the labyrinth where the Valmo is, for the extermination request we took on. There’s a lot of people in town that have information. There’s some who will talk to you about the main quest, but in this town, you can also ask about the town’s specialties. Among these people, the informant is particularly valuable for getting intel. They’re useful resources, as you can learn more about rumors as well as the habits of monsters that you might come across. But the information costs money. If you’re confident in your fighting abilities, you could choose to tackle enemies without buying the information beforehand.</p><p>Here’s someone who can tell us about how the Royal Tournament is going. The protagonist’s goal is to get closer to Louis, who also has the ability to become king himself because of the royal magic. Let’s see what our current standing is. Looks like we’re quite a ways from being in the public eye. This ranking changes through story development, but it also increases through completing quests.</p><p>As you can see, the player has a lot of options on how they want to spend each day of their journey. You can use the online feature, Traveler’s Voices, to see how other players spent that day. You can also use it to reference the party formations of other players who beat the quest you’re tackling. Each player will have their own day-to-day way of progressing through their journey as they move through the story, which is one of the true charms <em>Metaphor</em> offers.</p><p>Let’s move on and see how it’s like to travel on a Gauntlet Runner.</p><p><strong>■ Traveling on the Gauntlet Runner</strong></p><p><strong>Expeditions on the Gauntlet Runner</strong></p><p>When you open the map, your allies will give advice on destinations and tell you what the schedule will be. We have two requests to do in Komero, so let’s head there.</p><p>It’s dangerous outside of town, so traveling is done by Gauntlet Runner. While on the road, you can do things you might do in real life when on a camper van, such as reading or <a title="Genres > Cooking [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>. How you perform in battle can vary greatly depending on how you decide to prepare yourself while en route somewhere.</p><p><strong>Passing Time in the Gauntlet Runner</strong></p><p>Your allies have their own things they do while on the Gauntlet Runner. Let’s try talking to Strohl to see what he’s up to. He invited us to do weapon maintenance with him. It looks like maintaining your weapon hones your Courage. By improving your virtues like this, others’ perception of the protagonist changes. It’s particularly indispensable for gaining cooperation from your Followers, so we should do what we can to raise these virtues. </p><p>Players are free to choose how they spend their time while on the gauntlet runner. You can make special items in the kitchen, or even do laundry with your allies. Looks like we found an item from the laundry; someone must have been hiding it.</p><p>Like how you spend time in town, players can choose what to do and enjoy their journey at a smooth pace. You can also stop by a nearby village if there is one. We got something; let’s go hand it to our ally right away.</p><p>We’ve finished our request from Neuras, the gauntlet runner engineer. Thanks to that, we awakened the Gunner Archetype. Completing quests like this is an important factor for deepening your bonds with your followers.</p><p>Let’s go buy the eggs that someone requested we get for them. They’re also selling bath salts that you can’t find in town. You can buy valuable items like this on your travels, so you should try visiting as many places as you can.</p><p><strong>■ <a title="Platforms > Quest [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a> Dungeons</strong></p><p>Looks like the gauntlet runner arrived at the labyrinth called “Man-Eater’s <a title="Games > Grotto [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grotto">Grotto</a>.” Let’s try channeling that Gunner Archetype we just got. The Gunner can attack quickly from afar in Fast Battle, so it’s relatively easy to get an advantage and move to a Squad Battle, even for those who aren’t that good with real-time <a title="Genres > Action [2,129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p>In Squad Battle, the Gunner shoots ranged physical attacks and also maintains its attack power from the back row. One of the benefits of improving your bonds with your followers is that you can obtain new Archetypes, which gives you more strategies to use in battle in addition to unlocking all kinds of useful abilities you can use in battle.</p><p>By the way, you can always return to your base town from the dungeon in an instant, so if you feel underleveled, you can always retreat. If you can’t complete a dungeon within a day, you can set up camp in front of the dungeon and go back to tackling it the next day. However, don’t get too distracted on tackling dungeons that you forget the time limit for your main mission.</p><p><strong>In the Belly of the Worm</strong></p><p>What we just looked at were dungeons for the mini side quests we have in store for you, but let’s take a look at another kind of dungeon as well. Here’s a first look at a main quest dungeon: it’s the belly of a giant worm, believe it or not! It’s a dungeon with a special time limit since you have to escape before you get digested and dissolve.</p><p>There are a lot of creative fantasy dungeons that await you on your journey in <em>Metaphor</em>. We’ve prepared a lot of dungeons, big and small, and we hope you look forward to them. Now then, let’s continue on with the main quest.</p><p>Now then, let’s continue on with our journey!</p><p><strong>■ Port Brilehaven</strong></p><p>Here’s a first look at the town, Port Brilehaven. It’s a lively port town where sailors come and go. First, let’s head towards the port itself. You can see a lot of street stalls lined up.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the armor shop. Thanks to one of my followers’ abilities, I can get a discount here. And after talking to the owner, it seems like there’ll be a sale soon.</p><p>Here’s the port area. There’s some strange balls of water. There are a lot of strange sights throughout the area of Brilehaven. There’s also a coliseum further inside the city. Can you tell how many things are in store for you to do?</p><p>Let’s keep walking. Now we’re in the area where the tavern is. There are a lot of inns, too. Business is booming from people coming in for the Royal Tournament for the throne.</p><p>Here is a seafood restaurant, which you might expect from an ocean town.</p><p>The more you progress through the story, the more there is for you to do. If you’re unsure about what to do, you can always press teh Ask Gallica button to ask your fairy companion for advice. She’ll always help show you around, like a concierge for your travels.</p><p><strong>■ Travel Routines</strong></p><p><strong>Planning Your Travel Route</strong></p><p>Your travel map will slowly get more and more complex. As you can see on this screen, there are multiple routes you can take to get to the same location. If you visit multiple places in one stretch, the number of days you use will decrease proportionally, but you may end up needing to tackle battle after battle, so you’ll need the power to match. Planning your travel route is another area of the game where you’ll have to strategize carefully.</p><p><strong>Campsites</strong></p><p>Despite how tough gauntlet runners are, it’s still dangerous to go around at night because of the monsters running free. So at night, the party pause their travels and rest up at a campsite. Here, you can take your pick of nighttime activities,  such as having a relaxed conversation with your allies, or taking a bath.</p><p>Let’s try taking a soak in the cask tub at the back of the deck. While we’re at it, let’s use the bath salt that we bought at one of the villages before. It has a relaxing effect, which increased the protagonist’s stats. By the way, there are different kinds of bath salts available, which you can find as you travel throughout the land.</p><p><strong>Encountering the Scenic Sights</strong></p><p>Looks like we came across something. Another pleasure of traveling is coming across scenic sights you’d only see in another world. An ally will draw you a commemoration sketch. If you give it to one of your Followers, a young girl who’s awaiting your return in Grand Trad, will be happy.</p><p><strong>■ The Uncharted Isle: Virga Island</strong></p><p>Here’s another location reveal: a place called Virga Island. On this island, you can enjoy unique tracks themed after religious music composed by <a title="People > Shoji Meguro [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/people/shoji-meguro">Shoji Meguro</a>, who is well known for his work on the <em>Persona</em> series.</p><p>Here, the protagonist makes yet another new encounter. Her name is Eupha, a new ally that’s only now being revealed in this showcase. I wonder what role she plays in the protagonist’s journey. I hope you look forward to learning more about her in the future.</p><p><strong>■ Review</strong></p><p>So, what do you think? If you had to actually go on a long journey in real life, it wouldn’t be a simple endeavor. Taking that into account, we hope that you enjoy the journey of <em>Metaphor</em>, where you can travel as you please in the comfort of your own home.</p><p>Though we’ve largely focused on the profound fantasy elements <em>Metaphor</em>, simply, it is also a game filled with the joys of traveling from town to town, an element we hope for in fantasy RPGs.</p><p>Though this title is a rare attempt from us at the fantasy genre, we aim to make this a culmination of the efforts in our previous RPGs.</p><p>We hope everyone, including fans familiar with <em>Persona</em> and <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, as well as those who love fantasy RPGs, enjoys playing <em>Metaphor</em>.</p><p>We’ve shared information on <em>Metaphor</em>‘s world setting and story, battle system, and other aspects of the game in other Showcases. Please feel free to take a look at those if you haven’t already.</p><p>The next Exclusive Showcase coming out this fall will reveal exciting new information. Please look forward to it. In addition, Tokyo Game Show 2024 is taking place this fall, and we will be having a large exhibit where we’ll offer a hands-on game experience of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. On top of being able to experience the journey gameplay like we introduced today, there will also be another special demo available to play at the event. We’ll release more details related to the event in the future. We look forward to seeing you at Tokyo Game Show.</p><p>Once again, <em>Metaphor</em> is scheduled for release this fall on October 11, 2024. Both the physical and digital editions are available for pre-orders, so please pre-order your copy or add it to your wishlist. Along with the standard edition, a Digital Deluxe Edition commemorating the 35th anniversary of the ATLUS brand is also available.</p><p>See you at the next ATLUS Exclusive Showcase.

            <p>
Doom has been ported to dozens of devices, but it's never been playable quite like this. 
</p>
<p>
Google researchers have now generated an AI version of the retro first-person shooter classic entirely via neural network, based on ingested video clips of gameplay.
</p>
<p>
It's a milestone, if a grim one, recorded in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14837">paper</a> published this week entitled "Diffusion models are real-time game engines" (thanks, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-gamengen-ai-breaks-new-ground-by-simulating-doom-without-a-game-engine/">VentureBeat</a>). This documents how a small team from Google were able to "interactively simulate" a version of Doom, with only a "slightly better than random chance" of humans being able to tell the difference.
</p>
<p>
Humans are still (currently) required to play Doom first, to provide the video clips of gameplay that are then fed into GameNGen, the research team's game engine which is "powered entirely by a neural model". It's the same principle as the now-commonplace ability for AI to learn from and then generate static images, based on ingesting huge amouts of dubiously-sourced data online.
</p>
<p>
GameNGen then produces sequential frames based on its learnings of 'watching' that gameplay, which are then output at 20fps with a visual quality "comparable to the original". Here's how it looks:

<p>
"Can a neural model running in real-time simulate a complex game at high quality?" the paper asks. "In this work we demonstrate that the answer is yes. While not an exact simulation, the neural model is able to perform complex game state updates, such as tallying health and ammo, attacking enemies, damaging objects, opening doors, and persist the game state over long trajectories. 
</p>
<p>
"GameNGen answers one of the important questions on the road towards a new paradigm for game engines, one where games are automatically generated, similarly to how images and videos are generated by neural models in recent years. Key questions remain, such as how these neural game engines would be trained and how games would be effectively created in the first place, including how to best leverage human inputs. We are nevertheless extremely excited for the possibilities of this new paradigm."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, a major Eurogamer investigation looked at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">how AI was already changing video game development forever</a> - with positive and negative results. A report from Unity in March claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">more than 60 percent of game developers were already using AI</a> at some stage in the development process.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If there’s one thing that never really made sense in Civilization games, it’s that the US of A could rival Ancient Egypt in a quest for supremacy, or that the British and Roman empires could run as contemporaries. That a single culture could persist through from prehistoric times, progress through countless technological leaps across the ages, and blast off into outer space to colonise the stars. The fact of the matter is that, for almost every meteoric rise of a nation throughout history, there has been a similarly meteoric collapse or massive internal change.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Official Gameplay Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tc3_EO6Bj2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s something that I guess a lot of developers started to think about all at once in the wake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/21/civilization-vi-review/">Civilization 6</a>‘s 2016 release. Firaxis themselves took a stab at it with the Rise and Fall expansion, and the last couple years has seen <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">Humankind</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/26/millennia-review/">Millennia</a> and the soon-to-be-released Ara: History Untold. Now Firaxis is having another go with Civilization 7, incorporating the concept of ages and the rise and fall of empires into the very fabric of the game.</p>


<p>Underneath it all, Civ 7 will feel like Civ 6 a lot of the time. There’s common ground with the visual direction, the way that cities will sprawl across many map tiles, there’s still separated technology and civic trees, and the military doom stacks of earlier games won’t be making a return… though there is a fresh approach to marshaling your military forces. The biggest changes will come to the overarching structure of a game and the progression of your nation.</p>


<p>Each game of Civ 7 will feature three distinct ages –&nbsp;Antiquity, Exploration, Modern –&nbsp;that will last up to 200 turns per age, but can be spurred along by player action and progress. As each age draws to a close, your civilisation will have to deal with change that sweeps across the world, and crises beset all the global powers, forcing you to shift priorities. Barbarians appearing at the gates will always focus the mind, and could see you seeking peace with a rival nation as you prepare for the next transition –&nbsp;you actually get to choose which crises you face by picking crisis cards at the end of the age.</p>
<p>These are, to a certain extent, the end times for your nation, but really it’s just about choosing what comes next. You’ll have a choice of what civilisation you want to become, with the game giving you a few options that will look at the historically accurate succession, as well as how you’re actually playing. If, for example, your Egyptians are roving the world on horseback, you’ll be given the option of becoming Mongolia in the Age of Exploration.</p>
<p>Within each age you’ll have a handful of Legacy Paths you can choose to follow, mapping to the Science, Economic, Cultural and Military victory conditions, and giving you campaign-long bonuses as you pursue these directions. Early on you can select which path you wish to follow and then they’ll push quests to you that match more of what you want, and in turn will inform the successive civs you can pick.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a fascinating new perspective on the way that history is retold and remixed within the 4X genre. Still, alongside this high-level change there’s also plenty of smaller tweaks and changes to refine the fundamental gameplay.</p>

<p>Cities will still spread across the map one tile at a time, but Civ 7 is a bit more restrictive in making each tile you place link back to the main city, instead of having free reign within a broader area. As you build improvements, construct wonders and iconic landmarks, those will persist with you through the ages, even as the general buildings in a city change and modernise. I can’t wait to see how this actually comes together, blending together the ages.</p>
<p>Leaders and civilisations are now separated, so a leader can stay with your nation through the ages, but also allowing Firaxis to broaden the historical figures that they include, so there will be more scientists and philosophers alongside the staple historical heads of state.</p>

<p>On the diplomatic side of things, you now accrue Influence, which is what you need to perform actions against other players, using it to pass treaties, combine resources through endeavours like cultural exchanges and markets, and apply sanctions. It’s also needed to interact with independent states that gradually grow out of the little villages you can find across the globe, and which you can potentially establish good relations with a integrate with your empire down the line.</p>
<p>Finding those little towns and scoping out natural wonders, you’ll naturally do the early-game thing of flinging scouts out into the wider world, and they can now hop into a little boat and paddle up navigable rivers. Of course, as you bump into other nations, you’ll quickly find the need to defend yourself, and Civ 7 brings with it a new way to stack units together.</p>
<p>Essentially, you now have a way of creating an actual army, thanks to the introduction of Commanders. Where Civ 6 had a very restrictive form of unit stacking, a Commander lets you gather together up to six units and send them into battle together. It’s the Commander that will now accrue experience, level up and work through a skill tree in a fashion that’s emblematic of how historical armies can build a rich tradition and reputation, even as they are reinforced with new troops and military doctrines change. One thing you’ll be able to research is the ability to directly reinforce a Commander from your city, pathing them through the world automatically to keep your frontline army at full strength.</p>

<p>With a short 30 minutes hands on with the game, starting from the very beginning, we could barely scratch the surface of these refreshed gameplay mechanics and ideas –&nbsp;with only one city, I couldn’t see how city and civ-wide resources are handled, or really dig into how trade routes have been overhauled through diplomacy, for example –&nbsp;but just this first glimpse, and what Firaxis has presented, gives a thoroughly intriguing evolution of the series.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">Civilization VII is heading to release on 11th February 2025</a>, and for the first time, it will be launching across both PC and consoles at the same time, available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-script-has-over-2-million-words.967068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>director and lead writer Daniel Vávra has taken to social media to reveal just how many words you can expect from the upcoming RPG's script, and it's going to be a veritable behemoth.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1829121370845773942" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;Vávra says that he, along with lead designer Prokop Jirsa, have been "counting" how much the team has written for the hotly-anticipated game, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">due out next year</a>.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Vávra,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script consists of around 2,200,000 words. Yes, you read that right: it's got more than two million words in it. By way of comparison, Tolstoy's&nbsp;<em>War and Peace</em>, one of the longest novels ever written, has around 580,000 words.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-soldiers.jpg?itok=cSqCea-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-soldiers.jpg?itok=O05H8aVT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sure has a lot of words in it.</figcaption></figure><p>As&nbsp;Vávra points out, <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</i>'s word count puts it in line with around "11,000 typical screenwriting pages", which constitutes about 100 scripts for two-hour movies (assuming they're not Aaron Sorkin movies, obviously) or 25 "average novels".</p>
<p>It's fair to say that judging by the number of words in its script alone,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is going to be a pretty mighty epic. Of course, having a lot of words doesn't necessarily mean they're all good words, so we'll have to wait and see if the quality can match the quantity.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">the upcoming followup</a> to 2017's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">realistic medieval RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</p>
<p>The game will once again pick up the story of Henry of Skalitz, who sets out on a journey to avenge his murdered parents. You'll explore a massive realistic world based on 15th-century Europe, discovering all kinds of characters and building your character as you go.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 11th. Stay tuned for more on this one, and while you wait, you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-thy-will-be-done">review of the original game right here</a>.</p>

This nifty little handheld lets you play your fave PS5 games on any screen in the house, streaming games directly from your console over Wi-Fi. That means you can keep the gaming going while someone else hogs the big screen. No more tussling with roommates for screen time. No more elbowing out annoying siblings. With a crisp 1080p display and all the haptic wizardry of the DualSense controller built-in, the Portal delivers that authentic PS5 experience in a pint-sized package. So you can do you, wherever you’d like.</p><h2 id="h158"><a id=""></a><strong>Frigidaire Light Up Mini-Fridge</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-recommend-id="image://913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-recommend-id="image://913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nothing says <em>in it to win it</em> like the mini fridge, reliably stationed within arm’s reach so you can quench that thirst without actually prying your eyes from the screen. But if you did, you’d be positively tickled by the Jetsons vibe of the Frigidaire Light Up Mini-Fridge, a compact 3 pounds and available in four spacey colors—white, blue, stealth (black), and purplehaze (our favorite, obvi). The fridge is as functional as it is cool—it holds up to 6 cans and keeps them frosty. Not cold. Not cool. But legitimately frosty. Yes, the LED lights are over-the-top, but in the dead of night when it’s pitch dark and you’re jonesing for some cold water, you’ll be thankful for the DJ Frigidaire glow.</p><h2 id="h159"><a id=""></a><strong>X-Wing Cosplay Mini Backpack</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-recommend-id="image://690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-recommend-id="image://690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> Pro-tip: indoctrinate your kids in the ways of the Force when they’re young and impressionable.

Avoid the gaming hangover with the Fallout Vault 33 Prescription Glasses from Gunnar, inspired by the iconic Fallout video game series. The amber-tinted lenses filter out harsh blue light, reducing digital eye strain and fatigue during long gaming sessions. They’re lightweight and flexible, so they won’t pinch your temples if you’re wearing a headset. Best of all, the frames, which can be outfitted with prescription lenses, boast a cool, retro-futuristic design that rival anything you’ll get from any luxury maker.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Concord, PlayStation’s online hero shooter from first-party studio Firewalk, launched this week to a Steam <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam"><u>concurrent player count high of 697</u></a>, according to SteamDB. To describe the launch as dismal is an understatement.</p><p>But while this three-figure player count has captured headlines and provoked ridicule across the internet, the detail that caught my eye was that Concord reportedly<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years"><u> spent </u><u><em>eight years</em></u><u> in development</u></a>. That means Concord began its journey sometime around 2016 –  the same year Blizzard released Overwatch.</p><p>Firewalk Studios is made up of veterans from Bungie and Activision, two of the foremost makers of online PvP shooters, so it’s no surprise it attempted to go toe-to-toe with Overwatch to win over fans in the genre given its staff pedigree. But as the saying goes, if you aim for the king, you better not show up eight years late. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/23/concordlaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1724433858377.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Firewalk Studios. PlayStation Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p>With so many games now taking close to a decade from the beginning of development to release, we’re starting to see the financial and creative consequences of an overlong development cycle. Spend too much time in development and ideas that were once novel are no longer in vogue. Furthermore, the time and money spent over those years has to be recouped somehow, which leads to decisions like the $40 cost of entry for Concord when many of its peers are free to play.</p><p>The cost of coming late to the party means you must bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review"><u>Concord</u></a> is neither particularly innovative nor content-heavy. That said, it does have a level of polish at launch that was often absent from its hero shooter peers when they were first released. Indeed, Concord’s weekly animation story drops are fully motion-capture, and Firewalk’s time spent on crafting its lore has helped secure Concord an episode of this winter’s video game animation anthology series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon"><u>Secret Level</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>But as the saying goes, if you aim for the king, you better not show up eight years late.&nbsp;</p></div><p>But well-established hero shooters like EA’s Apex Legends launched almost bare bones and still managed to make a splash thanks to its intriguing central concept which combined hero loadouts with a battle royale match format. Valve’s Deadlock doesn’t even have finalized assets or art but has still caused a huge burst of excitement among the PC community, thanks to the way itchanges up the classic 6v6 hero formula with its heavy lane-and-minions MOBA mechanics. By contrast Concord appeared with an all-too-familiar offering and, frankly, the time spent on finessing its presentation – the graphics, motion capture, performance, and so on – likely lead to a later release date which in turn meant it lost valuable time establishing itself among its peers. If it had been released four or five years ago, when the PS5 first came out, maybe its launch would have been an entirely different story.</p><p>So that begs the question: was the lengthy time spent in development worth it?</p><p>We know it now takes longer than ever to make a AAA game. And while technological improvements have brought about previously unimaginable levels of detail, customers have now spent decades expecting bigger open-worlds, better graphics, and more hair follicles on a character than ever before. This has created a vicious cycle where, if studios want to meet those particular player expectations, games must take longer to make so that they can meet the bar set by the technological advancements achieved by prior games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This creates a very risky dilemma, particularly for those aiming to dominate the live-service space. Knowing the cost and development time required for a AAA online game, studios have to assess, predict and/or simply guess  as to what will be the  next big hit. What game will succeed in four, five, six years time if we begin developing it right now? Will the audience still care for that kind of game when we’re finally ready to release it? It practically requires the services of a fortune-teller to get the answer right.</p><p>Some get it right. Blizzard correctly judged the appetite for a Team Fortress 2-like shooter that adopted the hero kits of MOBAs. Others get it wrong – Epic’s original tower-defense version of Fortnite, in development for around six years, completely misread the market. Luckily Epic had the resources to pivot Fortnite to an online battle royale after witnessing the skyrocketing success of PUBG. It soon learned that the rewards for quickly jumping onto a trend can be limitless. But quick is the optimal word here.</p><p>Concord isn’t the only game that this year that’s the product of a  poorly judged, time-consuming gamble in the ever-changing landscape of live-service games.</p><p>Like Concord, Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League was released with a level of polish and detail unseen by other online multiplayer shooters. And, also like Concord, it suffered from a lack of content and innovation. These flaws meant Suicide Squad was unable to attract players from rival PvE games, while also alienating Rocksteady’s fans who adored the studio’s single-player Batman games. Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League spent <em>nine years</em> in development. Soon after release, publisher Warner Bros. called the game a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>disappointment that cost the company $200 million.</u></a></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All I know for sure is releasing an Overwatch competitor two years after Overwatch 2 was released feels like a mighty disadvantage.</p></div><p>Live-service games, by their nature, are at the mercy of time more than any other format, but even single-player games can be victims of the overlong development cycle . Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Ubisoft’s long-awaited samurai ninja game set in feudal Japan, is finally coming out this fall. The only problem is Sucker Punch released a very good, open-world, samurai assassin game almost four years ago in 2020, beating Ubisoft to the punch. It remains to be seen if this will affect Shadows’ sales, but there’s certainly a vocal section of the Assassin’s Creed community that feels like Ghosts of Tsushima has already provided the experience they wanted. </p><p>So what’s the solution? It’s certainly not developers crunching themselves to death to make games faster. But, unfortunately there are just no easy answers to this situation that is, as far as I can tell, unique to the medium.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>One solution that’s been bandied about is to make shorter games. I’ve personally advocated for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-sequels-like-uncharted-lost-legacy-are-the-future"><u>need of more half-sequels</u></a> like Uncharted: Lost Legacy that offers fans a chance at enjoying a new game in a beloved franchise, both at a lower price and sooner than a full sequel game. But while I’m personally a fan of shorter games, I know I’m in the minority. When games are $70 each, it’s understandable that many players want something that offers significant bang for their buck. Plus, shorter lengths is only a potential solution for big AAA franchises where it’s now become accepted that if we want a new Fallout, GTA, or The Last of Us, we’re going to be waiting a decade for it.</p><p>For online games like Concord and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, though, it might just be that the longer you spend losing ground to rival games, the worse the outlook is at launch. You either need a completely novel gameplay mechanic a la Apex Legends or Deadlock, or hope your game has <em>the juice</em>, as the kids say. All I know for sure is releasing an Overwatch competitor two years after Overwatch 2 was released feels like a mighty disadvantage.</p><p><em>Matt T.M. Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

The solution: start a new save.</p><p>Here’s Ubisoft’s initial message:</p><blockquote>To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused...Once you’ve confirmed you have the latest version, please start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended. If you continue on a prior save you will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers.</blockquote><p>Players complained that they were forced into losing hours of progress through no fault of their own, a loss made all the worse by the fact that it occurred during Star Wars Outlaws’ early access period, which was reserved for those who paid more than $100 for the Gold Edition.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Now, Ubisoft has offered a make-good to affected players: an in-game Trailblazer trinket and 100 Ubisoft Connect Units. These units are Ubisoft Connect loyalty points, which can be used on in-game rewards and Ubisoft Store discounts.</p><p>Here’s Ubisoft’s latest message, sent to affected players via email:</p><blockquote>We are following up on the previous email we sent you regarding "Issues with an outdated version on PlayStation 5".<p>We fully acknowledge that asking you to start a new game is not the best experience, especially during the early access period, and for that we apologize.<br>To make your return to the Outer Rim a little more special, we are granting you an in-game Trailblazer trinket as well as 100 Ubisoft Connect Units (to redeem for in-game rewards, for example). We are actively working on adding the Ubisoft Connect Units to your account so you can use these as soon as possible, and you can collect the Trinket from the delivery crate in the back of the Trailblazer once you reach Toshara.<br>We appreciate your patience, and we hope you enjoy the game.</p></blockquote><p>These units are already being called “worthless” by some disgruntled players. “I lost 15 hours of progress,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f3k86w/comment/lkevjks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor 00schneider</a>. “Well, I explored a lot so I took my time. Today I was forced to start all over and I rushed in ~6 hours to nearly the state I was before. Yes, it sucks that they couldn't just release a hotfix. Yes, the compensation for it is laughable. At least they could've given us some materials to upgrade our vehicles and the blaster a little faster. But the game is still fun and I hope no other game breaking bugs appear.”</p><p>Others who have yet to run into any issues are now worried about losing their progress if they update the game. “I’ve just seen the email tonight,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f3k86w/comment/lkfcy20/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Flash__PuP said</a>. “I’m 20hrs in with three maxed out experts and max affinity with Pyles and all others at good standing. This makes me just want to pack it in.”</p><p>The good news is that Patch 1.000.002 sounds like a big upgrade for Star Wars Outlaws, enhancing the visual fidelity on PS5 while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>addressing some of the issues we alluded to in our review</u></a>. The 40fps support is an especially big deal, as it enhances Star Wars Outlaw's visual fidelity without sacrificing too much of the fluidity from a higher frame-rate.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launches proper across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S on August 30. In the meantime, if you're planning on picking up Star Wars Outlaws, we have plenty of guides to help you explore Ubisoft's version of a galaxy far, far away, including our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-outlaws/Walkthrough"><u>walkthrough</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-outlaws/Side_Quests"><u>sidequests</u></a>, and more.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is just under two months away from release, but the biggest weapon in players' arsenals has has already been unleashed. During Call of Duty Next, streamer JustHazzardous dropped the first nuke even before the game's official beta period had begun. The results were understandably explosive, and even fatal for his character.</p><p>JustHazzardous claims to have pulled off a similar feat last year by setting off a nuke in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-review-return-of-the-makarov/1900-6418152/" data-ref-id="1900-6418152">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>. In the new video, the effects of the nuke are seen almost immediately as the playable character drops his weapon before his arms burst into flames. Moments later, the screen cuts to a mushroom cloud--the signature imagery of a nuclear explosion.</p><p>Previous Call of Duty games have awarded nukes to players who can kill 25 enemies in a row without dying. Presumably Black Ops 6 has a similar threshold before giving gamers access to the ultimate equalizer. Treyarch, the lead developer of Black Ops 6, subsequently sent out a congratulatory message to JustHazzardous for his achievement.</p><p>Call of Duty Next is just the prelude event to the early access for the Black Ops 6 beta, which will run from August 30 to September 4 across all consoles and PC. The open beta period will follow from September 6-9. During those extended previews, players should be able to see more of Black Ops 6's throwback to the '90s, as well as more maps, weapons, and other features of the game.</p><p>Activision will release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on October 25 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
