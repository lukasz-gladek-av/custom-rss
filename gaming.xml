<p>Marvel Rivals is very slowly and tentatively moving towards establishing an esports scene, but more and more organizations are already looking to set up shop. A handful of prestigious legacy organizations are in the process of signing rosters, and more could be on the way as bigger Marvel Rivals tournaments spring up.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-esports-organizations-are-in-marvel-rivals">Which Esports Organizations are in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>On February 26, Fnatic became the latest esports organization to <a href="https://x.com/FNATIC/status/1894796444390830146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enter</a> Marvel Rivals, signing a roster to compete in the upcoming EMEA Invitational. The six-person team consists of a handful of former Overwatch pros and a former Fortnite World Cup participant. Fnatic is a globally recognized esports organization, famous for its Swedish CS:GO dynasty and from earning over a half dozen trophies in European League of Legends.</p>



<p>Fnatic are by no means the only prestigious organization to jump right in to Marvel Rivals. OG, the European organization built on winning Dota 2’s The International twice, <a href="https://x.com/OGesports/status/1894792288699580668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> their Marvel Rivals roster hours before Fnatic did. Virtus.pro <a href="https://virtus.pro/en/articles/virtuspro-otkryvayut-sostav-po-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed</a> a decorated roster of Overwatch League veterans on February 19. All three of those organizations, alongside Twisted Minds, Team Peps, Luminosity, DUSTY, and the ECSTATIC roster, have been invited to the EMEA Invitational.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Several other organizations are currently considering Marvel Rivals rosters. Sentinels, one of the most globally recognized and successful brands in VALORANT, <a href="https://x.com/robmooreEsports/status/1892336173928108123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> it would participate in Marvel Rivals. CEO Rob Moore said he sees “tremendous potential” in the competitive Marvel Rivals scene, and opened the gates for virtually anyone to try out. Sentinels will in all likelihood compete in North America. 100 Thieves, another prominent organization based in North America, has also <a href="https://x.com/100Thieves/status/1894809669660713006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> its interest. The invites for the North American Invitational have not been sent out yet.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has seemingly achieved sustainable popularity, maintaining a presence at the top of the Steam player charts since the game released. The team at NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has prioritized a “coexisting” between casual and competitive play</a>. Back in January, the game’s director said they are taking a lot of references from games that have thriving casual and competitive player pools.</p>

                <p>Razer has unveiled the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05297ER3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 18 (2025)</a>, its most powerful gaming laptop to date. Like the recently announced Blade 16, the new 18-inch Razer laptop utilizes the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs. Both of Razer's new high-end gaming laptops are available to preorder now and expected to release on April 30. The Blade 18 starts at $3,200, while the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-new-razer-blade-18-has-a-unique-dual-mode-display-and-rtx-50-series-gpu%2F1100-6529726%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blade 16</a> retails for $2,800 and up.</p><hr><p>Preorders for the Blade 18 come with the Laptop Stand Chroma ($130 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($65 value). If you preorder the Blade 16, you'll get Razer's USB-C Dock ($120 value) and the X-Ray Chroma Skin ($60 value).</p><p>The Blade 18 has a unique dual-mode display that supports 3840 x 2400 UHD+ resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate. Alternatively, the screen can render images at 1920 x 1200 FHD+ resolution with a blistering 480Hz refresh rate.</p><h2>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</h2><h3>Starting at $3,200</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450719"></a><figcaption>Razer Blade 18 (2025)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4450719-httpsmedias-p1.phoenix.razer.com.jpg"></figure><p>With the option to customize the Razer Blade 18 with up to an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU, it should be ready to handle anything you throw at it. The RTX 5070 Ti comes standard, while upgrading to the RTX 5080 costs an extra $500 and the RTX 5090 costs $1,300. All GPUs are paired to an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX (5.4GHz) yet the chassis remains slim at just 21.99mm thick. You’ll also get to pick your SSD size, ranging from 1TB to 4TB. The same goes for memory, with options for 32GB or 64GB models.</p><p>Beyond all the power, one of the most intriguing features of the Blade 18 is its new display. Razer says it’s the “world’s first” 18-inch dual-mode display, allowing you to run games with a UHD+ resolution of 3840x2400 and 240Hz refresh rate or FHD+ resolution of 1920x1200 and 440Hz refresh rate. That gives you the flexibility to choose whichever option is best for your current needs (resolution or speed), making the Blade suitable for all sorts of tasks.</p><p>Cooling the unit is a three-fan system that should quickly dissipate any accumulated heat, while the keyboard has been redesigned with new scissor switches featuring a 35% increase in travel distance compared to the outgoing model. There’s also a 10-key numpad and dual-LED backlighting per key.</p><p>Combined with a six-speaker THX system and a 5MP webcam, it’s clear Razer has built the Blade 18 to battle with the most premium gaming laptops on the market.</p><p>If you prefer AMD processors, the Razer Blade 16 comes with the new Ryzen AI 9 365 CPU. You can pair AMD's high-end CPU with one of the RTX 50-Series graphics cards. The Blade 16 has a 1600p QHD+ OLED display capable of 240Hz refresh rates. You're missing out on the dual-mode display tech, but you're getting an OLED screen instead.

Platinum will join the GOG Preservation Program</a> by next month, and may also be the first of more Monolith games to hit the program.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inflential 2005 first-person shooter is getting moved up on GOG's timeline for the Preservation Program to "properly recognize Monolith's contributions to gaming." <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Preservation Program</a> is GOG's initiative to keep classic games playable on modern systems, maintaining the titles in DRM-free form and with dedicated tech support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has previously featured everything from Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete, to the original Resident Evil trilogy, to I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It's an eclectic spotlight of games preserved in playable form, available on GOG's storefront, and F.E.A.R. Platinum — which includes the base F.E.A.R. and both expansions — will soon join the lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be the last Monolith game there, either. GOG said that other Monolith icons will "join eventually as well." The storefront also teased more news to come about the Preservation Program tomorrow, February 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preservation effort is a nice recognition of Monolith Productions' legacy in the wake of its sudden closure. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news yesterday that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios">Warner Bros. had canceled its planned Wonder Woman game and shuttered three studios</a>: Monolith, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros.' games division has been in a difficult spot for some time. While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-ps5-xbox-pc">Hogwarts Legacy</a> chalked up a commercial win for the publisher, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League spurred a double-digit decline in revenue</a>, and the financial failure of Smash-alike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may">MultiVersus</a> piled on the misery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">David Haddad is set to leave the company</a> after 12 years of helming Warner Bros. Games, and the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-wb-discovery-looking-to-sell-off-games-other-divisions-to-prevent-total-breakup" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">division is rumored to be considered for-sale</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith had a legacy dating back decades, with games like Blood, Condemned: Criminal Origins, No One Lives Forever, and The Matrix Online on its resume. Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor became an instant hit, spurred on by its inventive "Nemesis System," which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">Warner Bros. held in a vice-grip with its patent</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Monolith may be closed, it's nice to see other companies acknowledge the effect one studio has had on the medium. Hopefully we see more of Monolith's classics preserved for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gallery-card-seemingly-teases-hellfire-gala-theme-and-characters-for-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keen-eyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> players have spotted an in-game reference that seems to suggest that Season 2’s theme and characters will revolve around the classic Marvel comics storyline, the Hellfire Gala.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information on what NetEase Games could be planning for its next seasonal content drop was first spotted and shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1iy4eu3/season_2_is_hellfire_gala_confirmed_in_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>by Reddit user DynamiteDynamo10</u></a>. Their post includes a screenshot of the "Plans Within Plans" Gallery Card included in the in-game event page in Season 1, containing dialog and story details tied to the current season. It’s a lengthy entry in what is already a game brimming with lore, but what’s interesting is how it ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend,” the post concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not exactly an all-out reveal that Season 2 will follow a story set around Marvel’s well-known gala event, but it is at least a suspicious mention that you’ll need to dig to find. Meanwhile, other players are using Doctor Doom’s gala reference as fuel to the fire that are the rumors that X-Men regular Emma Frost will soon join Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly leaked Emma Frost voice lines were <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1893535638214922567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared online by X0XLeak</u></a> this past weekend, kicking off speculation that the diamond-skinned character could be added sooner rather than later. She also happens to play a part in the original Hellfire Gala storyline along with a laundry list of other Marvel icons. Voice lines like this are suspicious on their own, so coupled with the reference to the gala, these details have some players already plotting out how Emma Frost could break apart the current Marvel Rivals meta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development makes sense for many, others are saying the reference isn’t enough to confirm which Marvel names will join the Marvel Rivals roster in Season 2. If the next content drop, which is expected to arrive mid-April, is truly set to add content themed around the Hellfire Gala, then the Gallery Card is the first time NetEase has said anything official on the matter. So, even if we assume Season 2 centers around the Hellfire Gala, the story could include Emma Frost or go a different path completely.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, so many other players have spent the entirety of Marvel Rivals Season 1’s vampire-themed romp expecting to see Blade join as the next playable character following multiple in-game appearances. Some have suggested that this could mean we see the Daywalker join for one half of the season while Emma joins in another, while others theorize that Emma may not join until Season 3. At the least, NetEase has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">it plans to deliver at least one new character every half-season</a>, so Season 2 is sure to surprise players one way or another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these details are based purely on speculation; we won’t know what NetEase has planned for at least another few weeks. Until the team has more to share about the future of Marvel Rivals, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-just-made-a-classic-moon-knight-meme-feel-a-little-more-real">how it chose to include a reference to an infamous Moon Knight meme</a> as part of its mid-season update.

Can you handle even higher speeds of play? Starting at Level 20, the Time Warp Tetrimino piece will no longer feature the golden-colored Tetrimino, so you won’t be able to create Matrix-clearing cascades. And starting on Level 28, the lockdown speed of Tetriminos will greatly increase.</li><li><strong>Time Warp Shield</strong> – In <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode, the Time Warp Tetriminos now have a new power – Shield! <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>r a line including a Time Warp Tetrimino while the Shield design is showing, and you’ll earn a Shield that will stop other players from sending you into a Time Warp. It disappears after being used once.</li><li><strong>1989 Mode Upgrades</strong> – Enjoy playing <em>Tetris</em> with black-and-white graphics and <a title="Companies > chiptune" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/chiptune">chiptune</a> sounds? 1989 Mode, a single-player mode found within <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, now has a variety of fixes and new options. You can choose to turn off “Modern Gameplay” and experience more historically accurate gameplay. You can also optionally choose to play the game with 18 rows in the Matrix, as opposed to the modern-day setting of 20 rows.</li><li><strong>Take the 40-Line Challenge</strong> – Celebrate <em>Tetris</em>‘ 40th anniversary by trying to clear 40 lines as quickly as you can. Playable in both Modern and 1989 modes.</li><li><strong>Options, Options, Options</strong> – A vastly expanded Options menu lets you customize the visuals, sounds, and gameplay in <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> to your liking. Turn individual graphic effects on or off, and tweak your gameplay with new options like the Initial Hold and Initial Rotation systems, Diagonals, and more.</li></ul><p>Many other bug fixes, tweaks, and minor changes to all modes to improve the <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> experience.</p><p><strong>New MS-DOS Games Added to <em>Tetris Forever</em></strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong><em>Super Tetris</em></strong> – Released by Spectrum Holobyte in 1991, this was an early attempt at creating a “sequel” to <em>Tetris</em>. The gameplay is quite different — the Matrix is half-full of garbage when a game begins, and players can earn and use Bombs to clear out the spaces and find power-ups buried in the garbage. It includes Cooperative and Competitive multiplayer modes, in which two players play in the same Matrix!</li><li><strong><em>Tetris</em> (AcademySoft) v. 3.12</strong> – A historically important inclusion, this is the final version of <em>Tetris</em> created within the Soviet Union in the Academy of Sciences, ported from Alexey Pajitnov’s original Pascal code by Vadim Gerasimov. Dating to 1988, it is notable for its inclusion of Phantom mode, in which all O-Tetriminos (square-shaped pieces) are invisible!</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Updates</strong></p><ul><li>The gameplay behaviors in the recreation of the Electronika 60 version of <em>Tetris</em> have been updated to be even more historically accurate to the original version.</li><li>Now includes language support for Korean and Traditional Chinese.</li><li>Many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements have been made to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,751 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,807 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,699 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,469 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tetris_forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Jeff Bezos Presents: The News]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jeff-bezos-presents-the-news.1119705/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos shared a new direction for the paper’s opinion section, both with staff and, for some reason, with all of <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>: from now on, the opinion section will “be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” As a result, opinion section editor David Shipley is out, and I am losing my fucking mind.</p><p>In a message so unhinged I literally had to check with people that it wasn’t an elaborate hack, Bezos writes&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.</p><p>I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity….</p><p>I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Bezos writes that he offered Shipley, who became head of the opinion section in 2022, the opportunity to oversee this new direction, and Shipley declined. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lj3nxy42b22a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo to staff</a> from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/06/07/will-lewis-washington-post-00162341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embattled</a> WaPo CEO Will Lewis, Lewis thanks Bezos for “clearly and succinctly spelling out what we stand for at The Washington Post, and I will be so very proud for The Post to be known for its two key pillars: our belief in free markets and personal liberties.”</p><p>I would argue that The Washington Post (former employer of Nathan and me) is known for, you know, <em>news</em>, though lately has become known for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/10/10/washington-post-staff-buyouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buyouts</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/business/media/washington-post-president-endorsement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kissing Trump’s ass</a>, with Bezos joining other billionaire <a href="https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech moguls</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5251508/la-times-owner-soon-shiong-rfk-jr-opinion-op-ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newspaper owners</a> in securing his own bag over the paper’s credibility. While Bezos’ ownership of The Post gives him, in the most basic sense, the right to shape some of its strategy as he sees fit, so blatantly spelling out his own priorities and commanding his writers to take them up feels like a massive overstep of his power, and yet another clear signal that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/trump-administration-says-it-will-take-control-of-white-house-press-pool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the free press is crumbling</a> in the face of our new, incredibly stupid regime.</p><p>Legacy outlets like The Post and The New York Times have long held up the fact that their opinion pages are siloed and separate from their news coverage as an excuse to throw all kinds of toxic spaghetti at the wall. While it is true that news and opinion are separate sections, as someone who’s worked at both digital outlets and The Post, I’ve always found this a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lj3nhfj6zc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flimsy</a> justification. Readers raised on digital news are used to their outlets eschewing some of the stodgier legacy practices of “<a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/a-test-of-the-news-wesley-lowery-objectivity.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objectivity</a>” and “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/V/bo29172094.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the view from nowhere,</a>” gravitating toward writers and sites with strong voices who don’t seek to erase their own humanity in pursuit of the news. Sites like those of my Gawker peers, or our colleagues at independent outlets today, are popular because we write like real people who live in the real world, because we don’t feel professionally bound to put our brains and hearts aside in fealty to some neutral “both sides.” That doesn’t mean we don’t hold to journalistic values of truth, fairness, and humanity in our coverage and reporting, but we know the news doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Our sites run “opinion” pieces, but we don’t have opinion sections; we don’t need a special space in which to showcase our values, because they undergird all of our coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps readers trust us, but it also means the younger ones might not be familiar with the structure of newspapers that make hard distinctions between “opinion” and “news.” You could correctly call this a kind of media illiteracy, but I think it also speaks to changing reader expectations, and to the fact that, as much as journalists (myself included) would like to pretend otherwise, most readers aren’t interested in the nitty-gritty structure of a paper and the different journalistic practices, rules, and ethics that go into its sections. Readers want to know what’s going on and want help making sense of it from writers they trust. They won’t see an outlet do hard-hitting, vital investigations and then run <a href="https://glaad.org/the-new-york-times-bias-continues-to-endanger-transgender-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screeds against trans people</a> as fundamentally different things; they will see the whole outlet as morally bankrupt and untrustworthy, and they’ll go get their news elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>That doesn’t mean there isn’t room for a variety of opinions on an outlet’s page, but that an outlet without a consistent moral center, whatever the personal politics of its writers or owner, will alienate readers today. There’s no world where The Post’s opinion section can be the personal mouthpiece of Bezos and his concepts of the “free market” and “personal liberties” and still have readers trust its news output. Whatever the revamped opinion section will be, it will irreparably devalue all the good work The Post’s writers and reporters do in the eyes of readers.</p><p>In his memo to staff, Lewis wrote,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency, and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every day. This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It is indeed transparency into what the paper stands for: Jeff Bezos, and by extension his oligarch cohort, want to be The Washington Post now, and the role of the everyday people who read the paper and support it with their money is to be force-fed the contents of Bezos' head. The “America” and “Americans” Lewis cites aren’t readers the paper respects and serves; they’re grist for the mill of Bezos and his buddies. Even if Bezos never touches the news section, readers will see his hands all over it. This is “News by Jeff” now, no matter how many “opinion” banners the paper slaps up.  &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo"><h3>I Need To Stop Playing The Wheel World Demo And Fix My Bike</h3></a><p>If only real-life wrenching were as fun as it is in the game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Prior to Marvel Rivals, casual superhero fans may have only been familiar with Moon Knight's live-action 2022 Disney+ series starring Oscar Isaac. The Fist of Khonshu first appeared in comics 50 years ago when he went up against Marvel's Werewolf by Night. However, some fans believe that Moon Knight has a grudge against Dracula because of a popular meme, and now even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> is getting in on the fun with some very amusing callbacks in the game.</p><p>The meme in question features artwork from one of Marvel's comics, but the dialogue was reedited to make Moon Knight angry at the lord of the vampires over an unpaid debt. This never happened in Marvel's comics, and Moon Knight hasn't had a lot of interactions with Dracula in-continuity.</p><p>Marvel Rivals continuity isn't bound by that technicality, and NetEase apparently added in a few Easter eggs for the meme in the new map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park, which debuted as part of mid-Season 1 update. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">Dracula is one of the main villains of Season 1</a>, and Moon Knight was one of the first heroes in Marvel Rivals. They haven't crossed paths on-screen yet, but Moon Knight mentions the debt Dracula owes him in the clips below.</p><p>So far, the two specific lines of dialogue that came up for Moon Knight in this map are "Dracula's here? Good, that bloodsuckin' nerd owes me big" and that it's "time for Dracula to pay up." There's also another reference to it in Moon Knight's in-game lore tab. In the text where Moon Knight is conversing with his patron deity, Khonshu, he says that "[vampires] suck" and "Dracula owes me money."</p><p>This lighthearted touch is a welcome discovery after the news about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">NetEase laying off some of Marvel Rivals' developers</a> despite the game's massive success. A recent report even suggested that NetEase considered replacing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">Marvel's characters or canceling the game outright</a> to avoid paying Disney for the rights to use them in the game. Regardless of whether either option was ever a viable choice, Marvel Rivals has already established itself as one of NetEase's most popular titles in a very short time.</p>

                <p>BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk has claimed that Xbox could've had another potential franchise hit in the RPG Jade Empire if it wasn't for Microsoft's short-sighted advice.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4C53o2G7q64HMCeqf54Qyz?si=02ac49c328d34de8&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=526b6e50087f44ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Zeschuk said that Microsoft convinced BioWare to release Jade Empire at the tail-end of the original Xbox's lifecycle. "It was the worst advice; absolute moronic advice from them. The stupidest thing ever," he explained.</p><p>He claimed that Jade Empire should've been an Xbox 360 launch game, which would've made it more successful as a product at the beginning of the console's lifecycle as opposed to the end of the previous console's lifecycle.</p><p>Zeschuk explained that if he had pushed for more development time and money, Jade Empire could've joined the ranks of fabled franchises like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. "Give us six months; give us the chance to make it a launch title for the 360 and we'd have another franchise," he said.</p><p>Jade Empire launched on the original Xbox in April 2005, and the Xbox 360 was released in November 2005. The most recent <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/edmonton-journal/88437678/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimate of the game's sales</a> was back in July 2005, where it crossed 500K units sold, which was below expectations.</p><p>While Jade Empire is backwards compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, there have been no subsequent entries outside of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jade-empire-special-edition-review/1900-6166271/" data-ref-id="1900-6166271">enhanced PC port in 2007</a> and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/biowares-classic-action-rpg-jade-empire-hits-ios/1100-6444254/" data-ref-id="1100-6444254">iOS port in 2016</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/march-2025-ps-plus-games-include-dragon-age-the-veilguard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for March&nbsp; 2025 have been announced and if you bought Dragon Age: The Veilguard just four months ago then you are going to be a bit miffed.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus March 2025 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be March 4th, and they will be available until March 31st.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sonic Colors: Ultimate | PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched on October 31st 2024 with lots of positive reviews, including one from us which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">scored the game 8/10.</a></p>
<p>“The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware,” said Jason in his review. “It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

<p>Since then EA have said the game failed to meet sales expectations and cancelled DLC plans, so it looks like they are trying to rake back a little more cash by getting Sony to pay for it to come to PS Plus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate is rather older and was released way back in 2021.&nbsp; We did not review it but has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-colors-ultimate/">Metacrtic score of 74 o</a>n PS4 so that sounds pretty good to me.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Colors: Ultimate - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3MCqTdsVKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is from 2022 and collects thirteen classic Konami Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games in to one pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-78FD9xvc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our retro expert Adrian <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">reviewed the pack and it also scored 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a must for any Turtles fan,” he said. “The emulation here is flawless and the range of accessibility enhancements is very welcome. In fact, the treasure trove of behind-the-scenes content is worth the asking price alone. Sure, there’s a some ‘classic’ games included that won’t live up to nostalgic memories, but ignore the dross and you’ll have a blast with the near-essential selection of scrolling beat ‘em up TMNT goodness.”</p>

			<p>Today, The Chinese Room has <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-cast-of-mortals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 developer diary dedicated to the game's mortal non-player characters (NPCs). As the World of Darkness Head of Creative Management Karim Muammar puts it, vampires can only be striking if they have a mortal backdrop.&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 will feature several human NPCs who are, however, either knowingly or unknowingly, still entangled with the vampires of Seattle.</p>
<p>For example, Pandora Graves is a young girl that protagonist Phyre will meet in a bar. She knows quite a bit about the Kindred, and yet doesn't appear to realize the danger she's in by putting herself so close to vampires. Then there's Verona De Lancey, the offspring of wealthy parents who decided to come to the big city to search for more excitement. Apparently, she got more than she bargained for, having received a death threat in her handbag after a single night in Seattle.</p>
<p>Dale Beecher, on the other hand, is aware that Kindred society exists but only occasionally crosses paths with them, even though, from the description, he sounds like some kind of alchemist vendor. Biker Guru says he's able to sense ghosts, but seems unfazed by that fact. He can usually be found close to the rest of his biker friends near The Dutchman bar.</p>

<p>Carla was a dedicated paramedic, but she parted ways with her employers after something went wrong in their work relationship. However, she still looks out for the people of Seattle, dispensing medicine on the city's streets. Then there's Reggie, a bum with a philosophical view of the city, how it works, and where he can make a difference. He haunts Pioneer Square and usually has a good idea of what's going on in the streets nearby.</p>
<p>Marigold is a familiar figure on the streets near Atrium. She's been conducting her trade with passers-by for a long time and now also offers fortune-telling through astrology. Shelby was a trader in a major financial organization until six months ago when she received a revelation. Now, she walks the streets of uptown Seattle, making sure everyone is well aware of the coming rapture, although, according to her, there's nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Wheeler is a trustworthy officer of the Seattle Police Department. However, he has problems with his memory from time to time and is aware that things aren't quite the way they should be. Lastly, Mr. Lemon is a drunkard who has been in the Seattle Police Department's drunk-tank for a few days now and still hasn’t sobered up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Dev Diary #27 - Mortals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRqWPYYIUbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to The Chinese Room, players will influence the lives of all these mortal NPCs (and more) in one way or another when going through Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The next developer diary is scheduled in two weeks and will focus on Hunters. The game is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch this year</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Before you even get to control your character in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a>, you've already fucked up. Alta has lost in the arena, her defeat a swift and ignoble end to three years as unbeaten champion. She is, in her own words, a ruinous "failure". To retrain and come back fiercer than ever, she pops into the forest looking for a legendary trainer, only to find herself waking up exhausted in front of a picturesque tea shop. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam demo</a> that follows will see you harvesting plants, making tea, and arguing a lot with the shop's owner, a gentle giant who thinks that maybe what Alta really needs is just some time to rest. After all, you can't fail at drinking a cuppa.

<p>
The demo (released as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>) is basically the opening of the game, heavy on the story and introducing our hamstrung hero and her new friend Boro, the hulking optimist who owns a tea shop but is basically a giant therapist. I want to talk about the character-driven storytelling more than the gamey stuff you'll be doing day to day around the tea shop. But I think it's helpful to know what kind of cosiness you're in for, so let's quickly summarise the basics.
</p>
<p>
You're making tea, but that includes all the farming involved before the first flush. The small field outside the shop is arranged in a hex pattern, and you can sow seeds in certain patterns to instantly bloom different types of plant. Sow in a line to get a small hybrid plant with blue seeds. Sow those same seeds in a three-point star pattern to create a large hybrid that'll offer harvestable fruit for the teas. 
</p>
<p>
You'll dry tea-leaves in a box with a timer, collect the resulting tea balls, and clamber up a giant central tea infusion machine, sliding about on ladders, pulling ropes and puffing bellows and kicking levers to get the hot water flowing. The tea spills out a spiral funnel in the bottom with the pleasing flow of a chemistry set you got for Christmas. There is something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc9h6FC6QgU">very Dick Van Dyke</a> about the internal decor of the house. Little toy trains wheel in and out of waterfalls and heaters - a washing machine for tea cups. Automatic saloon doors open the way from room to room with a satisfying creak. You can tune some knobs to change the music playing in the shop. The radio has three stations: "horse", "dog", and "cow".

<p>
This is all very cosy and rosy, but what does it have to do with failure, and how we cope with the idea of it? Well, most of what's on show is not selling the game itself but the protagonist and her problems. Alta has been pushing herself past the point of terrible burnout. She runs back into the forest again and again to escape the tea shop, using anger and fear as a fuel source, not yet understanding that such fuel burns hot and fast and pumps out poison like any petrol-hungry combustion engine. She eventually collapses every time you leave the tea shop's restful glade.

And playing this opening I can see what they mean. The core struggles Alta faces are difficulties a lot of us can relate to. At one point she talks about a previous dream - to smithy her own sword. But she gave up on the idea because to be "great" at blacksmithing would take a lifetime in itself, and nothing but the best-made sword would do. In Alta's mind, she only had enough life for one goal: to be the greatest arena fighter.

<p>
This is a kind of all-or-nothing thinking any perfectionist will recognise, and one that can lead to despair as easily as it leads to success. Pouring the entirety of your life's efforts into one vessel at the expense of all others comes naturally to those who want to specialise and excel. A lot of us (I include myself here) have funneled a life and identity into the mental coffee cup that accompanies us to work every day. But when something goes wrong and that career cup shatters, for whatever reason, the cold caffeine stains of "failure" seep into everything around you. Suddenly, after years of over-achieving, you're a fuck-up. There are two reactions: double down and try harder, or give up entirely. All or nothing.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, there's a lot of emotional baggage to unpack in Wanderstop, even in this short demo. When it ended after an hour or so, I was left thirsty for more. I want to see Alta get better because I know the restorative value of taking a horse-sized chill pill and learning to sit down and do nothing but breathe air for an hour at a time. I have learned that there is something - lots of things - between "all" and "nothing". And I'd feel warm and fuzzy if this extremely angry man stabber comes to see this too. 
</p>
<p>
I'm also looking forward to how the game will interrogate the "cosy" farming genre, which is traditionally replete with crafting cogs and seasonal deadlines that easily turn otherwise relaxing games into yet more efficiency-driven taskbox ticking. If the goal here is to show Alta that she doesn't need to always push herself, doesn't need to be "productive" all the time, then I'm keen to see how the game design reinforces that idea. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> and its ilk are great distractions, a green-thumbed escape from daily concerns. But there has long been room for a game to come along and think more deeply about why those games are so popular. Exactly what are we trying to escape when we plant another row of parsnips? I'm hopeful Wanderstop has an interesting answer. It's due out March 11th.

I was personally feeling pretty good in early December when I had most of the Genetic Apex launch set finished, outside of some super rare cards. Then Mythical Island dropped later that month, followed by Space-Time Smackdown in late January. My virtual card binder is now full of holes, and Triumphant Light will only make that worse. </p><figure id="" data-id="e4d930350e08c4e16c292ba285d34e99" data-recommend-id="image://e4d930350e08c4e16c292ba285d34e99" data-format="png" data-width="1034" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a Pokemon TCG Pocket leak on Reddit.

It definitely doesn’t seem fake, but I share the rest of the sentiment. I’ve fallen off <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> pretty hard in recent weeks, in part because it feels like my pulls in  Space-Time Smackdown have been demonstrably worse on average than when the game first came out. I’m not getting as many of those dopamine bursts from finding rare cards, and my list of Wonder Picks to choose from has been pretty garbage too. </p><p>Maybe a better battle meta can fix some of that malaise.

Competitive play has been requested since launch, and it would certainly give players something new to grind for, especially if there are decent rewards for hitting new ranks besides just bragging rights or trophy emblems.

Up to this point, Psychic decks have ruled the roost. Mewtwo ex, combined with the Energy generation of Gardevoir, inflicted such high burst damage that it held fast as one of the game’s most dangerous cards since launch.

Meanwhile, the once-feared Mewtwo ex had dropped to merely 2.1 percent. Darkrai ex’s rise to prominence isn’t because it hits hard or has a ton of HP—instead, it’s how it fits into the ways Space-Time Smackdown has changed the competitive landscape of the game, rendering many previously viable strategies borderline obsolete.</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here, so check out our breakdown below to understand just why Darkrai ex has spiked so hard in popularity.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: No matter how much I may or may not hype up any cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, I <em>do not </em>encourage you to spend money on the game, even if you have cash to spare. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">This is a gacha game at its core</a></span>, and with that comes aggressive psychological manipulation to encourage you to spend more than you normally would.

Whenever you place a Dark Energy from your Energy Zone on Darkrai ex, it will immediately inflict 20 damage on your opponent’s active Pokémon. Because this is an <em>ability</em> and not an <em>attack</em>, this will bypass damage reduction effects like Melmetal’s Hard Coat ability or counterattacks like Druddigon’s Rough Skin. <strong>Most importantly, Nightmare Aura works while Darkrai ex is on the bench</strong>. This means that, with the right setup, Darkrai ex can consistently boost your damage output by 20 per turn. That might not sound like a lot, but when cards like Giovanni can completely change the tide of a game by adding 10 damage to a single attack, you can imagine how Darkrai ex can swing matches in your favor.</p><p>Yet as mentioned above, Darkrai ex itself is only a small slice of why it’s so widely used. It’s how it synergizes with Space-Time Smackdown’s new Trainer Cards that make it so evil.</p><figure id="" data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h37423"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Trainer Cards to use with Darkrai ex</strong></h2><p>Two new Trainer Cards in particular elevate Darkrai ex to especially dangerous heights. The first of these is <strong>Dawn</strong>, which lets you transfer one Energy from your benched Pokémon to your active Pokémon. <strong>It’s a useful card in isolation, but also a fantastic tool if you want to activate Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability from the bench <em>and </em>build up your active pokemon so it can attack too</strong>. This pairs especially well with low Energy cards like Weezing and Weavile ex, both of which require only one Energy to attack.</p><p>The biggest game-changer, though, is <strong>Cyrus</strong>. In fact, <strong>Cyrus is arguably <em>the</em> most meta-shifting card in Space-Time Smackdown, even beyond Darkrai ex</strong>. The way it works is simple: if your opponent has a Pokémon on their bench that has taken damage, you can swap it to the active slot. Prior to Space-Time Smackdown’s release, decks loaded with ex cards thrived because players could retreat strategically. After all, it doesn’t matter if ex cards are worth two points upon being knocked out if you can deny your opponent the chance to finish them off. Now that dynamic is turned on its head; if your opponent has an ex Pokémon with low health on their bench, you can plan on claiming those two points the moment you draw a Cyrus.</p><figure id="" data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, attacking a weak benched monster wasn’t <em>impossible </em>before. Cyrus just makes it a <em>lot </em>easier, and it slots into any deck.</p><p>Darkrai ex’s synergy with Cyrus is two-fold. On one hand, it allows you to use Cyrus on an opponent’s Pokémon with only 10 to 20 HP remaining, knock it out with Nightmare Aura, and then use your active Pokémon’s attack on whoever your opponent decides to switch in afterwards. Conversely, <strong>because Darkrai ex is ideally kept on the bench until the late game, it isn’t as vulnerable to a surprise Cyrus switch-in</strong>. Keep it at full health on your bench, make sure you have at least one other Pokémon in reserve in case your opponent has Sabrina, and wait until you’re already down two points before putting Darkrai ex in to clean up the rest of the game.</p><p>Caption: An image of the Giant Cape Pokémon Tool Trainer Card from <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>.</p><p>This isn’t even getting into the new <strong>Pokémon Tool </strong>cards, which can be equipped on Pokémon to either boost their max HP or inflict damage on opponents when they attack. Both of these effects favor tactics that stall the game and encourage chip damage, which Darkrai ex fits into perfectly. You have a perfect storm of ways that Darkrai ex decks can sweep the floor with virtually any opponent.</p><h2 id="h37424"><a id=""></a><strong>Darkrai ex fits into virtually any dark-type deck</strong></h2><p>Darkrai ex is one of the first Dark-type ex cards added to the game, and I’d go as far as to say it makes any Dark-type deck better. Whether you use it with Weezing, Weavile ex, or even Arbok, it adds so much to your team and leaves very little room for your opponent to exploit it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
