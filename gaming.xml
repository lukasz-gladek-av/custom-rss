<p>Available later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has announced a new event for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, introducing a special collaboration with <strong>Banshee's Last Cry</strong>, the obscure Super Famicom visual novel from 1994.</p>
<p>Players can access the new content via the World Tour mode by selecting the 'Street Fighter's Last Cry' option from the 'One Fateful Day' menu. What's even better is that this new content will seemingly be a permanent addition, and will be available even after the collab period ends.</p>
<p>Those who do join in the fun during the official period, however, will be able to bag exclusive items relating to the collaboration. That period is <strong>15h - 30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, we've got some spooky scenes with accompanying text to pay homage to the original Banshee's Last Cry, while the character models are also heavily influenced by the basic, blue design from the 1994 game.</p>
<p>It's a weird little addition, but we'll take it!</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 will also gain a new character in the form of C.Viper later this month as part of the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass. Alex and Ingrid will also join the ranks at a later date.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-14tb-external-hard-drive-selling-for-just-170-may-be-the-last-one-you-ever-need-to-buy-2000632682</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/at-just-1-cent-per-gb-wd-14tb-external-hard-drive-is-practically-free-storage.1319500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone of a certain age remembers being absolutely blown away when the first 100GB hard drives hit the market in the early 2000s. <em>So much space</em> — how could we possibly fill it? Today you would need several of those 100GB hard drives — 1,400 of them, to be precise — to equal the immense capacity of this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">Western Digital Elements 14TB external hard drive that’s selling on Amazon right now for just $170 in a killer Prime Day deal.</a></p>
<p>Care for a little more future shock? Those first 100GB external hard drives sold for around $275 when they were released in 2002. So the 14TB of storage space in this $170 Western Digital desktop drive would have cost you roughly $385,000 not <em>all</em> that long ago. Still wondering how good of a deal this one is?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge, Fast, Safe</h2>
<p>All of that vast space on this WD Elements drive would be only minimally useful if the drive was slow — imagine how many days it would take to move 14 terabytes of data on or off of a pokey drive. But this one has a USB 3.0 interface (also works with USB 2.0) for speedy data transfers. It’s plug-and-play for Windows computers, and getting it ready for a Mac requires only a quick and simple formatting.</p>
<p>The drive itself isn’t pocket-sized like so many of the external hard drives we see today — it’s <em>fourteen terabytes</em> — so expectations should be modulated. But it’s a sleek-looking black device that resembles a book when standing on your desk at a modest 6.53 inches tall, 1.89 inches wide, and 5.31 inches deep. It does require an AC power source, but beyond that, the included USB cable is all you need.</p>



<h2>Who’s This For?</h2>
<p>Better question: Who <em>isn’t</em> this for? Reliable backup storage is a critical need for anyone who has sensitive or valuable files on their laptop or desktop, and that’s basically everyone who owns a computer. It’s beyond inadvisable to not have some form of backup system in place, and the WD Elements drive is almost certainly big enough to back up every single computer in your home. It’s especially valuable if you’ve converted irreplaceable files like family photos or home movies to video format and need to have a safe place to keep them.</p>
<p>When everything else seems to skyrocket in price over time thanks to inflation, it’s good to see something as valuable as digital storage go in the opposite direction. Even so, this Amazon Prime Day deal on the 14TB Western Digital Elements USB 3.0 external hard drive is borderline ridiculous. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">At 39% off, it’s just $170 for more space than you’ll probably ever need.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it.1319494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2XKO is out in early access, bringing with it seasonal content, two new characters in Teemo and Warwick, and a suite of cosmetics for players to unlock and buy. As a free-to-play game this isn't unusual, however the game's most expensive bundle has some players wincing.</p>
<p>The reason why comes down to the cost. 2XKO's Arcane-themed Ultra Starter Edition is available to buy for $99.99 / €99.99 / £84.99 / CA $139.99. Now, that's a lot of money, but for that amount you get three "Mythic" tier skins with a bunch of alternate colours, an exclusive finisher, eight champion unlock tokens, a player card, avatar cosmetic bundles, and 5,000 KO points (in-game currency). </p>
<p>It's worth noting that this is the price of the most expensive version of the bundle. The standard version of the starter bundle costs $29.99 and comes with four champion unlock tokens, a player card, and enough in-game currency to buy one legendary skin from the shop. However, if you want those Arcane skins, you'll have to fork out the full price. There is no other way to get them, you'll have to pay for the Ultra version.</p>

<p>The reaction online from fighting game players seeing this has been passionate to say the least. <a href="https://x.com/vicwingly/status/1975626557306835417">Some have expressed shock at the bundle's price</a>, others <a href="https://x.com/Spideraxe30/status/1975660887055683867">are expressing disappointment that they aren't able to buy the Arcane skins separately from the bundle itself</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimeBombFanatic/status/1975780591242219776">while some are totally fine with spending that much money on these fancy cosmetics</a>.</p><p>It's an interesting twist on an ongoing point of discussion within the fighting game genre. Dedicated players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jan/06/sf6-costumes-silence-displeasure/">have been begging for more consistent character skin releases to support the game</a>, rather than the onslaught of Battle Hub cosmetics that game has received since launch.</p>
<p>For many fighting game players 2XKO is their introduction to modern free-to-play microtransaction models, and as eye-watering as $99.99 is to see pop up on your screen, it's not an alien concept to Riot Games. The company has been supporting Valorant with expensive gun skins ever since that shooter's launch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> has been experimenting with gacha and super-expensive Ahri and Jhin skins.</p>
<p>The question is, is this bundle worth it? Well, an obvious point to make first is that some people will simply not be able to afford $100 for an in-game bundle regardless of its value proposition. For those who can, a lot of the value comes down to how much you like the exclusive Arcane skins. I, for example, don't care for Vi, Jinx, or Ekko, so it's not much of a prize.</p>
<p>The in-game currency you get as part of the Ultra version of the bundle comes to about 2.5 legendary skins in the shop, or you can grab the Ultra version of the current battle pass and be left with 1,500 KO points left. These skins <em>are</em> cool, and the battle pass is full of all manner of quirky customisation options, but again you're contesting with the $100 shock factor here. Also, funnily enough, your remainging 1,500 points if you choose to buy the battle pass isn't quite enough for a legendary skin, so you'll have to buy more premium currency to use up what you've got left in your 2XKO wallet, at the expense of your real-world wallet.</p><p>Ultimately there's not too much you can do to tear away the shock of a $100 price point on any in-game bundle, but those in favour of this price point will of course argue it's not meant to be bought by everyone. It's meant to be an illustrious expense for super fans (or whales). This is true of course, but with three more bundles set to release before 2026, one has to wonder how much money people will have to spend to get everything Riot is selling here.</p>

<p>Starseekers Unite!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've already had a very brief glimpse of System Era Softworks and Devolver Digital's rather excellent-looking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker Astroneer Expeditions</a> during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Switch 2 Direct</a> six months back, and now the game has gone and got itself a great big 17-minute gameplay reveal, so we can get a proper look at exactly what it entails.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal video in full above, and following on from our initial excitement at what we gleaned from our first glance back in April (no thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/devolvers-awesome-new-games-got-lost-during-the-dodgy-switch-2-livestream">livestream hiccups</a>), this in-depth peek shows off a multiplayer space adventure that's got real promise.</p>
<p>The hook in Starseeker, you see, is all about getting together with other players, kicking off aboard the titular Starseeker ship before getting ready to drop out onto alien planets where, we assume, death dressed as many varieties of interstellar comedy awaits.</p>
<p>Of course, being a sequel to the also-very-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/astroneer">Astroneer</a>, the game keeps the series' signature graphical style, although it does seem to have a lot more detail overall in the footage on show. We're also getting some heavy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/journey_to_the_savage_planet">Savage Planet</a> vibes from the colourful and goofy look of the planets on which players bound around and zap stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some further information about all of the gameplay aspects that you can check out in the vid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recruits begin their journey on the ESS Starseeker, an experimental space station packed with tools, supplies and the questionable leadership of the famous Action Science Hero superteam, the Fronteer Force. Players can set out solo or in a Squad with up to three friends, preparing their loadouts before diving into timed missions across alien worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Step One</strong> – Gear up. Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger cooperative missions."</p>
</blockquote>

						<h5>Razer BlackShark V3 Pro </h5><p><span>July 29, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Type</h5><p><span>Wireless gaming headset</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Razer’s expertise in delivering high-performance gaming peripherals is evident in the BlackShark V3 Pro for Xbox, <a href="https://www.razer.com/newsroom/product-news/razer-launches-blackshark-v3-pro/?srsltid=AfmBOooV7LJUHOwVyxWb28UdRB4GpiQilTb_t8U0JvNkrkufpx7c700x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> back in July of this year. Priced at $269.99, it’s a premium option compared to the less expensive BlackShark V3, designed with Xbox-specific features like green-stitched earcups and seamless integration with Xbox Series X|S. Notably, this Xbox model also supports PlayStation consoles, unlike the PlayStation version, making it the ideal choice for gamers with both platforms. After extensive testing in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon</a>, the headset delivers reliable, high-quality audio tailored for competitive and immersive gaming.</p>



<p><strong>Design</strong></p>



<p>The BlackShark V3 Pro features a sleek matte black design with subtle Xbox-green accents, maintaining a professional aesthetic without excessive RGB lighting. Its aviation-inspired yoke system, enhanced for durability compared to the V2 Pro, connects oval earcups with adjustable metal hinges for a comfortable, customized fit. Weighing 367 grams, it’s lightweight for extended use. Swappable magnetic faceplates allow for personalization, and the earcups swivel 45 degrees for convenient resting during breaks.</p>



<p>Two practical details stand out: the volume knob on the left earcup is smooth and precise, easily located without looking, enabling quick adjustments during gameplay. Similarly, the textured power button is distinctively ridged, ensuring it’s easy to find without confusion with other controls like the Game/Chat mix roller. Voice prompts for mode changes further enhance usability, creating a streamlined and intuitive design.</p>







<p><strong>Features</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro offers a robust feature set for Xbox and PlayStation gamers. Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless Gen-2 provides a low 10ms latency over 2.4GHz, ensuring responsive audio for fast-paced titles like Call of Duty. Bluetooth 5.3 enables simultaneous device pairing for music or calls, with USB-C or 3.5mm wired options as a backup. A key advantage is its cross-platform compatibility: the Xbox version works on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles, while the PlayStation model is limited to Sony’s ecosystem. This makes the Xbox variant the better choice for multi-console households.</p>



<p>Windows Sonic spatial audio on Xbox and Tempest 3D AudioTech on PlayStation deliver immersive 3D soundscapes, enhancing directional awareness in games like Gears 5. The Razer Audio app (mobile) and Synapse 4 (for PC cross-play) provide a 10-band EQ with nine onboard presets, including 12 pro-tuned profiles for games like Apex Legends and Valorant. Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), powered by four microphones, reduces low-frequency noise like household appliances by 77%, though it falls slightly short of top-tier competitors. The detachable 12mm HyperClear Full Band boom mic, with 48kHz sampling and noise rejection, ensures clear voice communication.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro excels in delivering precise audio. In Halo Infinite, footsteps and weapon sounds are distinct, enabling quick reactions. In Forza Horizon, engine notes and environmental sounds are well-balanced, driven by TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers (12-28,000Hz response). These produce clear mids, detailed highs, and controlled bass, with minor EQ adjustments smoothing any treble sharpness. Latency is imperceptible, ensuring audio aligns perfectly with on-screen action on both Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>ANC effectively minimizes background noise, aiding focus, and Bluetooth multipoint switching between console and phone is seamless for communication apps. The headset adapts professional-grade audio for console gaming, offering versatility across platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Sound Quality</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro’s audio performance is a highlight, delivering clarity and depth that cater to both competitive and immersive gaming. The TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers produce a balanced soundstage, with impactful bass that gives explosions and engine roars in Forza Horizon a satisfying weight without overpowering subtler elements. Midrange frequencies are clear and well-defined, ensuring dialogue in story-driven titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> remains articulate and natural, even during chaotic action sequences. Highs are crisp, capturing delicate cues like the rustle of grass or distant gunfire in Call of Duty, which is critical for pinpointing enemy positions in competitive play.</p>



<p>The default tuning leans toward FPS precision, emphasizing directional audio for tactical advantage, but it’s versatile enough for other genres. For instance, in open-world games, the headset renders expansive environmental soundscapes with impressive detail, from the chirping of birds to the hum of distant machinery. A slight treble emphasis can occasionally feel sharp during extended sessions, but the Razer Audio app’s 10-band EQ allows fine-tuning to soften this for music or cinematic experiences. Distortion is minimal even at high volumes, ensuring long-term listening comfort. While not audiophile-grade, the V3 Pro’s audio fidelity is among the best in its class, striking a balance between competitive clarity and immersive richness.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>



<p>After extended sessions of playing various titles, the V3 Pro’s breathable cloth-wrapped memory foam earcups (66x45mm) and padded headband remain comfortable without excessive pressure. The swivel accommodates various head shapes, and the lightweight design reduces fatigue. A minor drawback: the yoke may feel slightly loose on smaller heads during rapid movement, though this rarely impacts focused gameplay.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>



<p>Razer claims a 48-hour battery life, and testing with ANC, high volume, and Bluetooth use yielded 42 hours. The hot-swappable battery allows uninterrupted play with a spare, and a full USB-C charge takes under three hours, supporting extended gaming sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro for Xbox is a refined, high-performance headset. At $249.99, it’s a premium investment, but its precise audio, clear microphone, intuitive volume knob, and distinct power button deliver exceptional value. Unlike the PlayStation model, it is compatible with both Xbox and PlayStation, making it a standout for multi-platform gamers. The Xbox version is thus a strong choice for those seeking a reliable, versatile headset that elevates competitive and immersive gaming.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-hdd-is-going-for-pennies-at-amazon-now-only-0-01-per-gb-of-external-storage-2000633124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-hdd-is-going-for-pennies-at-amazon-now-only-0-01-per-gb-of-external-storage.1319476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Long-term storage of photos and videos creates a dilemma that most people solve expensively through monthly cloud subscriptions or by purchasing fast but pricey SSDs. Here’s the reality: <strong>you don’t need blazing transfer speeds for archiving memories</strong> you’ll access occasionally. What you need is massive capacity at a reasonable price, and traditional hard disk drives deliver exactly that value proposition.</p>
<p>The Seagate 20TB external drive gives you an enormous amount of space for storing years worth of family photos and backup files without the recurring costs of cloud storage or the premium pricing of solid-state alternatives. Prime Big Deal Day <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">has slashed this drive to $229 from its original $499 price, representing more than 50% off and creating an all-time low for this capacity</a>. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight when Amazon’s promotional event closes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Practical Storage for Archives</h2>
<p>Smartphones today capture 4K video that takes up gigabytes per minute and high-def photos from today’s cameras easily surpass 25MB per shot. A week-long family vacation can amass 100GB of content before you know it. With 20TB at your disposal, you get <strong>storage for approximately 5 million average-sized photos</strong>&nbsp;or about 2,500 hours of Full HD video.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 interface<strong> reads transfer rates of around 120-160 MB/s</strong> when dealing with sequential file operations which means that you can transfer a 100GB folder in around 10-15 minutes. It will feel slow compared to today’s SSDs reaching 1,000 MB/s or faster, remember your actual use case scenario: you’re performing large one-time moves of photo libraries or full-system backups, then plugging the drive into the machine or storing the drive securely.</p>



<p>The mechanical hard disk technology on the inside is mature, tried and tested storage that’s been perfected over decades. HDDs can’t compete with the shock resistance and speed of SSDs, but they provide <strong>exponentially better cost per gigabyte for the very biggest capacities</strong>. They’re therefore perfect for write-once, read-occasionally data such as photo archives or system backups you hope never to have to use but like to keep on hand should disaster befall you.</p>



<p>Seagate includes <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> on this drive which provides professional data recovery assistance should the drive fail mechanically. This is the salvation of potentially thousands of dollars’ worth of irreplaceable videos and images that will be forever lost without it. A limited warranty is also included and offers another type of protection that will provide you with redress should hardware issues occur during the course of the coverage.</p>
<p>Data management effectiveness is derived from the presence of sufficient storage to accommodate appropriate backup strategies. The 3-2-1 rule is one that recommends that you have three copies of critical data with two on distinct types of media and one off-site. This 2<strong>0TB unit can be your local primary backup as you keep working files on the internal drive on your computer</strong> and potentially keep significant things in selective cloud storage.</p>
<p>For $229 as part of a 20TB bundle, you’re shelling out approximately 1.1 cents per gigabyte which is one of the lowest methods through which you can archive giant data libraries. Note, <strong>this Prime Big Deal Day deal ends tonight</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the most satisfying games ever to release is receiving a sequel, with the release of Powerwash Simulator 2 rapidly approaching, and we’ve got all the details on its Game Pass inclusion status.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 23</a>, Powerwash Simulator 2 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released exclusively on current-gen consoles</a>, and is set to offer hours of calm cleaning as you tackle the toughest dirt there is around.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, Powerwash Simulator 2 is available as a day-one launch on select Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</strong></p>



<p>Powerwash Simulator 2 will be available to play as soon as it launches with the service, though different tiers of subscription provide different games. While it’s yet to be confirmed, we’re expecting it to only be available on day one with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>For those with a Premium membership, Powerwash Simulator 2 may be added to the service in future, but it’s not a first-party Xbox title, meaning it’s not guaranteed to come within the first year of launch.</p>

<p><strong>A Game Pass membership is required to play Powerwash Simulator 2 on the service, while the game also needs to be downloaded onto your console and ready to go—though it may be available via the Play Anywhere feature.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not yet confirmed what tier of the service is required to be able to play Powerwash Simulator 2 with a subscription, though the recent changes to the service indicate that it will likely be an Ultimate membership that’s required, with the service recently receiving a price bump.</p>

            <p>If you're reading this, then you're probably one of the "hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players" keeping the games industry going.</p>
<p>That's because, according to research by analyst firm Circana, around a third of video game players in the US buy a new game less than once a year.</p>
<p>While this research is specific to the US, it's certainly eye-opening for the state of the industry across the globe. And with 12 percent purchasing once a year and 18 percent purchasing once every six months, it means a combined 63 percent of players buy just two games or fewer each year.</p>
<p>The research is part of Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games survey, as shared on social media by analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>

If, on average, players are spending, say, £140 on two full price games (or less) each year, is spending around £275 a year (£22.99 for 12 months) on Game Pass Ultimate for access to day one games really a good deal?</p><p>Nowadays there are more games than ever being released, but if players are only buying a couple - and let's face it, it'll be the likes of EA FC, Call of Duty, and inevitably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - how can smaller studios expect to survive?</p>
<p>And that's outside of free-to-play live-service games, where just a handful of games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">continue to dominate player time</a>.</p>
<p>It would seem the 14 percent of players purchasing at least one game each month are the ones keeping the industry afloat at present, but this is by no means an infinite pool of money for studios to aim for. It's why growth of the industry has stagnated in recent years - it's those average players who need to be reached.</p>
<p>For the "hyper enthusiast" players, then, subscriptions like Game Pass offer good value - although not ownership. But how can that be made more attractive to the average consumer?</p>
<p>It certainly helps to explain Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/every-screen-is-an-xbox-microsoft-reportedly-tells-staff">"Everything is an Xbox" approach</a>, to lower the barrier of entry for the average consumer. It's also why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-launching-completely-redesigned-luna-streaming-service-later-this-year-with-emphasis-on-social-gaming">Amazon is now looking to boost its Luna cloud gaming service</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve always been enamoured by the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the RoundTable. I blame Disney. Ever since watching the animated classic ‘Sword in the Stone’ I was a full-on überfan. King Arthur T-shirts, a Guinevere action figure, Lancelot emblazoned underwear, a plastic Excalibur with light-up glow-in-the-dark action (AA batteries supplied separately), heck, I even wrote slightly questionable fanfiction. Well, no, not really. But I still really like the Arthurian Legends, so when the opportunity to review Sworn, a roguelite inspired by near-forgotten British legends, I leapt at the chance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sworn - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NLltDX7dbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sworn wears its devoted inspiration to Hades rather obviously on its armour-clad sleeve. Just like Supergiant’s genre defining classic, Sworn is an action-RPG played from an isometric perspective. In an attempt to differ itself, Sworn asks you to press slightly different button inputs to dodge, attack, and open doors to new areas, yet otherwise this is, to all intents and purposes, a near identical experience, just set in British mythology rather than that of Ancient Greece.</p>


<p>I also get the feeling that someone on the dev team might have read Amy Jeff’s brilliant book Storyland: A New Mythology of Britain at some point, as Sworn draws heavily upon the mythological characters and their stories depicted within it. The Fae Lords – modern interpretations of ancient Celtic gods – bestow powers and abilities on your nameless protagonists, giving you the standard assortment of roguelite powers – flame generating dashes, magical projectiles, elemental attacks, you know the drill – before you die and lose them all. You’ll take on a host of grotesque beasties, before ultimately battling several corrupted members of the Knights of the Round Table, on your way to face Arthur himself.</p>


<p>The game looks fantastic, offering chunky character art and bold visuals clearly inspired by the work of comic-book artist Mike Mignola. Animation is slick and the controls responsive, ensuring it plays well too. Enemies are delightfully varied but often dumb as a poorly educated brick, getting stuck on terrain or hanging out in the corner of a stage, just waiting to die. Still, with a focus on swarming the player, they do enough to offer a decent challenge, even though it’s usually the tougher than tough bosses who will end your run.</p>
<p>There are a few elements that aren’t taken directly from Hades. First and foremost is online co-op, where up to four players can team up to hack through the monster-filled rooms together. This is tremendous – if rather chaotic – fun, though its all too easy to lose sight of your avatar in the unfolding violence and discover you’ve lost a heavy chunk of health. One can only hope that a local co-op mode is in the works, as I certainly missed its inclusion here.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are unlockable player characters which, whilst sharing in the same run-to-run stat upgrades, each play significantly differently. Indeed, working with other players to ensure a rounded team is vital; someone attacking from afar with an archer, whilst another absorbs damage as a knight, until the axe-wielding warrior can get in close to deal out the big hits. The range of meaningful build options is particularly impressive, each character having access to a choice of four varied weapons and numerous additional support spells and abilities.</p>

<p>As such, no matter the seemingly unstoppable might of the boss you are facing, there is always a work around, always something new to try, tempting you with that ‘just one more run’ compulsion. When you gather together a band of four players, these build options across the team increase exponentially, offering some truly devious combos that can see heavyweight foes annihilated in seconds. Part of the satisfaction is the sense that you’re almost breaking the game, up until you reach the next boss and are brought promptly down to earth.</p>
<p>The game is built around co-op, which unfortunately means that in singleplayer, things feel flat and basic. This isn’t helped by the lack of characterisation amongst the NPCs. In Hades, you became increasingly fond of Achilles, Nyx, and Patroclus – and the rest – as their personalities and back story were developed run to run. Indeed, it was one of the reasons I felt compelled to give every nasty boss fight another go; just to further develop my relationship with the gang back in the hub. This element is oddly absent from Sworn.</p>
<p>The developers have some absolutely awesome mythological characters at their disposal, Merlin and Guinevere chief amongst them. But rather than lean into these fascinating figures and their incredible back stories, not to mention the narrative opportunities that would provide, each character you meet is essentially nothing more than a dull merchant, offering power-ups instead of a fully rounded personality and intriguing dialogue. When you have a mythological world as rich as the one provided by the legends of Camelot, this can’t help but feel like a waste.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-the-no-mercy-campaign-with-rtx-remix.1319449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, the so-called Nostalgia Drive Team released the first work-in-progress build of Left 4 Dead RTX NTD. This is based on the previous work done by modder xoxor4d, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>The Nostalgia Drive Team describes Left 4 Dead RTX NTD as a visual overhaul of Valve's classic co-op first-person shooter game released in 2009, rebuilt with the NVIDIA RTX Remix platform (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-1-2-advanced-path-traced-particle-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got a major update last month</a>, allowing modders to inject old games with enhanced fire and smoke effects through a path traced particle system). This fan-made visual revamp focuses specifically on the No Mercy campaign and reimagines its environments with high-resolution physically based rendering (PBR) materials, improved reflections, and manually recreated lighting to achieve a cinematic and atmospheric look.</p>



<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full PBR material system</li>



<li>Manually re-lit scenes (RTX Remix cannot capture native lights)</li>



<li>Enhanced shadows, reflections, and surface roughness</li>



<li>Upgraded materials for buildings, interiors, and props</li>



<li>4K texture rebuilds and improved normal maps</li>



<li>Full RTX Remix runtime compatibility</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can download the WIP build of Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NTD, which weighs 7.15GB, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/left-4-dead-2-rtx-by-nostalgia-drive-team/downloads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-wip-build" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from ModDB</a>. However, the NTD team shared the following warnings and disclaimers:</p>



<p><em>This is not a complete remaster but a foundation for future RTX mods in terms of compatibility and visuals. Due to engine limitations and ongoing development, some assets may appear unfinished or darker.</em></p>



<p><em>Expect missing/dark skyboxes, rubber-like materials on some models, incomplete lighting setups, water surfaces that may look off, and CPU-heavy performance on animated meshes. Moreover, the renderer is currently forced to run single-threaded, Alpha foliage heavily impacts performance, software skinning causes CPU bottlenecks, and some effects are still unhandled or inaccurate.</em></p>



<p>If, on the other hand, you want to contribute to the project, the Nostalgia Drive Team seeks help in the following areas: materials, lighting, assets, and testing. Those interested in joining the team can contact the user Entity in the official RTX Remix Showcase Discord channel.</p>

            <p>The classic 1999 version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> is set to be pulled from sale on Steam later this week. It'll still be kicking around, but as a freebie offered to owners of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-edition">25th anniversary remaster</a>, rather than something you can buy separately on Valve's store.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>System Shock 2 (1999) will be delisted from PC platforms on October 10, 2025," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/866570/view/542243728060844444?l=english">notice</a> Atari have pinned to the FPS/RPG about Von Braun corridor wandering's Steam page. "Existing owners of System Shock 2 (1999) will still be able to re-download and play it from their library, but new users will no longer be able to purchase System Shock 2 (1999) as a standalone product."</p>
<p>Going forwards, anyone who has already bought or buys the System Shock 2 25th anniversary remaster will be able to grab the original game for free. So, it's not going away completely. However, by joining the two at the hip, Atari have gotten rid of the option to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2_1999/">pay just £6.99/$9.99/€9.99</a> to play the original, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">£23.99/$29.99/€28.99 remaster</a> now being the sole port of call as far as Steam goes.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that at least for now, the original version of System Shock 2 is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock_2">still for sale on GOG</a>. There's no indication on the page that it's also set to be taken down imminently and it's part of GOG's preservation program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 25th anniversary it's been lumped in with on Steam got plenty of positive reviews when it debuted earlier this year, with one of them being long-time RPS contributor Rick Lane's verdict for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-review">Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In short, System Shock 2 remains great, but its star has dimmed slightly over the last quarter-century, revealing brighter celestial bodies in the process. Nonetheless, if you like your shooters brainy, your levels knotty, and your nightmares weird as hell, System Shock 2 still delivers in a way that's more accessible than ever thanks to Nightdive's sterling work.</blockquote>
<p>If you're still on the fence about Nightdive's fresh coat of paint, it's probably wise to grab the 1999 version in the next couple of days if you're certain it's the only one you want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It doesn’t matter if you primarily do your gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or even an Android tablet or phone. The Xbox core wireless controller is still possibly the best option for a gaming controller to choose from. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">And right now because of Prime Big Deals Days, you can nab one for 21% off.</a> Through today, the 2025 Xbox gaming controller has dropped from $65 to as low as just $50. That amount to a savings of $15. That’s exactly enough extra cash to buy yourself the insanely additive roguelike deck builder <em>Balatro</em>.</p>
<p>Each new console generation, Sony has been reinventing the wheel. The company behind PlayStation has been adding new bells and whistles to the original DualShock controller design. We’ve seen innovations like a touchpad or haptic triggers. These can be cool gimmicks, but most games don’t utilize to their full extent if at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Xbox decided to do things differently. They locked down the current controller design back in 2013 with the Xbox One launch and said, “Yeah this works.” And you know what? It does.</p>
<h2>Unbeatable Controller Design</h2>
<p>There have been some minor innovations since then like the addition of Bluetooth support, a share button, and the change to the now standard USB-C. Though those have been just to keep up with the times. The basic structure, layout, and feel of the controller are mostly unchanged. This certainly comes down to personal preference, but the D-pad on the Xbox controller puts the first party D-pad of the PS5 and Nintendo Switch to shame.</p>



<p>One big thing that has actually changed in that time is the options for customization. You can now map out button layouts at the system level, not just relying on in-game settings. Put together your personal preferences in the Xbox Accessories app to tweak how your controller works. It may not be something everyone needs or wants, but anything that broadens the accessibility for more players is a win for all of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">The Xbox controller is available in all sorts of vibrant colors and patterns, as well as the more classic and subtle black or white.</a> The discounts across these various variants very much vary. The robot white model right now is the cheapest at $50. The carbon black is slightly more at just $51. Deep pink is down to $54 with electric volt at $53. Some of the patterned ones like the ice breaker or heart breaker are still sitting at their full prices of $80.</p>

<p>Life continues to find a way, with Jurassic World Evolution 3 marking the next stage in the franchise with some major changes, and we’ve got the exact release date and start times for the title.</p>



<p>The third iteration of the franchise, which began back in 2018, Jurassic World Evolution 3 takes a big step forward with the debut of baby dinosaurs and modular building, features that are crucial in sister titles Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster.</p>



<p>If you want to count down the hours until you can build the park of your dreams, or sacrifice guests to a T. Rex, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-jurassic-world-evolution-3-coming-out">When is Jurassic World Evolution 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Baby dinos. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be released on October 21 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>With no delays to the release date, the game is ready for launch to mark the next era of the franchise for Frontier Developments, following on from two previous iterations of the game.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is Frontier’s big release of the year, following on from Planet Coaster 2 in 2024, but the exact time you can dive into the park management sim depends on where you are located in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-jurassic-world-evolution-3-start-time">Do we Know The Jurassic World Evolution 3 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Store listings confirm that Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be available to play from 7 AM PT on October 21, with players elsewhere in the world needing to wait until later in the day.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmed by the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2377-PPSA25153_00-JWEVOLUTION30000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a global release and unlocks simultaneously for all players. This isn’t too surprising, as online features are minimal, so there’s no need for a staggered launch to ease stress on the servers.</p>

                <p>Sony is feeling blue — but in a good way — as the company has just revealed a new limited-edition DualSense controller. The Icon Blue Special Edition gives the peripheral a striking makeover, wrapping it in layered shades of blue, and it'll be available to preorder exclusively from Walmart for $85 when it goes on sale starting October 20.</p><p>The peripheral's colorway is inspired by the signature blue glow of the PS5 consoles when it's powered on, and according to Sony designer Leo Cardoso, the design is meant to capture the "feeling of anticipation and wonder" whenever you boot up the console. Other small touches include Katakana characters on the back and PlayStation shapes on the D-pad.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581938"></a><figcaption>Icon Blue DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581939,1300-4581940,1300-4581941" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>If you're looking for a different type of design, you can grab limited edition DualSense controllers inspired by two of the biggest PS5 exclusives of the year, as well as one of the company's beloved franchises.

The feature, powered by Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service, provides two 30-minute trial sessions per week to Discord users who don’t have Fortnite installed on their PC.</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> trial will be available until October 30th, with sessions updated every Tuesday at 9:59AM ET, according to Epic’s announcement. You can access the demos by <a href="https://fortnitetrial.fortnite.com/en-US/">clicking the sign-up link</a> on Epic’s announcement page, which will then redirect you to Discord. Availability is limited to PC players in the US, UK, Mexico, Canada, and several European countries. However, it’s worth flagging that myself and another UK-based colleague were unable to launch the experience in Discord without using a VPN that connected to the US.</p><p>There are no requirements to install <em>Fortnite</em> to play the demos, but users need to be signed into both their Discord and Epic Games accounts to connect them for the trial. Epic says that it doesn’t share players’ data with Nvidia or Discord, but notes that the companies “may independently” collect it.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-saros-10r-1-600-robot-vacuum-is-now-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-quietly-clearing-out-all-its-stock.1319419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums have evolved far beyond the basic “bump-and-spin” models that once dominated store shelves at budget prices. Roborock has firmly planted itself in the luxury segment of this market, where several of their flagship models now command $1,500 or more. These aren’t machines you can compare to the $200 to $400 entry-level options still available at big-box stores. The difference becomes obvious the moment you watch one work:<strong> genuine autonomy, intelligent navigation, and cleaning performance that replaces human effort</strong> rather than simply supplementing it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Saros 10R</a> embodies everything that separates premium robot vacuums from their cheaper cousins, handling everything from self-emptying to obstacle avoidance with sophistication that justifies its positioning. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">Prime Big Deal Day has brought this model down to $1,199 from its standard $1,599 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes luxury-tier automated cleaning more accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering Excellence That Cleans Deeper</h2>
<p>The Roborock Saros 10R’s 3.14-inch ultra-slim profile represents a fundamental design shift enabled by the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0, which eliminates the raised LiDAR dome that makes traditional robot vacuums too tall to fit under most furniture. This<strong> system uses 3D sensing technology to map your home with precision</strong>, even navigating under narrow-legged furniture and suspended cabinets where dust accumulates undisturbed for months in typical homes.</p>
<p>The VertiBeam lateral obstacle avoidance system illustrates the intelligence gap between this vacuum and low-end robots: It <strong>recognizes and avoids 108 distinct types of obstructions</strong>, including charging cables that would futilely entangle low-end models. It can also vacuum along cords without the need for you to prep your floors, and removes the ironic task that is cleaning before your new robotic vacuum can vacuum.</p>



<p>Cleaning power comes from <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction that pulls embedded dirt from carpet fibers</strong> and extracts debris from tile grout lines with equal effectiveness. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide Main Brush solves the persistent problem of hair wrapping around rollers, a design that handles long human hair and pet fur without creating the tangled mess that forces you to manually cut away accumulated strands.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm</em> riser technology introduces <strong>extendable side brushes and extendable mops</strong> that reach into the corners and edges, beyond the reach of the fixed-position tools that leave messes behind. As the robot senses the presence of a corner or edge, the arms extend automatically to sweep and mop the spaces that would have had to be done manually. This dynamic response closes the cleaning gaps that leave cheaper robots incomplete.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis represents industry-first engineering that Roborock pioneered, and <strong>allows the robot to climb obstacles up to 4cm high</strong> including door thresholds and navigate around U-shaped furniture legs that trap conventional robots. When carpets are detected, the dual spinning mops and their bracket lift automatically to prevent soaking your rugs, then lower again on hard floors for mopping.</p>
<p>The dock 4.0 handles the unglamorous but essential maintenance tasks automatically: It washes mop pads with 176°F hot water that dissolves grease and sanitizes the fabric, then dries them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew. The <strong>60-day automatic dust collection</strong> means you empty the dock’s collection bin roughly six times per year instead of after every cleaning session.</p>
<p>At the price of $1,199 for Prime Day on Amazon, you’re spending money on everyday convenience that is truly luxurious, although <strong>this Prime-member exclusive offer ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> is nearly over, but that isn’t stopping fans from arguing about whether multiplayer is better with Open or Closed Weapon classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and the four-company team at Battlefield Studios will let loose their new entry in the large-scale military shooter series this Friday, October 10, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-global-release-times-confirmed">find out when, exactly, here</a>). Along with a new campaign, guns, gadgets, and maps, the developers behind Battlefield 6 have told fans to look forward to a return to form following the disappointment that was Battlefield 2042.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta and Battlefield Labs players have largely come away excited for what Battlefield 6 promises, but the debate surrounding Open and Closed Weapons is the main thing on fans’ minds just two days out from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation picked up when players went hands-on during the August Battlefield 6 beta tests. While many past Battlefield games feature Closed Weapons – a design decision that locks classes to a specific set of guns – many were surprised to see the new Battlefield game add and prioritize an option for Open Weapons, which largely removes gun restrictions between classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Open style is similar to the system used in Battlefield 2042, but it’s not the bad taste in players’ mouths that has them bickering. Closed Weapons defenders argue these restrictions encourage players to not only think on their feet but also rely on teamwork, a key element for many longtime fans of the series. The system could also pour cold water on meta gameplay strategies that could result in an unbalanced number of players relying on one particularly powerful gun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those on the other side of the fence feel Open Weapons offer players of all skill levels more freedom to craft a loadout that fits their playstyles while rewarding those who choose specific loadouts. Though perhaps not quite as vocal, there are plenty of players who feel Open loadouts are the way to go – and BF Studios agrees.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield Studios Says Players Prefer Open Weapons</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Debate continued up to earlier this week, when BF Studios offered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-day-one-patch-includes-changes-to-movement-weapon-recoil-rush-and-more"><u>a pre-release breakdown for its Battlefield 6 launch day plans</u></a>, previewing the contents of its day one patch for those looking forward to in-game changes following post-beta feedback. It came hand-in-hand with confirmation that data pointed to “a vast majority of players” preferring the Open system more than the Closed system after trying both options between different playlists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6,” the message from BF Studios says. “At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter how loud fans of the Closed method are, BF Studios is adamant that players mostly gravitate toward an Open system, even if Battlefield 6 will continue to support both options. Meanwhile, many have used this latest update only as fuel to continue their mission to see this week’s new Battlefield game shift its focus to the Closed system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their argument revolves around the notion that open beta players only favored Open Weapons because relevant playlist options are the first to appear on the Battlefield 6 multiplayer menu screen. So, the idea is, if your average player, who is unfamiliar with the discourse, boots up the game, they’ll need to dig for a Closed option, resulting in skewed data.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a criticism many are leaning on that EA and BF Studios have already stepped in to stomp out. Lead Battlefield producer at DICE David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975264910285459695" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> to explain how the team came to their conclusion. He addresses the argument that Closed playlist options were hidden from players, reminding displeased fans that playlist and mode tiles often moved around, and their data accounted for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes they moved around alot, as you may have noticed,” Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975266470260273583" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said in response</u></a> to a fan asking for clarification. “We did this to all tiles, [Conquest] vs [Breakthrough] etc. See how much tile placement impact pick rates and how single mode vs playlist with multiple modes differed, etc.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland’s explanation still hasn’t quite quelled the uproar, as one third of the Battlefield 6 community demands more answers while another third is voicing their support for Open playlists more than ever. That final third mostly just wants the fighting to come to an end.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Brutal truth:</p><p>Casuals won’t care about Closed Weapons.

<p>Sales launch in just under a week, with LRG offering up both a standard edition and a collector's edition, known officially as the 'Full Force Edition'.</p>
<p>The big boy comes with several added extras, including:</p>
<ul>

<p>Of course, all of these goodies do ramp up the price slightly, so you're looking at $79.99 for the Full Force Edition. The standard, meanwhile, is a bit more forgiving at $39.99. Limited Run Games has also clarified that this won't be a numbered release, so if you're looking for a full LRG set, missing out on this one won't be the end of the world.</p>
<p>Now let's check out a brief summary of the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"R-Type Delta HD Boosted features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this PlayStation masterpiece until they’re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven’t experienced R-Type Delta until you've played it in high definition. This version of the game also comes equipped with a new Practice Mode for those of you who want to polish your skills until they are as sharp as the resolution itself!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available digitally on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is an action-packed adventure through time and space, with plenty to offer, but as it lands in a period stacked of new releases, questions about the game length are understandable.</p>



<p>With hundreds of Digimon to collect, a gripping story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of optional content to explore, prepare to sink many hours into Time Stranger.</p>



<p>For a full breakdown of exactly how many hours you can expect to put into Digimon Story: Time Stranger, for both a generic run and a completionist run, you’ll find all the details in our game length guide here.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Hours to Beat Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It will take around 40 hours to complete the main story of Digimon Story: Time Stranger, though that time is extended by side quests and difficulty level.</strong></p>



<p>Time Stranger features a host of side-quests to tick off, which add hours to the duration of the game, and it will take even longer if you want to tackle the longer side quests, like defeating all of the opponents in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-great-omni-carnival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Colosseum</a>.</p>



<p>The length of the game also depends on the difficulty setting you’re playing on, and whether you can defeat bosses in a single attempt or need to retry several times. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-digimon-story-time-stranger-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Digimon Story: Time Stranger Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A full completionist run in Digimon Story: Time Stranger will take an additional 100 hours on top of the main story.</strong></p>



<p>This is due to the vast number of tasks that need to be ticked off to boast 100% completion, including obtaining all Digimon, collecting all Digimon Cards, and defeating opponents in the Paradise Colosseum.</p>



<p>There are a whopping 471 Digimon in the game, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-season-pass-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more to be added in DLC</a>, and 451 cards to collect. Along the way, there’s also a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-achievements-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of achievements and trophies</a> to earn.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, side quests can take a significant amount of time on their own, especially completing the Colosseum. With some battles only unlocking once specific requirements are met, this pumps up the required amount of time to play by a large amount.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FIFA 23, the last FIFA game by EA, will shut down its servers on October 30, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the agreement with Electronic Arts and FIFA came to an end a couple of years ago, with the former <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> EA Sports FC to replace the franchise. The EA FC series began after FIFA 23, making that the last FIFA game that EA created. </p>



<h2 id="h-fifa-23-servers-are-shutting-down-on-october-30">FIFA 23 Servers Are Shutting Down on October 30 </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-fifa-era-is-officially-coming-to-an-end-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, confirmation that FIFA 23 will shut down its servers was announced on the EA Service Updates <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/legal/service-updates/a-h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a>. If you scroll down to ‘F’, the new update states that online services will no longer be available for Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. Players will still be able to play the game offline; however, no online updates, online co-op, Ultimate Team, Pro Clubs, or any other online features will be available to the player. </p>



<p>The era for new EA FIFA games had already ended when the deal between the two parties ended. However, players now have a few days left to play the last EA FIFA game online, until the next one becomes available. Regarding the next one, 2K Games could potentially be developing the next mainline FIFA video game. EA has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that even if the rumors are true, they welcome the competition and “know how tough it is to make a football game.”</p>



<p>In other news, the first new FIFA game after the breakup with EA has officially been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-new-fifa-game-post-ea-breakup-announced-and-its-not-what-players-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>, and it’s not the game fans likely expected. Additionally, read about Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/">addressing the rumors</a> surrounding a possible partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports. What are your thoughts on FIFA 23 shutting down its servers this month? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Once you’ve updated the game and reached “City Bazaar Rank,” the Nature Sprites will visit during an event cut scene introducing “Happy Bingo.” Each spot on the card features an everyday activity like fishing or petting animals. Players complete these activities to fill spots on their card until they’ve completed a Happy Bingo! Players then turn in completed cards at the Nature Sprites’ stall, Happy Shoppe, on bazaar days to earn a variety of useful items.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's not just bingo, either. Marvelous has thrown a handful of other fixes and tweaks into this update, all of which were shared in an update post on Steam. We've collected these patch notes together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar - Ver. 1.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bingo features added<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue resulting in a rare game crash<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where dismounting from horse would reset bag color to default outfit settings<br></li>
<li>Fixed issue where pet food bowl would stop functioning properly after rehoming a pet<br></li>
<li>Adjusted select BGM and sound effect volume<br></li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
<li>Addressed Unity security vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>While we had a few small issues with the fishing and sheer number of gameplay systems, we called Grand Bazaar "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 8/10 review</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-about-humiliation-but-the-joy-of-disobedient-flesh">Falling over is the thing</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. Sure, the goal in Bennett Foddy and co's walking sim is technically getting from A to B despite your doughy corpus' best efforts to get in the way, but it's the constant stumbling and hilarious unintended pratfalls which make these sorts of games really sing. You get plenty of that playing alone, but for those who want to take things to the next level, Baby Steps has a multiplayer mod that'll let you slap against your mates and gently bump their mushy forms off course.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/babysteps/mods/1?tab=description">Baby Steps multiplayer mod</a> by Caleb Orchard has only just hit Nexus Mods, it's already been through several early iterations on <a href="https://github.com/caleborchard/Baby-Steps-Multiplayer-Mod-Client">GitHub</a> and even <a href="https://x.com/bfod/status/1971393914574962710">gotten the approval of Foddy himself</a>.</p>
<p>With it installed, rather than taking on the life of a failson with misbehaving limbs alone, you and a gang of others can run around in a range of different coloured onesies. Your gang of badly coordinated Teletubbies can collide with each other if you enable that setting and as you can see in the video below, the result is the possibility to send someone skidding down a cliff or flying off a ledge with a single well-timed nudge.</p>

<p>Since recording that video, Orchard looks to have worked out how to ensure cutscenes trigger independently for each player's instance of the game, as well as ensuring hats and held items don't only show up for the host.The current version, <a href="https://github.com/caleborchard/Baby-Steps-Multiplayer-Mod-Client/releases/tag/1.1.2">1.1.2</a>, has also been through a couple of rounds of bugfixing since its initial 1.0 release last month, meaning it should hopefully be stable and relatively free from the sort of frustrating jank which could impede the intended fun jank.</p><p>As of writing, the modder is working on adding the likes of "dynamic suit muddying and wetness", water/dust particles, and "player sound effects" - which I assume'll be suitably goofy - to an equation which already seems a brilliant recipe for mischief and the occasional ruined friendship.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving that kind of action a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://melonwiki.xyz/#/">MelonLoader</a> framework and follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQRWCoEZUk">handy installation tutorial</a> Orchard's put together. For more thoughts on Baby Steps, I direct you to Nic, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-twitch-slop-you-have-simply-let-your-sense-of-wonder-atrophy">reckons Irish comic Dara Ó Briain would dig it</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-offloads-its-old-t7-external-ssds-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-at-amazon-2000633112</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-offloads-its-old-t7-external-ssds-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-at-amazon.1319383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>External storage needs have exploded as file sizes balloon with 4K video and high-resolution photos that exceed what internal drives can handle. Samsung recently launched their T9 portable SSDs with improved durability features but the performance gap compared to the T7 is minimal for most users while the price difference is substantial.</p>
<p>That makes the T7 SSD the smarter choice for anyone prioritizing value without sacrificing speed or capacity. Prime Big Deal Day<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/"> has pushed the 2TB Samsung T7 down to $129 from its usual $187 price, which marks an all-time low</a> that makes premium portable storage genuinely affordable. This <strong>Prime-exclusive offer</strong> expires tonight, giving members just hours to grab what remains the most popular external SSD on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True Speed and Capacity that Matter</h2>
<p>The Samsung T7 PCIe NVMe technology<strong> can read at up to 1,050 MB/s, and write at up to 1,000 MB/s</strong>, translating to transferring a 50GB video project in just under a minute. Compare that with slower external hard drives plodding along at 120 MB/s and you know why creatives have left spinning platters behind. It makes <strong>the T7 roughly twice as fast as Samsung’s own previous T5</strong>, which is a significant leap that affects your workflow every time you transfer large files.</p>



<p>The 2TB size is just the sweet spot for the average user and offers enough storage room for full-scale libraries of videos, massive collections of photographs or complete sets of computer games without requiring frequent housekeeping. With 2TB, you never have the hassle of rotating files around or determining which ones need deleting as new material arrives. Samsung sells the T7 in capacities as high as 4TB, but the 2TB is the best-value-per-gigabyte at current price points.</p>
<p><strong>Built-in direct video recording abilities</strong> turn the T7 from just storage into a production device: Plug it into compatible cameras or smartphones and capture Ultra High Definition 4K video at 60 frames per second directly to the drive. You can use the iPhone 17 Pro’s ProRes video mode to shoot directly onto the T7 and <strong>skip the phone’s small internal storage</strong> and allowing you to capture multiple hours of professional quality video without clogging up your phone.</p>



<p>The T7’s solid aluminum unibody construction provides <strong>shock resistance with drop protection tested up to 6 feet</strong>. This metal chassis serves double duty by acting as a heatsink that dissipates the heat generated during sustained high-speed transfers, preventing thermal throttling that could slow performance. The compact design measures roughly the size of a credit card and weighs just 0,13lbs/58 grams.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility eliminates the typical hassles of formatting drives for other systems: The <strong>T7 is compatible with Windows PCs, Macs, Android smartphones, and gaming consoles</strong> via the USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface without a hitch. Samsung ships the drive with both the USB-C to C and the USB-C to A cable, providing the capability of plugging into both new and old devices without scrambling for adapters. The drive comes<strong> shipped in the exFAT format</strong>, which is read-compatible on virtually all contemporary operating systems without reformating.</p>
<p>At a price of $129 in the 2TB version, you pay approximately 6 cents per gigbyte on storage that reads the data at almost ten times the speed that the mechanical drives read the data. Keep in mind, this Prime Big Deal Day price ends tonight.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is getting a free trial for an entire week, starting 9th October. This free trial for last year's Call of Duty will provide access to the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies game modes - so interested players can play everything Blops currently has to offer.</p>
<p>This on its own would be some nice news for those looking for something to do during this month but with little money in their pocket right now, but an extra interesting layer to this free trial is that it's taking place during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> release.</p>
<p>If this timing is intentional, it would mark the first case of marketing retaliation from Activision in the ongoing public scuffle between the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and Battlefield 6. This scuffle started during the Battlefield 6 Multiplayer reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">where the developers at Battlefield Studios weren't shy about their intentions to stick to sensible military cosmetics, rather than the gaudy out-of-universe skins available in CoD</a>.</p>

<p>Following this discussion about wacky cosmetics' prevalence in Call of Duty entering the zeitgeist, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-u-turn-on-absurd-cosmetics-is-proof-that-battlefield-6-competition-is-a-really-good-thing">Activision soon announced its intention to pull back a bit from its cosmetic approach in Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Even so, EA continued to push this messaging in advertisements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">bringing in celebrities to star in a recent Battlefield 6 live-action trailer in reference to Call of Duty's history of selling real-world figures as in-game skins</a>. The trailer soon blows these celebrities up, with a squad of typical looking soldiers taking their place.</p><p>So the clash over public opinion has been rather one-sided so far, but dropping Black Ops 6 for free during the Battlefield 6 release date is a pretty solid way to strike back, especially given the fact that Black Ops 6 is at the tail end of its lifespan with Black Ops 7 set to launch next month.</p>
<p>For those who do decide to hop into Black Ops 6 during this free week, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-06#Events">they'll be met with a collection of Halloween-themed events and cosmetics</a> to get them into the festive mood. These will transfer over to Warzone but not to Black Ops 7 as part of that aforementioned decision to keep things visually coherent in the new game, so keep that in mind.</p>
