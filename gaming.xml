<p>Shadow Drop of the Tomb Raider</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Oooof, we love a good shadow drop – <em>love it</em>.</p>
<p>This is one of the coolest we've seen in quite some time, as Aspyr has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is now available – out of <em>nowhere</em> – on the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2013 by Crystal Dynamics as a full reboot of the legendary action-adventure series starring Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition gained critical acclaim for its more grounded approach to exploration, strong visuals, and brutal combat.</p>
<p>We're a little sceptical about the visuals on display here, though. Although this is the Definitive Edition, which was effectively a remastered version of Tomb Raider for the PS4, some key enhancements don't appear to be present here.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious one as far as we can see is the increased fidelity seen on Lara's hair. This was a big talking point back in the day, and if this was possible on PS4, why isn't it present here on the Switch 2? Our guess is the game has probably been optimised primarily for the original Switch and thus lost a few of those enhanced features.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. We're very keen to get stuck into this, and we're hopeful this means <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will also follow suit at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Fans can already experience a bunch of classic Lara Croft adventures with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> on the Switch, with Aspyr adding newly enhanced visuals alongside the original PS1 aesthetics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that it will not release F1 26 in the coming year; instead, EA Sports F1 25 will get a major expansion meant to cover the 2026 Formula 1 season, with the series returning to its regular mainline release in 2027 with EA Sports F1 27.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">announced in a blog post on the EA website</a>, in which EA claims the decision was made "<em>as part of a strategic reset for the F1 franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following on from F1 25’s commercial and critical success - with praise from players, media, content creators, and F1 drivers alike - the team is building on the experience through a paid expansion," </em>the post reads.<em> "The premium content update will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The decision to offer a premium content update for F1® 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1® Franchise. In 2027, a new game will be released that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.</em>"</p>

<p>Codemasters senior creative director, Lee Mather, added, <em></em><em>"We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world.</em>"</p>



<p>With Codemasters taking a year off in many ways to get ready for the next full release in 2027, it'll be interesting to see what the jump between F1 25 and F1 27 looks like. Also, regarding next year's big paid expansion for F1 25, meant to cover the 2026 F1 season, the price that expansion releases at will likely make or break the success of this experiment.</p>

Its upcoming Echo Aviation Controller is about the size of a console gamepad but squeezes standard features like joysticks and buttons to one side to make room for flight-specific controls like throttle levers and a dedicated trim wheel.</p><p>The Echo Aviation Controller is expected to be available in mid-December 2025 for $149.99 through the <a href="https://flyhoneycomb.com/">company’s online store</a>. It’s fully compatible with various PC-based flight simulators, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/785181/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a>, and it connects to a computer with a USB-C cable or wirelessly using a dongle, <a href="https://fselite.net/content/honeycomb-aeronautical-has-completely-revamped-the-echo-aviation-controller-for-the-better/">according to Calum Martin at <em>FSElite</em></a>, who went hands on with the gamepad at a recent event.</p><p>On the left side of the main controller you’ll find a thumbstick, four action buttons, and a second conical joystick used to control a simulator’s camera. Meanwhile, the right side is where all the flight specific controls are located: four throttle levers accompanied by a trim wheel that can be adjusted to maintain a plane’s altitude without additional inputs.</p><p>On the bottom of the Echo Aviation Controller are dedicated controls for adjusting the aircraft’s flaps, raising or lowering the landing gear, and activating the parking brake so you don’t have to reach for your keyboard as frequently. There are also two sets of shoulder buttons on the top edge, and on the back you’ll find a pair of sliding paddles that move in opposition and function as rudders, controlling the side-to-side movement of your aircraft’s nose and aiding in steering while navigating an airport and runways.</p><p>In addition to a hard shell carrying case, the Echo Aviation Controller will come with a collection of interchangeable caps for the throttle levers and other controls so you can customize and easily differentiate each of them by their shape or color if you’ve remapped their functionality.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/823018/honeycomb-aeronautical-echo-aviation-controller-gamepad-pc-flight-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's a bit more excitement than usual, even among veteran car-watchers like me, for next year's F1 season. You see, the series is bringing in some <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/fia-unveils-formula-1-regulations-for-2026-and-beyond-featuring-more-agile.75qJiYOHXgeJqsVQtDr2UB">new rules</a> governing what its cars will look like and how they'll perform, meaning there's more potential on paper for serious changes to the established pecking order. Given that, I'm a bit unsure how to feel about EA and Codemasters having announced they're not making an F1 26, instead skipping ahead to 2027 with a DLC to fill the gap.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Codemasters senior creative director Lee Mather <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">wrote</a> that this this call's been made as part of "a strategic reset" of the studio's F1 games, and stresses they and EA are "fully committed" to making F1 games going forwards. That last bit's probably in light of rally sim fans seeing this announcement and initially thinking '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">oh no, not again</a>', especially since Codies have released a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/formula-1">yearly F1 game</a> since 2010.</p>
<p>Instead of a new game for the first year of these new 2026 regulations, F1 25'll instead be getting a 2026 season paid DLC, which Mather wrote "will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers." Then, in 2027, there'll be a new F1 game that'll "mark the start of a new and more expansive F1 experience".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨</p><p>EA SPORTS will release a paid expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F125?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F125</a> in 2026, with the current game serving as the foundation for the 2026 season.</p><p>Additionally, 2027 will see the release of a new, reimagined EA SPORTS F1 title, that looks, feels, and plays differently.</p><p>📕 Read… <a href="https://t.co/Rk8hOmT1Yw">pic.twitter.com/Rk8hOmT1Yw</a></p></div>— EA SPORTS F1 (@EASPORTSF1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>On one hand, I've been on the side of yearly iterations of sports games often being pointless for years. Unless there are big changes planned, skipping a year and just doing a roster update to the last entry often feels like the better option for all parties except maybe the accountants. F1's a bit of different bag than ball sports, but taking a year to just see what the new rule changes do to the real world racing could well result in being able to simulate them better without as much of a scramble to react to anything unanticipated right out of the gate could be a similarly good call.</p><p>On the other, it'd maybe have made more sense on paper for F1 25, the last year of the current regulations which have been in place since 2022 and a season which has seen many teams skimp on current car development to concentrate on the all-new challenge of 2026, to be the year without a new game. Take a year to really have the developers delve into the new rules, and see if they can nail a fresh sim package and series revamp in time with them. Naturally, that assumes this pause was planned well in advance and hasn't seen me take into account any factors beyond what sounds good from the outside.</p>
<p>We'll see how it works out. As of right now, next year will be the first year in a long time I'll not spend part of digging into a fresh Codemasters racer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-15-inch-gaming-monitor-cheaper-than-budget-controller-now-lets-you-play-switch-on-big-screen-2000645164</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/portable-15-inch-gaming-monitor-cheaper-than-budget-controller-now-lets-you-play-switch-on-big-screen.1357060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo Switch users squint at the 7-inch handheld screen for hours on end and lose important visual details and straining their eyes in marathon gaming sessions. <strong>Portable monitors solve that by turning handheld consoles into proper gaming rigs</strong> wherever you go and acting as secondary displays for laptop productivity.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/"> 15.6-inch monitor gets 1080p resolution in an ultra-thin frame, now sitting at $49 instead of the usual $59 price tag</a>. That pricing undercuts budget gaming controllers but offers functionality that fundamentally shifts how you work and play on the go. The <strong>monitor itself weighs just 1.43 pounds</strong> with a built-in kickstand and makes it truly portable rather than another heavy accessory collecting dust at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display with 178-Degree Viewing Angles</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display supports 1920 x 1080 with IPS panel technology</strong> that keeps color and brightness accurate from extreme angles up to 178 degrees. You can position the monitor off to the side when giving presentations or working collaboratively, and colors won’t shift or contrast degrade for viewers at an angle. The designation of an IPS A-grade panel indicates even better panel selection with fewer dead pixels and more consistent backlighting than that found on less-costly panels.<strong> HDR support</strong> will extend the dynamic range in content that supports the feature, brightening highlights and deepening shadows to a more life-like image reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Low blue light mode</strong> reduces eye strain during extended viewing by filtering out harmful blue wavelengths that contribute to fatigue and sleep disruption. That matters during marathon gaming sessions or situations at work when you’re staring at screens all day for eight-plus hours. The screen also comes with a matte anti-glare coating diffusing any reflections from overhead lights or windows and keeps the screen visible under bright conditions where glossy displays become mirrors. <strong>Response time sits around 5ms</strong> and keeps everything smooth for casual gaming and video playback.</p>



<p><strong>Dual USB-C ports</strong> provide both power and video signal over a single cable when connected to supported devices. Newer laptops using Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode transmit video over USB-C and removes the need for a separate power adapter or video cables. The second USB-C port acts as a dedicated power input for those devices that cannot supply enough power over their USB-C ports. Additionally,<strong> a Mini HDMI port</strong> is available for older laptops, desktops, and game consoles that depend on traditional video outputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch connects through USB-C</strong> when the unit is docked or via Mini HDMI with an adapter, and it upgrades instantly from a 7-inch handheld screen to a proper 15.6-inch display. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles all connect via HDMI, making the portable monitor a dedicated gaming display for bedrooms or travel.</p>



<p>It has dual built-in speakers along the bottom edge and offers stereo sound that is much clearer and louder than laptop speakers. The audio quality remains adequate for video calling, casual gaming and streaming content, though serious gaming or music listening could benefit with headphones or external speakers. The volume controls sit on the side panel alongside power and menu buttons for adjusting brightness and contrast and selecting between inputs.</p>
<p>The monitor <strong>does not rely on external power adapters in the case of devices</strong> that supply sufficient USB-C power when connected. This ensures cable simplicity during travels. In the event of low-power devices, connecting the second USB-C to a power source becomes necessary-an addition of one more cable to your setup. Power consumption remains less than 10 watts during normal use, hence drawing little power from the connected laptops or power banks.</p>
<p>You pay less than most budget game controllers for a full 1080p display that expands your gaming and productivity capabilities at $49. Most competing 15.6-inch portable monitorsbetween $120 to $200 with similar specs which makes this sale drop the price to buy levels.</p>

              <p>The cost of gaming is too damn high. Seriously, these machines just keep going up in price and every year it feels like we’re getting closer to $90-$100 games. Keeping an eye on sales is essential these days, and thankfully, if you’re in the market for a PS5, you can save a full Benjamin on the cost of a new one thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-ps5-discount-sale-pro-2000644002">Sony’s Black Friday 2025 deal</a>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">One Year Later, I’ve Forgotten I Even Own A PS5 Pro</a></p> <p>Black Friday, the most sacrosanct of consumerist holidays, will see Sony offer a suite of PS5 bundles, as well as a flat $100 discount on PS5 Digital Edition, the disc-based version, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">the PS5 Pro</a>. Sony has outlined the specifics of the deals over on its official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/18/playstations-black-friday-deals-2025/">PlayStation blog</a>. Console savings include:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">The PS5 Digital Edition 825GB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $399.99 USD and the PS5 Console 1TB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $449.99. The bundle offerings feature PlayStation-exclusive in-game content** and 1,000 V-Bucks.</li> <li aria-level="1">In select regions, players can also save $100USD on PS5 consoles and $100 USD on PS5 Digital Edition consoles.*</li> <li aria-level="1">Gamers looking for the most visually impressive PS5 gaming experience can also save $100 USD on PS5 Pro consoles.*</li> </ul> <p>But that’s not all. Sony is also taking $100 off of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-vr2-ps5-sony-oculus-meta-quest-valve-index-alyx-1850121563">PS VR2</a> (which you can also use on a PC with the right adapter, I might add). You can also pick up a new DualSense controller for $20 off, or for $30 off of the more premium (and very good) DualSense Edge gamepad.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">$100 USD off PlayStation VR2</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off PlayStation Portal remote player</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off Pulse Elite wireless headset</li> <li aria-level="1">$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li> <li aria-level="1">$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off Access controller</li> <li aria-level="1">Various discounts on PS5 games such as <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em></li> </ul> <p>Speaking for myself, my current controller is starting to show signs of drift, so I’m likely eyeing a new controller anyway. That or I’m gonna get creative with a soldering iron (which might end up being a wildly more expensive indulgence).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-the-game-awards-aren%E2%80%99t-rigged.1357054/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! The time is [Redacted] and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of interesting news, shit you might care about, and [Redacted]. We hope you enjoy your visit and get to learn more about Valve’s newly revealed Steam Machines, <em>Roblox</em> face-scanning tech, [Redacted], and Shroud’s problems with the Game Awards. And remember, please don’t [Redacted] or you might [Redacted]. Have a great day!</p>  <p>Popular video game streamer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661">content creator Shroud</a> is a big fan of this year’s excellent extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders.</em> And he’s not, apparently, a fan of the Game Awards snubbing the game for its Game of the Year award.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-world-is-just-not-ready-for-ai-in-video-games-shroud-accuses-the-game-awards-of-being-rigged-following-arc-raiders-goty-snub">As reported by <em>IGN</em>,</a> in a recent Twitch stream, Shroud watched the Game Awards nominees being announced and, upon seeing that<em> Arc Raiders</em> wasn’t in the running for the big GOTY award, expressed disappointment, saying, “The world is just not ready for AI in video games, not yet. They’re just not ready. But, hey, at least they nominated it for something. I genuinely thought they wouldn’t nominate it for anything because they were scared to get backlash. But at least they nominated it for something, so that’s good.” He then stated: “Once again, another year, another rigged year. That’s crazy.” Even before the nominees were revealed, <a href="https://x.com/shroud/status/1990460220020240848">he was claiming the show might be rigged.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>It’s a bit odd to suggest the world isn’t ready for <em>Arc Raiders</em>, considering it’s one of the most-played games on Steam right now and has received heaps of critical praise. And there is zero evidence that the Game Awards this year or any previous year are rigged. The awards are voted on by a panel of members of the games media and influencers. <em>IGN </em>reports that later in the stream, &nbsp;Shroud expressed disappointment at the possibility of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> winning, asking “who the fuck is playing” the Switch 2 platformer.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> rolls out age verification via face scanning</strong></h2> <p>Prepare to have your face scanned before playing <em>Roblox</em>. The extremely popular online free-to-play game has started <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-begins-rolling-out-age-checks-using-facial-age-estimation-technology">rolling out a voluntary face-scanning system</a> that will be used to check a player’s age and limit the ability for kids and adults to communicate. For now, you won’t need to verify your age by scanning your face with the <em>Roblox</em> app to play experiences online, but certain chat features will be locked behind the new process. And next year, age verification via a face scan will be required globally for all players to access the game at all. The company promises that it will delete all images and videos “immediately after processing.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> balloons will be included in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645171"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645171">©Macy’s / Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>Netflix’s hit animated movie <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>continues to take over the world. Two characters from the cartoon, Derpy Tiger and Sussie, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-20-anniversary-voldemort-better-book/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=691c910e43e91a00019ec3e1&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">will be featured in the annual parade’s 99th installment next week as large, colorful balloons</a>. I’ve still not seen the movie yet, so I don’t have much to add beyond the fact that the balloons look cool and oh god it’s almost Thanksgiving and I have done zero Christmas shopping or planning.</p>

 <h2><strong>Close to a decade after launch, Epic finally adds gifting to its store</strong></h2> <p>Seven years after launch, the Epic Game Store has finally added the ability to gift games to other players on the platform, a feature Valve’s Steam store has supported for years now. <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs">According to a blog post</a> about the new feature, players can now buy and send games directly to people on their Epic friends lists. Gifted games can only be sent to friends and they must not own the game already. If they decline it, you get a full refund.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam Machines are more powerful than 70 percent of PCs that use Steam</strong></h2> <p>Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine, a console-like PC device for your TV, is supposedly more powerful than the majority of computers using Steam in 2025. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/valve-says-the-steam-machine-is-better-than-what-70-percent-of-pc-gamers-have-at-home-a-convenient-reminder-that-not-all-gaming-pcs-are-monster-rigs/">That’s according to Valve, as spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> In a recent video from Tested, the channel talked to Valve engineers who explained that for most Steam users, the upcoming Steam Machine will be an upgrade.</p>

 <p>“Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey,” said Valve. “Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people’s home devices are at in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70 percent of what people have at home.”</p> <p>A good reminder that most people playing PC games aren’t running powerful rigs with cutting-edge tech, but are instead rocking budget builds with older, less powerful parts. So if the Steam Machine is priced smartly, it could be a big hit for those gamers looking to upgrade.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">Please stop cancelling Yoko Taro’s games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">And here are your Game Awards 2025 nominees</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941">Everybody is mad about <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> on Steam</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

                <p>The future for single-player games has been a question mark since the rise of multiplayer and live-service titles across the video game industry. But according to a newly released survey from Ampere Analysis, single-player games remain the preference for 56% of gamers.</p><p>Ampere has shared the results of its survey, which had responses from 34,000 players across 22 different markets around the world. The new findings note that interest in single-player games has increased 4% over the last four years, and that there's only a small percentage of women (58%) who favor those titles over men (56%) who share their preferences.</p><p>One of the key findings from this survey suggests that fan interest in single-player games increases with age. Only 49% of younger players between 16-24 preferred single-player, while 64% of gamers age 55-64 favored it. Among gamers 25-34, single-player games were preferred by 56%.</p><p>The report notes that the US has the highest share of gamers who prefer single-player titles with 65%. However, Chinese gamers reportedly have the least interest in single-player games, with only 47% of players saying that they prefer those titles.</p><p>"This data reaffirms that single-player games are absolutely still viable--and sought-after--in the live-service-dominated landscape," said Ampere's senior research manager Louise Wooldridge. "The market favors multiplayer games for their ongoing engagement and monetization, but cracking a finely balanced formula for single-player games can leverage this broad audience appeal. Although most gamers prefer this content to multiplayer experiences, the friendship circle still plays a significant role in game discovery and uptake."</p><p>In recent years, Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">canceled a Last of Us multiplayer title</a> to focus on single-player games like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/" data-ref-id="1100-6530174">forcefully pushed back</a> on the notion that single-player titles are dead.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> proudly displays its influences, and the resemblance to games like Persona is clear across multiple aspects. One of them is the school side of things--it's in the name, after all. While most of your time in Demonschool will be spent, well, fighting demons and figuring out how to stop the apocalypse, you still have to hit the books.</p><p>At the very end of each in-game week, you'll be tasked with answering a quiz back at the classroom. In a similar fashion to activities like karaoke, you'll have to pick an answer within a timer. These, of course, are graded at the end--answer everything correctly and you'll be rewarded with relationship points on occasion, as well as moons, the currency used to obtain abilities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160665/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> is a tactical RPG that follows a demon hunter named Faye and her collected companions as members of the Black Magic Club at a poorly-ranked university on a peculiar island by the same name.</p>
<p>The school element of Demonschool should be taken with a big grain of salt, as Faye and her group of weirdos find out for themselves after arriving on the island. They’re given an assignment each week that has little to do with education and everything to do with the mysteries of the university and the impending apocalypse. Characters can 'study' techniques to unlock equipable abilities for the squad, and there is a weekly quiz on the weekends. Outside of furthering the main plot, time is spent building relationships, pursuing side quests, and playing minigames at various locations around town.</p>
<p>Combat is suitably at the heart of gameplay and employs what developer Necrosoft Games describes as "new-style tactics", which draws inspiration from the first two <strong>Persona</strong> games. Each battle begins with choosing your party, where you select which character goes in each starting slot. There are four slots available, and Faye always needs to be in the first. If the fight is connected to a personal quest, sometimes other characters are also locked into a slot.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160671/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>During the planning phase, you can expend action points to navigate each character around the grid-based map. Moving into an enemy constitutes an attack, and different characters apply their own abilities, sometimes pushing enemies into those behind them or pulling and stunning enemies as they pass through.</p>
<p>There are eight action points available for use each round. The first time a character completes an action, they use only one point, and for each subsequent action they use an additional point. For example, it costs two action points for Faye's second movement and three points for her third movement. The balance of point cost, character abilities, and positioning relative to enemies on the map makes for an engaging puzzle each time combat rolls around.</p>
<p>Throughout the planning phase, there’s plenty of room for trial and error. Moves can be rewound and characters can act in any order. Once the movements for the round are locked in, the action phase unfolds, showing all of the piecemeal movements and attacks in full concert with one another. It makes for a satisfying visual, with characters zipping through lines of enemies, activating combos, and sending fountains of blood into the air for each downed combatant. Any remaining enemies then make their moves and attacks before the start of the next round.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160664/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Successfully completed fights are graded as an A, B, or C and confer a corresponding amount of opals (the in-game currency), trophies, and class credits. In order to get a top mark, you need to kill a certain number of demons within the specified number of rounds and get at least one character to the back end of the map to seal the portal. If a team member dies or if you don’t meet the round goal, the grade for the combat goes down. The range of successful outcomes is nice, since a perfectionist player can aim for As, but imperfectly executed bouts don’t stop you from proceeding forward in the game.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of combat in Demonschool does mean that fighting becomes a little tedious at times. Especially in the early game when you only have access to a few characters and abilities, getting through fight after fight against the same demons feels like a slog. Thankfully, the tactical complexity begins to build momentum after the first couple of in-game weeks when new enemy types grace the battlefield and new teammates join the club.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Faye and Namako are the only two playable characters, followed shortly after by the first two additions to the Black Magic Club, Destin and Knute. A total of 15 characters can be recruited and utilised in combat by the end.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160668/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also build Faye’s relationship with the other club members by choosing dialogue options they approve of, singing karaoke with them, cooking them meals, and pursuing their side quests. Relationships are a secondary focus of the game, and Faye herself is irreverent and action-fixated. Still, the cast is varied and interesting enough to entertain.</p>
<p>Demonschool’s plot doesn’t take itself too seriously despite its penchant for horrifying scenarios. Character dialogue leans heavily on jokes and '90s tech references, lending an air of levity to all the gore and death. The art style also seems referential to the era of its setting, but still manages to feel suitable for contemporary gaming. The majority of gameplay is from an isometric view, but the camera does occasionally pan to different angles for important scenes, showing off a mix of 2D and 3D art.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is chock-full of synthy beats that set the mood well. Sound effects punctuate everything from UI navigation to character interactions. There's even a snazzy jingle for when time passes and a new day begins.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160663/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From a technical perspective, I didn’t experience any lag or issues while playing on Switch. There was a short loading time before the start of each battle, which was generally unobtrusive.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Demonschool is a lot of fun and provides a challenging, yet accessible strategic landscape. The mild horror elements pair well with the relaxed and somewhat goofy tone of the story, and the art style is well-suited to the late '90s setting.</p>
<p>On the whole, Demonschool feels well-polished and thoughtfully constructed: a huge relief after the game’s multiple delays!</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Krafton <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-owner-krafton-outlines-plans-to-transform-into-an-ai-first-company">affirmed its commitment to becoming an "<em>AI-first</em>" company</a>, the latest pre-trial document in the legal dispute between the co-founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds alleges that Krafton's chief executive officer, Changham Kim, looked to ChatGPT to see if there was a way out of paying developers at Unknown Worlds their <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that started this whole debacle.</p>



<p>The saga between the co-founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) and Krafton is one of 2025's longer and more surprising stories. It's doubtful that anyone could have predicted that we'd get the most legal drama from a case that has everything an onlooker could ask for; high financial stakes, the concept of a big company versus a small band of creators, and a fandom caught in the middle, unsure of which side to believe.</p>



<p>Krafton has made several claims about the co-founders, including that they abandoned their roles at Unknown Worlds, that they had stolen from Krafton and from Unknown Worlds, that they would have willingly sabotaged the reputation of the studio they founded just to receive a big payout.</p>



<p>The co-founders have hit Krafton with allegations of their own, like alleging that Krafton management was purposely sabotaging Unknown Worlds to delay Subnautica 2's early access launch in the hopes of Unknown Worlds missing its window to earn the $250 million bonus, and that CEO Changham Kim even admitted to the co-founders that it would be "<em>disastrous</em>" and <em>"hugely embarrassing</em>" for Krafton if it were to pay Unknown Worlds the massive bonus.</p>



<p>There's a full recap of events at the bottom of this article, with bullet points listing everything that has happened so far, with links to our coverage of it all if you want to catch up. For now, we'll stick with what's new, which deals in particular with that last allegation from the co-founders about Krafton CEO Changham Kim.</p>



<p>Though Krafton denies that Kim admitted it would be a financial disaster for Krafton should it have to pay the bonus, the pre-trial brief (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">publicly available via Game Developer</a>) alleges that Krafton took direct steps to avoid paying the bonus not just for financial reasons, but because Kim felt it would be "<em>a professional embarrassment</em>" and that he and Krafton would be seen as "<em>a pushover</em>" if it paid the bonus. </p>



<p>The attempt to avoid the bonus was allegedly called "<em>Project X,"</em> and the brief also alleges that firing the co-founders was part of Kim's attempts to avoid paying the bonus. Kim even went so far as to ask ChatGPT if there was a way out of paying the bonus, which tracks considering Krafton is trying to front itself as an AI and Generative AI-forward company.</p>



<p>"<em>Desperate to avoid such a professional embarrassment</em>," the pre-trial brief reads, "<em>Kim obsessed over finding a way to avoid Krafton's obligation to pay the earnout. [Maria] Park told Kim that 'it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be 'difficult to cancel the earn-out.' But Kim was undeterred</em>."</p>



<p>The brief goes on to list Krafton's milestone check-ins with Unknown Worlds as the first step in what Kim believed to be the solution to his alleged problem, delaying the launch of Subnautica 2. Krafton would allegedly use the check-ins as the foundation to start its campaign that the game should be delayed.</p>



<p>That was only the beginning of 'Project X,' though, as the brief further alleges that Krafton's executive class was essentially planning a coordinated campaign to avoid paying the earnout by any and all means available to them, including seizing control of Unknown Worlds' website and social media channels and embarking on a "<em>Take-Over Scenario</em>" backup plan if the co-founders did not agree to Krafton's attempts to alter the earnout deal.</p>



<p>The brief also goes after one of Krafton's main claims about the co-founders, which is that they were allegedly abandoning their posts. Krafton has tried to use Charlie Cleveland's involvement in filmmaking as proof that he wasn't doing his job, but the pre-trial brief includes Slack messages that allegedly prove Krafton was fully aware of Cleveland's filmmaking efforts and was even considering making them an official part of his role <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/subnautica-2-could-be-getting-a-tv-show-or-movie/">as the potential for a Subnautica film grew</a>.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, nothing in this pre-trial brief from the co-founders' legal team looks good for Krafton, though that's also what it's supposed to do. For Krafton's part, <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-chatgpt-2000644792">in a statement shared with Kotaku</a>, the company denies the claims in the pre-trial brief and claims that its first commitment has always been to deliver "<em>the best possible game to Subnautica fans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>At the heart of every decision Krafton makes are the fans who deserve the best possible experience. Krafton made leadership changes at Unknown Worlds when the now-former executives focused on other priorities rather than </em><em>Subnautica 2</em>," the statement reads<em>. "Despite Krafton offering to extend the former executives’ earnout period if they returned to their positions, the former executives refused to return to work, and improperly retained hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents both just before and after they were terminated." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, they failed to preserve certain files after their employment ended. Through this court process, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to </em><em>Subnautica</em>’s fans. Krafton will continue to present the evidence proving that the former executives did not comply with their duties as the legal proceedings move forward."</p>



<p>Needless to say, this will be an extremely interesting case to follow once it gets to trial. We'll keep you updated on it as it continues to evolve.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>



<li>On September 24, new motions from Krafton alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/">the founders stole what Krafton called "<em>effectively, a blueprint</em>"</a> for Subnautica in an attempt to further its argument that the co-founders intended to release Subnautica 2 on their own.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve developed a sixth sense for old video game cartridges. I can spot them at flea markets and thrift stores, spy them hidden behind stacks in used book stores. It happened after I first bought <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">an Analogue Pocket</a>, when the hunt for new and interesting Game Boy games became as important as actually playing them. Now my attention has turned to the Nintendo 64. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18">Analogue’s long-delayed take on the console</a> — dubbed the Analogue 3D — might just be the most premium way there is to play N64 games, making it ideal for collectors.</p><p>After playing with the Analogue 3D over the last week, I’ve found a new appreciation for Nintendo’s oft-neglected console. I’ve played through games for the first time and revisited old favorites, all with the benefit of modern conveniences like wireless controllers and 4K visuals.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODIyODk0"><p><span>$<!-- -->250</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Old games look great</li><li>Compatible with a huge number of games</li><li>Lots of customization options</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No controller in the box</li><li>Early 3D games don’t always age very well</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Analogue first made waves in 2015 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/26/8850397/analogue-nt-premium-nes-nintendo-console">the Analogue NT</a>, a modern re-creation of the NES. Since then, it has done the same for platforms like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, all of which are designed to play old cartridges — which can cost anywhere from a few bucks to a few hundred, depending what you’re buying — on modern televisions. The consoles use field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, technology to function just as the original hardware did.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Analogue 3D takes this concept and applies it to the N64. There are easier and cheaper ways to play many of these games, such as with the Nintendo Switch Online subscription or through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132984/delta-free-emulator-nintendo-gba-n64-iphone-app-store-us">emulators on the App Store</a>. But, much like how a high-end record player preserves the physical element of listening to music, a console like the Analogue 3D offers a different and more tactile experience. It’s one that I’ve found creates a deeper connection with what I’m playing.</p><p>The $249.99 console looks like a slightly streamlined N64 — it’s available in both black and white — complete with a cartridge slot on top and four controller ports on the front, along with “power” and “reset” buttons. On the back there’s an SD card slot, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI port, which allows you to play it on a modern TV, unlike the original N64 hardware. It comes with an HDMI cable, USB cable, power supply, and a 16GB SD card preinstalled with the console’s operating system. It doesn’t come with a controller, but it supports the original wired N64 gamepads if you have some lying around, and various wireless options. I tested it using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d">8bitdo’s $39.99 Bluetooth option</a>, which crams the three-prong N64 controller into something resembling an Xbox pad.</p><p>The console outputs at up to 4K, and is region-free, meaning you can play games originally released in any territory, and the company says that it has “100 percent compatibility” with every N64 game. I obviously wasn’t able to test that, but I did throw a few oddballs at it — like a Japan-only J.League soccer game that I snagged for $10 — and didn’t run into any issues. In fact, one of the best parts of the system’s barebones interface is that it recognizes cartridges you pop in, so you can build up a digital list of your library. You can then use this function to customize aspects like the visual output for each game. Analogue says other features are coming in a future update, including quick save states and screenshots.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But it’s those visual settings that really show the power of the Analogue 3D. Over the years, the N64 has proven to be a difficult console to emulate; even Nintendo messes it up sometimes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">with games that have ugly textures or are missing effects like fog</a> with few customization options. The Analogue 3D goes in the opposite direction with five different output modes, and I’ve found myself swapping between them depending on the kind of game I’m playing.</p><p>For instance, one of the visual modes is called “clean,” and it’s exactly what it sounds like: the original game rendered in high resolution with bright colors and sharp edges. This became my go-to for bright and colorful games like <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which really popped with life on my TV. But for other games, this more pure and clean output ruined the vibe. Titles like <em>Star Wars: Shadows</em> <em>of the Empire</em> and <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>, for instance, use a lot of muted colors and effects like fog to create a darker, moodier tone. That energy was lost with the “clean” option. But as soon as I swapped over to BVM mode — or Broadcast Video Monitor, which Analogue calls “reference-grade for N64” — all those elements flooded back in. There I was, in the bleak Ord Mantell Junkyard, hunting down Boba Fett just like I did three decades ago, trying to spy drones flying through the fog.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>There are other modes, which you can swap on the fly, including one that mimics the look of a CRT monitor, along with further customization options with names like “gamma transfer” and “beam convergence,” which I admit are a bit beyond me. I had no problem finding the best output for each particular game. You have a lot more control here than when playing the same games with Nintendo’s subscription, which offers one solitary CRT filter.</p><p>The one caveat I’ll make here has little to do with the Analogue 3D hardware and more to do with the platform it’s tied to. The company’s previous consoles all focused on 2D games, which typically age a lot better than early 3D titles. Even though I played many of these N64 games when they first came out, I still found myself struggling with some of the 3D platforming segments<em>, </em>and, boy, did I miss the lack of a free camera to help me look around these three-dimensional worlds. It was even harder for games that were completely new to me. Again, this isn’t the Analogue 3D’s fault, but it is something to consider if you’re looking to invest in a library of cartridges.</p><p>But, for me at least, this has also made those cartridge hunts all the more satisfying. Finding something cool and surprising, and then spending time learning how to play it, gives me a chance to engage with these games on a deeper level. Unlike when I’m choosing from dozens or more games on a digital platform, where I can quickly swap to something else if I’m bored, a device like the Analogue 3D and the cartridges it plays force a level of focus that I often feel is missing from my life, as so many things vie for my attention.</p><p>I doubt I’d have given <em>Jikkyo J. League: Perfect Striker</em> a second thought through Nintendo Switch Online. But now that I have the cartridge, it’s become a multiplayer favorite in this house.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64]]></content:encoded>

Created by Polish developers Sombrero Labs, it's about making old, broken, patently unsafe cars look like new-ish, sellable ones by means of myriad methods. You can, for example, cut cars in half and solder the least rusty bits together, or paint tyres to look fresher, or photoshop some sparkle into your carefully angled phone pictures, or use an electric screwdriver to wind back the miles-counting... thingy. The best part from my perspective is that prior knowledge of actual car functioning appears inessential, to the point of being frowned upon. After all, the more you know about cars, the more you will understand why you shouldn't let anybody drive <em>these</em> cars.
</p>
<p>
If you do drive, I imagine you might enjoy this because it kindles memories of cars you shouldn't have bought as a foolish youth. Cars with suspiciously placed floor mats, and a raccoon nesting under the hood which the seller persuaded you was merely an atypically rabid and flea-ridden intake manifold. He probably charged you an extra £50 for that raccoon. Read more about Totally Legit Wheeler Seller on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3875690/Totally_Legit_Wheeler_Seller/">Steam</a>.

              <p>Losing track of your items, especially when you’re on the go, is never fun. AirTags are a great way to always keep an eye on the whereabouts of your essentials. But since most of us have more than one thing worth keeping tabs on, getting just a single AirTag might not cut it. Thankfully, Amazon is making it easier to snap a few without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Right now, the retailer is offering the Apple AirTag 4-Pack for just $65, which is a 34% discount from its original price.</a> That brings it down to around $16 per AirTag, which is practically a steal considering the peace of mind these bring. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but we can’t say how long it will last. It’s best to get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Track Your Essentials</h2>
<p>An AirTag is a coin-like gadget that you can attach to your essentials in multiple ways. You can use an AirTag accessory (like a keychain or loop) to hook it onto your keys or luggage, and even just slide one in your wallet or backpack. Activating these is quite straightforward; just remove the battery tab from the AirTag, bring it closer to your iPhone or iPad, and tap Connect on the prompt that appears. Follow the on-screen instructions to register the AirTag to your Apple ID, and you will be all set!</p>
<p>Once you’re done setting things up, you can use the Find My app to locate your essentials. The Precision Finding features lead you right to your nearby AirTag, and the app even lets you trigger a sound from the built-in speaker to help you find it. For items that are further away, the Find My network can help pinpoint their location anonymously.</p>



<p>Still can’t seem to find your valuables? You can also put an AirTag in Lost Mode, which sends you a notification as soon as it detects the AirTag. You can even share the tag with up to five people, or provide its details to a third party (like an airline) to help recover lost luggage.</p>
<p>The replaceable battery lasts up to a year. AirTags are also IP67 water and dust-resistant, meaning these tiny but mighty gadgets can survive not-so-ideal weather conditions well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This deal brings the price down of this 4-pack bundle to just $65, after a nice $34 discount, which makes the purchase much more affordable.</a></p>

                <p>The developers behind the newly launched episodic game Dispatch have weighed in with their thoughts on artificial intelligence in gaming, saying it might help with production but not creativity.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GI.biz</a>, AdHoc boss Nick Herman said AI cannot achieve what actors Jeffrey Wright and Aaron Paul did in Dispatch. "He brought something to that character that we weren't expecting. I mean, his performance and Aaron's performance and our whole cast are bringing performances and elevating the material in a way that you're just not going to get [with AI]."</p><p>He added: "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVgX7b1N8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Executive producer Michael Choung went on to say that whatever AdHoc creates, it's "got to be made by people." The studio is "looking at AI" and "monitoring" what it can do to help the studio, but right now the results are not convincing AdHoc to push into AI like other studios are.</p><p>"It seems to be having a lot of trouble trying to get to a 'good enough' spot. And 'good enough' for us is the enemy," he said. "Also we're not getting up every morning and talking to ourselves like, 'Hey, what if we did this with less people? What's the lowest number of people we can use to make this thing?' This is like not anything that we're too concerned with."</p><p>Choung added that he does not judge people and studios for using AI in their processes, but for AdHoc, "It just doesn't make a ton of sense" to use AI right now.</p><p>In other news, PUBG creator Brendan Greene recently made headlines when he said he felt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-says-he-is-really-heartened-about-the-backlash-to-ai-in-gaming/1100-6536304/" data-ref-id="1100-6536304">"really heartened" to see the backlash to AI in gaming.</a> He's not the only person speaking out against the further adoption of AI in gaming, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">a US lawmaker recently called out Call of Duty over AI.</a> One of 2025's most successful games, Arc Raiders, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-use-of-ai-is-good-for-gaming-helldivers-boss-says/1100-6536274/" data-ref-id="1100-6536274">embraced AI.</a></p><p>Dispatch is a $30 episodic adventure game for PS5 and PC developed by a team of people who formerly worked at Telltale and Ubisoft. It released in late October and sold more than 1 million copies in its first 10 days. Choung told GI.biz that Dispatch is on track to reach the games lifetime sales projection in three months, though he did not provide any specific numbers.</p>

            <p>The team behind Netflix anime Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft has given us a peek at what's in store for season two.</p>
<p>The new trailer features Lara along with Sam - a character first introduced by Rhianna Pratchett in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot - getting into all sorts of japes. This includes Lara punching a shark on the nose, much like she did in the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider film Cradle of Life. They also take some time to drink coffee, because who wants to raid a tomb without a hit of caffeine to grease the axels?</p>
<p>Speaking of axels, we also see Lara using her twin climbing axes, another key piece of equipment from the rebooted Survivor timeline. You can check out the trailer for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft below.</p>

<p>"Lara races across the globe to uncover ancient African relics before a techno-visionary bent on playing god uses them to unleash worldwide destruction," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell returns for the second season as the voice of Lara Croft, as does Earl Baylon as Jonah. Joining the cast this season is Karen Fukuhara (The Boys, Suicide Squad) as Sam.</p>
<p>Season two of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will be available on Netflix on 11th December. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">season will be the series' last</a>.</p>

            <p>Cheers have been heard across the internet, with jubilations that, yes, Hytale has been saved from cancellation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">Development on Hytale started back in 2015</a>, and the game soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">gaining investment by Riot Games and eventually getting acquired</a> by the gaming giant, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">the game was cancelled in June of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, that wasn't the end of the story, and last night, original Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that he had acquired Hytale from Riot Games, calling it "a new and exciting chapter" for those involved.</p>

<p>"Huge thanks to Riot for working with me to make this happen. They wanted what's best for players, and that's for us to eventually play the game," Collins-Laflamme wrote. "This game has always been close to my heart, and I'm excited to bring it back home.</p><p>"Real talk: Hytale isn't some polished AAA release waiting in the wings. It's messy. It's janky. And there's a lot of work to be done. My plan? Get it out to you as soon as possible. No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special.</p>
<p>"Thanks for believing in Hytale. Time to get to work."</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">game's website</a>, Collins-Laflamme again thanked Riot, adding the team was now "going back to the original vision" for Hytale. "We are fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years," the developer said. He added an early access date for Hytale will be announced in the "coming days", so stay tuned.</p>

<p>In its own statement regarding Hytale's sale, <a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1990480588797849881">Riot said</a>: "After evaluating multiple offers, we've reached an agreement to return Hytale to @simon_hypixel, giving this community its best shot at experiencing a revised version of the game.</p>
<p>"Wishing the team the best of luck for what's ahead."</p>
<p>When news of the game's cancellation first made the rounds, a gigantic art piece with "#Save Hytale" was painted on WPlace over Santa Monica. A community effort by fans of the cancelled sandbox game, this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-fans-paint-savehytale-art-over-riot-games-office-on-wplace-protesting-its-cancellation">digital display happened to hover over the Riot Games office</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> Reforged, a big update to 2005 MMORPG Guild Wars that's designed to make it a lot more convenient to play on modern hardware, is set to hit Steam on December 3rd. Steam Deck verification, modern controller support, and an interface revamp are among the tweaks developers ArenaNet and 2weeks have made, with the possibility of further "improvements" down the road being teased.</p>

<p>"We believe that even with all the advancements and innovations of the last two decades, Guild Wars has a lot to offer: an enchanted world of limitless adventure, a deep and flexible skill-based combat system, PvE and PvP challenges of all types, and more," ArenaNet wrote in Reforged's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284210/view/634572213702362037?l=english">Steam announcement</a>. "Guild Wars Reforged begins with a series of updates to Guild Wars that will be completely free to existing players and make it easier than ever for new players to experience it all firsthand."</p>
<p>Reforged, which'll be free to folks who already own the original Guild Wars, lumps Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall together into one package at the new price of $19.99 / whatever the your currency equivalent turns out to be. The aforementioned Steam Deck verification, an interface with larger text options, plus support for controller and high DPI displays come in that revamped box. There's a new quest tracking system and on-screen guide to the controls.</p><p>It's also had a bit of a visual facelift with "dynamic sky bloom effects, new ambient occlusion, and lighting updates" designed to take advantage of modern graphics cards, while some revamped textures and positional audio support round things out. Well, for now at least. "Guild Wars Reforged isn't about a one-time update", ArenaNet wrote, adding that they see this as a "renewing our commitment to the game" with help from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-studio-2weeks-to-focus-on-prototyping-and-bite-sized-games">2weeks</a>, a small studio some former ArenaNet staff formed last year.</p>
<p>"Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria," said 2weeks co-founder Brandon Dillon, who spent 11 years at ArenaNet and has since worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grim-fandango-remastered">Grim Fandango Remastered</a> at Double Fine. "Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come."</p>
<p>It's nice to see Guild Wars getting some TLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guild-wars-1-development-to-be-halted-automated">all these years on</a>, especially since sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>'s in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">top MMOs list</a>. Plus, it's an excuse to go back and read some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guild-wars-4th-birthday-eric-flannum-interview">retro Guild Wars writings</a> from the founderfolk if you fancy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-chase-card-in-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg%E2%80%99s-phantasmal-flames-including-that-charizard.1356928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest set in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">controversy-embroiled</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, Phantasmal Flames, is now out. And, as is becoming traditional for a November release, contains a brand new Charizard card that’s going to drive even more people (and scalpers) to the hobby. In this case, it’s the beloved Mega Charizard X, the gigantic blue variant appearing in both a stunning Special Illustration Rare <em>and</em> in one of the new-fangled gold foils. And yes, both are already fetching ridiculous prices. But in a stark change, they’re the only two that are.</p> <p>I’m pleased to report that once again, if you’re actually able to find any packs to buy, Phantasmal Flames <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">continues Mega Evolution’s new-found generosity</a> when it comes to pull rates. Of the 55 packs we were kindly sent by The Pokémon Company, I pulled an extraordinary 24 ex or better cards, of which 13 were full art or better. Compared to the three year run of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets, this is a dramatic improvement, with pretty much a 50:50 chance of not getting what is derogatively known as a “dud pack.” (For those wanting to play the game, there’s no such thing as a dud pack, and of course it’s these people who are most hurt by the current <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">year-long period of scarcity</a>.)</p>

 <p>However, the cost of this does very much appear to be the pull rates on Special Illustration Rares. As with Mega Evolution, Phantasmal Flames has made these most desirable cards extraordinarily unlikely to appear, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">the new iteration of gold foils proving farcically rare</a>. With Mega Evolutions, this drove prices to new, all-time highs, but in the first few days of Phantasmal Flames things don’t appear to be nearly so out of control. The Charizards are, of course, outrageously priced at $600 and $800 each, but we then see a <em>massive</em> drop for third place, with Dawn’s SIR going for $60. That’s a&nbsp;<em>very</em> normal price for an SIR, and in a pretty small set with only five of them to find, it suggests that people are simply ripping packs for the Zards and caring about little else.</p>

 <p>That becomes even more stark when you notice that fourth place goes to Mega Charizard X ex again, but this time in its much more common Ultra Rare form (I pulled one of these, as it happens) at around $57, the other four SIRs following for as little as $30. (Yes, $30 for a piece of cardboard remains ridiculous, but then I just spent&nbsp;<em>way</em> more than that on the Crown Zenith Leafeon VSTAR, so who am I to talk?)</p>

 <p>Is this a good sign that cards like the Mega Sharpedo ex and Rotom ex SIRs aren’t going for megabucks? Or is it, and I do worry it’s this, that the SIRs in Phantasmal Flames just aren’t that appealing? The art is wonderful on both of those examples, but Sharpedo is rarely at the top of anyone’s favorite Pokémon list, and there really are a lot of pretty Rotom cards already. Then there’s the complete mess of the Mega Lopunny ex (see the card in the gallery), and, well, that’s all of them. The more common (and thus always cheaper) Illustration Rares are where the truly wonderful art appears in this set, with a stunning Zacian, Piplup, Flygon, Wooper, Togedemaru, Ludicolo and Ambipom to find, most of them selling during the peak price of the opening week for under $10! Meowth is the only one of the IRs that’s caught on at around $30 (with Piplup managing an impressive $19).</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-price-mega-lucario-gardevoir-hyper-rare-2000633650">Compare this with Mega Evolution</a>, where the tenth highest priced card was going for $50, and the SIRs fetching around $300 each, and it’s a striking shift. So, with all that said, click on for the cards you want to chase if you’re looking for value in Phantasmal Flames, but know that if you’re after the cards to play in a deck, most can be picked up in their basic form for under a dollar. (Even Mega Charizard X ex’s regular form “only” fetches about $5.) Again,&nbsp;<em>if</em> you can actually find packs to open.</p>

Solid-state drives (SSDs) eliminate mechanical parts entirely, using flash memory that reads and writes data at speeds ten times faster than traditional HDDs.</p>
<p>The SanDisk 2TB Extreme portable SSD delivers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">NVMe performance in a pocket-sized package, now sitting at $162 instead of the usual $209 price tag.</a> This marks an <strong>all-time low</strong> for this capacity, with Amazon wanting to clear inventory before Black Friday ends.</p>

<h2>1,050MB/s Read Speeds</h2>
<p>This SanDisk SSD pushes <strong>read speeds up to 1,050MB/s and write speeds of about 1,000MB/s over its USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection</strong>. These numbers are indicative of real performance you can expect to see in the real world when transferring files, not some theoretical maximum that never materializes. A 4K movie file of roughly 25GB copies in about 25 seconds and that same transfer takes over three minutes on external hard drives.</p>
<p>Inside the drive,<strong> NVMe technology delivers this performance by using direct PCIe lanes</strong> rather than the SATA bottleneck that constrains older SSDs. The controller manages data efficiently, maintaining consistent speeds even during sustained transfers that would cause cheaper drives to throttle. This you’ll notice most when backing up large folders or copying entire game libraries, as the speeds keep steady rather than starting fast and degrading over time.</p>



<p>Two terabytes stores around <strong>500 hours of 1080p video, 200,000 high-resolution photos, or 20 modern AAA game installs</strong>. This tier makes sense for video editors who are working with 4K footage, photographers who have large RAW libraries they’re managing, and gamers who simply refuse to uninstall old titles. The drive serves as a Time Machine backup target for Mac users or a Windows backup destination and SSD speeds mean your automated backups will finish faster without stressing your system. External game storage works flawlessly with both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, from storing games on the drive to <strong>playing titles directly from it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IP65 water and dust resistance</strong> means complete dust ingress protection and protection against water jets from any direction. The rating means the drive survives rain exposure, dusty environments, or even an accidental spill without immediately destroying your data. You can casually throw it in a backpack with water bottles, do shoots outdoors, or work in construction sites without constant anxiety about the environmental damage it may cause.</p>



<p>The USB-C connectivity works with modern laptops, tablets, and phones via the<strong> provided USB-C to USB-C cable</strong>. A USB-C to USB-A adapter is included in the box to connect to older computers that have traditional USB ports. The drive pulls its power directly from the USB connection with no need for separate power adapters, which keeps true plug-and-play simplicity across devices.</p>
<p>The drives come formatted as exFAT, which works<strong> universally across Windows, Mac, and Linux without reformatting</strong>. You can reformat to NTFS for Windows-specific use or APFS for Mac-optimized performance if the need calls for it. Operating temperature ranges from 0°C to 45°C during active use, covering most environments you’d realistically use the drive in. Non-operating storage tolerance goes from -20°C to 85°C.</p>
<p>You’re paying here about $0.08 per gigabyte at $162 for real NVMe speeds and a rugged build. Samsung, Crucial, and WD portable SSDs with similar specifications often sell between $200 and $300.</p>
