            <p>
Banana has taken Steam by storm recently, yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banana-clicking-game-now-9th-most-popular-of-all-time-on-steam-knocks-baldurs-gate-3-out-of-top-10">knocking Baldur's Gate 3 out of the top 10 most popular games on Valve's platform</a> (in terms of peak concurrent players).
</p>
<p>
In Banana, players click on the image of a banana - or simply leave the software running - to eventually get a banana dropped into their Steam inventory. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-100000-people-are-currently-playing-a-steam-game-where-you-click-a-banana">As we previously reported</a>, these bananas can be sold in Steam's marketplace, with some going for pennies while others have a much higher asking price. 
</p>
<p>
Since Banana started gaining popularity on Steam, there has been speculation this is all some kind of scam. This concern was exacerbated when it transpired one of the developers behind Banana had previously been involved in a "Steam market 'bitcoin' scam/bug". However, other team members have assured the community the game is not a scam, and more content will be coming soon.

<p>
In a message shared on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1225691328998936576/1236959941097558056">Discord</a> last night, Banana's CM/Co-Owner aestheticspartan released the following statement:
 
"As you all have heard by now Theselions used to be involved in a steam market 'bitcoin' scam/bug. We did not know about this until recent videos started to point this out and we had a talk almost immediately with the whole team about the situation. We gave him the chance to explain the situation to us and we know he is showing remorse and is sorry about what happened in the past."
</p>
<p>
Aestheticspartan said the Banana team has "parted ways" with Theselions because of this revelation, adding his "inventory has been cleared of any valuable bananas that could concern and/or worry the community". 
</p>
<p>
The Banana developer went on to state there is "no scamming/scam" going on, and the remaining members are currently working to update the game. "We cannot wait to turn this game into something bigger and better than just a clicker game," they wrote. "Please stay on the lookout as we have been and still are working on a large amount of updates to improve the game and let you all do much more with your bananas."
</p>
<p>
In an earlier conversation with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/gaming/why-clicker-game-banana-the-legal-infinite-money-glitch-is-going-viral-on-steam/ar-BB1nPmuR">Polygon</a>, developer team member Hery admitted the game has a bot problem. "Since the game takes basically one percent to no resources of your PC, people are abusing up to 1000 alternative accounts in order to get Rarer drops or at least drops in bulk," they told the publication. This would not be a surprise, given Banana's monumental Steam numbers.
</p>
<p>
However, at the time of their conversation, they assured Polygon everything was above board. "I do believe that the reason why it mostly caught on is because it's a legal 'Infinite money glitch,'" Hery said. "Users make money out of a free game while selling free virtual items."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has reached out to members of Banana's team and Valve for further comment on the current discourse surrounding the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/even-the-elden-ring-manga-author-is-taking-time-off-to-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=even-the-elden-ring-manga-author-is-taking-time-off-to-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been keeping up with <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>‘s spin-off manga, <em>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</em>, you may be disappointed to know that it will be skipping next month’s update. However, the author has a perfectly understandable and relatable reason… he wants to play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em>.</p> <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">For anyone who wasn’t aware, <em>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</em> is an adaptation of the game, but is more of a comedy story starring an original protagonist. It’s been getting new chapters biweekly; in fact, a new one dropped earlier today. As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-manga-author-goes-on-hiatus-to-play-the-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, author Nikiichi Tobita has opted to take some time off to enjoy the new<em> Elden Ring</em> DLC, which is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/heres-when-you-can-start-playing-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-every-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch tomorrow</a> (or on Friday depending on your timezone). This means the manga won’t be getting a new chapter on July 19 as initially expected.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="848" data-injectable="true">You can’t be mad with him for his decision. How many of us have booked time off work to play a hot, new video game? How many of us have booked time off specifically for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>? People have been clamouring for more <em>Elden Ring</em> since the game launched in 2022 and, based on all the reviews, it sounds like the wait will be worth it. Plus, writing and drawing manga chapters on a regular basis must be exhausting work, so Tobita is probably due a break anyway. Playing the DLC may also give him new ideas for future manga chapters.</p>
 <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="false">Would you believe this isn’t even the only <em>Elden Ring</em> manga? Just last week, publisher Bandai Namco announced a second one titled <em>Elden Ring: Distant Stories from The Lands Between</em> (<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202406/04340370.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Famitsu</a>) and while it’ll also be a comedy, the focus will be on the various NPCs players have met in the Lands Between. Serialisation will begin on July 4, but there’s no mention of an official English translation. Since <em>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</em> has been localised for Western fans, hopefully this second manga will follow suit.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal-engine-5-4-forgotten-cemetery-tech-demo-struggles-to-run-smoothly-at-native-4k-resolution-on-an-rtx-4080.905703/</guid>

			<p>Judging from another Unreal Engine 5.4 tech demo, native 4K resolution is increasingly looking like a resolution that only the absolute best GPUs will be able to handle with decent performance.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmark PC</a> shared a new video showing the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/scans-cemetery-forgotten-churchyard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgotten Cemetery demo</a> created by Scans Factory running at 4K and 1440p resolutions, Epic settings on an RTX 4080 GPU. As seen in other tech demos powered by the latest version of the engine by Epic, the NVIDIA GPU, which is still among the most powerful GPUs on the market, is not able to handle native 4K resolution properly in both daytime and nighttime only managing to hit the 50, 60 FPS mark in a few scenarios. Performance is definitely better at 1440p resolution, although framerate is not particularly stable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.4 Forgotten Cemetery Tech Demo - A Glimpse Into Next-Gen Graphics | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iWjkpLwym8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While these Unreal Engine 5.4 are definitely not optimized, they do show that the engine still needs plenty of work to reach an acceptable level of performance. The latest version of the engine brings significant performance improvements, but stability still leaves something to be desired, according to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-performance-improvement-frame-time/">analysis</a> shared last month.</p>
<p>Besides performance improvements, Unreal Engine 5.4 brings a new Nanite Adaptive Tessellation option, Heterogenous Volumes, which can produce realistic and dynamic smoke and clouds, improved Temporal Super Resolution upscaling, easier implementation of AI and machine learning tools, performance and shared compilation improvements and much more. More information on the engine can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

<p data-characters="393" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When you think of horror gaming, chances are you picture <em>Resident Evil</em> in one of its many forms. From its humble beginnings as a puzzle-based zombie game that took cues from <em>Alone in the Dark</em> and <em>Sweet Home</em>, Capcom’s survival series has become almost the final word in scary video gaming. There’s not much that comes close to it in terms of worldwide success and brand recognition.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">With that, I’m going to attempt to <strong>rank all the mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> games</strong> that have been released over the decades (almost 30!) based purely on their sales figures. Now, there are a couple of things I want to clear up before I get started.</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">First off: there seems to be some debate about whether the likes of <em>Revelations</em> and <em>Revelations 2</em> count as “main games” in the series. As such, I won’t be discussing them, as no one seems to agree. However, <em>Code Veronica</em> is unanimous when it comes to classing it as a canon <em>RE</em> game. So, in the list it goes.</p>
 <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">As for the sales numbers themselves, there doesn’t appear to be a consensus on that, either. It would make sense to use <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom’s own figures</a>, but they don’t match up with what other sources say. For example: it lists <em>RE4</em> (the original) numerous times, depending on the platform and release version. Given this, I’ll pull information from a number of places, but I will try to keep this as accurate as I can. Also, it ultimately doesn’t matter in the end. We’re all just trying to get through the week, yeah?</p>
 <h2 id="h-code-veronica-2000-2-54-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Code: Veronica</em> (2000) – 2.54 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">Taking place just before the military destruction of Raccoon city, <em>Code: Veronica</em> is smack-bang in between <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>3</em>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_%E2%80%93_Code:_Veronica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia entry</a> for the game refers to it as the “fourth main installment” in the series, though if you’re not familiar with the franchise, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a spinoff, seeing as it’s not a numbered game. I’ve made that mistake in the past.</p>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">It’s also considered one of the strongest entries, with pretty much universal acclaim across the board. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/resident-evil-code-veronica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> shows a review score of 94 and a user rating of 9.1 for the Dreamcast version. You’ll sometimes see it on lists of the top <em>Resident Evil</em> games of all time. With such praise, it’s no wonder there are high <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/capcom-confirms-more-resident-evil-remakes-are-on-the-way/">hopes that Capcom will remake <em>Code: Veronica</em></a> at some point.</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-3-nemesis-1999-3-50-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> (1999) – 3.50 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">I still have fond memories of being in my teens and playing the 1999 release of <em>Resident Evil 3</em>. I loved the second game, and the third entry was just as fantastic to me. I was terrified of the prospect of bumping into Nemesis at unexpected intervals, but my sweaty hands and greasy face (teenager, remember) fought bravely. And that was the last time I truly felt free. Sigh.</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Anyway…three and a half million in sales is definitely noteworthy, especially for a time when gaming wasn’t quite the behemoth industry it is today. <em>Nemesis</em> was the <a href="http://archive.thegia.com/news/0001/n27e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-best game in Japan for 1999</a> – where it was called <em>Last Escape</em> – according to data originally published by Famitsu. That placed it ahead of <em>Gran Turismo 2</em> and <em>Dino Crisis</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-2-1998-4-96-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 2</em> (1998) – 4.96 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Now we come to my favorite <em>Resident Evil</em> game of all time. Is this a nostalgia thing? Almost certainly, yes. But I still recall being blown away by its visuals and the fact that the game dropped you right in the middle of the action. Unheard of at the time, when I think about it. I played this game to death when it first came out, even attempting to unlock the ability to play as <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tofu_Survivor_(RE2)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tofu</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">Coming just a couple of years after the original, <em>RE2</em> seemed to fall just shy of its predecessor in terms of sales. But it absolutely (in my eyes, at least) took what made the first game such a hit and upped just about everything. Yes, two and a half decades later, it’s dated, but it’s a classic. But that first time Mr. X burst through a wall will go down as one of the most frightened I’ve ever been while playing a game.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-1996-5-08-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil</em> (1996) – 5.08 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">There’s some debate about when the “survival horror” genre actually began. One thing that most would agree on is that it didn’t start with the original <em>Resident Evil</em>. However, it’s generally considered the first game to be described as a survival horror. Some would consider 1992’s <em>Alone in the Dark</em> – which influenced <em>RE</em> – to be the first. But the term can retroactively describe even earlier releases, it seems.</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">That aside, it doesn’t detract from <em>Resident Evil</em>‘s impact on the gaming world. Its blend of exploration, puzzle solving, and a zombie infestation combined to make it one of the scariest games ever released at the time. For that alone, it’s gone down in the history books as probably the most important horror game of all time.</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-remake-2002-5-25-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil Remake</em> (2002) – 5.25 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">You could argue that this reimagining of the first <em>Resident Evil</em> installment was what kick-started Capcom’s keen interest in remaking the older games from scratch. However, this came out some 17 years before the <em>RE2</em> remake, which is a fact that hammers home just how long the series has been going for.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">This 2002 do-over of <em>RE</em> kept the third-person perspective and tank controls of its ancestor, but gave a boost to the visuals. It was a much darker version than the original, I found, but it retained the franchise’s position in the limelight a good few years before the fourth game would come along and absolutely smash the boundaries of survival horror.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-zero-2002-5-45-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil Zero</em> (2002) – 5.45 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom/</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">With the release of both a remake and a brand-new entry, 2002 was evidently a good year to be a <em>Resident Evil</em> fan. If you wanted to play the games in chronological order based on timeline, <em>Zero</em> would be the one to start with. Covering the events before the 1996 game, this one is a prequel and sees you playing as both Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen.</p>
 <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">Sadly, I never finished this one, though I did enjoy the fact that you could switch between both characters at a moment’s notice. This was something of a departure from previous <em>Resident Evil</em> games, where you typically played one campaign before playing the story again as someone else. Novel.</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-4-remake-2023-7-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> (2023) – 7 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">The numbers are starting to climb up, but we haven’t yet reached the tens of millions. Also, given that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> is the latest installment to be released – launching in March 2023 – this number is only going to change as time moves on. The previous entries on this list are probably not shifting many copies now, given their general ages.</p> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="766" data-injectable="true">The original <em>RE4</em> is easily considered one of – if not <em>the</em> – best game in the series. So, you can imagine the pressure Capcom was under to make the remake nothing short of stellar. Fortunately, the studio pulled it off, bringing everything fans loved about the 2005 release, but — actually, you don’t need me to tell you how good it is. No doubt many of you have played the remake already.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-3-remake-2020-8-70-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 3 Remake</em> (2020) – 8.70 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">Don’t be too surprised that this has (so far) sold more than <em>RE4</em>. Remember, the latter has only been out just over a year, while the remake of <em>Resident Evil 3</em> has had a good while longer to rack up the numbers. It’s not quite as high in terms of sales figures as some of the other games, but it’s still a sizeable chunk, especially for such a short game.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">That was largely the main criticism of <em>RE3</em>. That, and it dialed back the puzzles a tad. But even for a short horror title, it was able to capture the essence of its 1999 counterpart and inject some much-needed modernity into the mix. Of course, it also kept the Nemesis antagonist, which would have been criminal to leave out.</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-village-2021-10-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil Village</em> (2021) – 10 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Now we’re into the juicy numbers. It was very recently that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-village-hits-10-million-sales-the-fastest-in-the-series-to-do-so/">Capcom announced <em>Resident Evil Village</em> had smashed 10 million copies</a>, and is the fastest game in the whole series to achieve this. Much like <em>RE4 Remake</em>, we can expect the eighth installment to keep racking up those figures over time. But we can already see how successful the series continues to be after all these years.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true"><em>Village</em> is – in a way – the second installment that is trying to do something different with the franchise, much like <em>RE7</em> before it. Gone are the classic zombies and third-person camera angles. Replaced instead by a much more involved perspective, grittier visuals, and a return to form for gamers who just want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-villages-lady-dimitrescu-is-more-than-just-a-fan-art-flavor-of-the-month/">ogle a digital matriarch</a>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-6-2012-13-10-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 6</em> (2012) – 13.10 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">This one might be a surprise to some. If you know the general trajectory of <em>Resident Evil</em> quality, you’ll be familiar with the sixth game’s reputation. Pretty much tacking on horror as an aside, the series was, by this point, almost entirely about bombastic action than tension. This 2012 installment is typically regarded as one of the weakest of the mainline games.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Or so I thought. The fact that it’s sold over 13 million copies must be a testament to how well it did upon release, or some time after it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221040/Resident_Evil_6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> shows it as “mostly positive” for reviews, while <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/resident-evil-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> has it down as 67 out of 100. It seems weird, then, that the sales figures appear to be at odds with the overall reception of <em>RE6</em>. But that’s show business, baby!</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-4-2002-13-20-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 4</em> (2002) – 13.20 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">I’m going to confess something right now. Please don’t hate me for this, but…I don’t consider the original <em>Resident Evil 4</em> to be the best in the series. I know, I know. It’s sacrilege. But I think it’s because I played it many years after it was released. By this point, the control scheme felt outdated and the voice acting felt too cheesy for something that had moved into darker and more sincere territory.</p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it. It’s a great <em>Resident Evil</em> game. Just not my favorite. But I could still see why everyone loved it so much. Its switch to an over-the-shoulder perspective was genre-defining and while being more action-orientated would be the later games’ detriment, it worked out pretty nicely in this case. It’s just a shame I was late to the party to truly appreciate it.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-7-biohazard-2017-13-30-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> (2017) – 13.30 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">When I first saw the teasers and trailers for this, I was massively excited. Capcom was rewriting their own rules for <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and it was a decision that helped breathe new life into the waning series. It had lashings of <em>P.T.</em> (long-dead by this point) and <em>Outlast</em>, which did nothing to quell my thirst for this game.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Going back to its horror roots, <em>Biohazard</em> seemed to be a way to undo what the last two or three entries had done. While <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is my favorite overall for both its gameplay and trip down memory lane, <em>RE7</em> is easily my favorite of the modern games.</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-2-remake-2019-13-90-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 2 Remake</em> (2019) – 13.90 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">While we mustn’t forget the 2002 remake of <em>Resident Evil</em>, the 2019 modern take on <em>RE2</em> can be said to be the start of a new era for Capcom in terms of remaking classic games. Nearly 14 million in sales over the past few years is probably all the evidence you need to understand just how huge this game was upon release.</p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="767" data-injectable="true">Obviously, the game itself played a huge part in that popularity. Had it been a straight remake of the 1998 release, it probably wouldn’t have been as well-received aside from some appeal to older fans. But bringing back the over-the-shoulder camera from <em>RE4</em>, adding Mr. X from the offset, switching the puzzles and overall level design around to keep things fresh are the hallmarks of a great remake that still hits that nostalgia spot.</p>
 <h2 id="h-resident-evil-5-2009-14-60-million" data-injectable="false"><em>Resident Evil 5</em> (2009) – 14.60 million</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam/Capcom.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">Much like <em>RE6</em>, I was surprised to see that not only had the fifth <em>Resident Evil</em> game sold so many millions of copies, it’s actually the highest-selling entry in the series. Right at the start of this article, I posted a link to Capcom’s list of its top releases. I went through to double check these numbers. It turns out, yes, it does indeed add up to 14.6 million when you include all versions of the game.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">I never played <em>RE5</em> beyond the demo. The fact that it had a co-op mode – in <em>Gears of War</em> fashion – was a neat idea, but it’s shift towards heavy action was off-putting for me. Still, you know my views on <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, so what do I know, eh? The numbers speak for themselves.</p>

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Warzone </em>has a storied history of “pay to win” weapons and skins that have dominated the meta, and YouTuber and expert JoeWo thinks he’s discovered the latest in that long line of annoyingly good guns. </p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">If you’ve purchased the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-season-4-early-patch-notes-unlimited-tac-sprint-boots-rebirth-island-ranked-resurgence-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> Battle Pass, you may have noticed the Poisoned Caress BlackCell blueprint for the AMR9. While it may not look like anything too special to begin with, this special version of the SMG comes with one very specific upgrade: The iron sights. </p> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">“It makes the iron sights absolutely broken,” the YouTuber explained. “That is the number one problem with the AMR9, [they’re] probably the worst in <em>Call of Duty</em> history if you don’t have this blueprint. They’re absolutely horrible.”</p>
 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">With the blueprint attached, however, JoeWo says the changed iron sights are “some of the cleanest we have for any SMG.” You can take a look at the video below, timestamped to 29:31, to compare. </p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="There's ANOTHER Pay to Win SMG in Warzone" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdBNymFdhPI?start=1771&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">If this sounds like your cup of tea, then JoeWo also dropped the meta loadout for the gun right now, so you can put together the best class to make the most of the newly improved sights. The blueprint can be found in Sector 11 of the Battle Pass.</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>ZEHM35 Compensated Flash Hider</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> JAK Cut Throat</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Phantom Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>50 Round Mag</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">While this definitely has a big advantage over the regular version of the gun, the good news is that it isn’t super overpowered like other “pay-to-win” items in the past. Who can forget the notorious Roze skin that blended into the shadows, or the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-gaia-operator-skin-adjustment-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaia s</a>kin which was almost impossible to see at times? Let’s pray we never see anything like that ever again. </p>

            <p>Ever since Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">unveiled The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom yesterday</a>, the community has been speculating about where this game sits in the series' timeline, discussing trailer details and, importantly, sharing fan art.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom will be the first mainline Zelda game that features the titular princess in a playable role. Rather than a sword like Link, Zelda will make her way through Hyrule with a new item known as the Tri Rod, which allows her to copy and paste items she finds in the world. She can also pick up and throw rocks at enemies, and copy enemies to do battle for her.</p>
<p>But, where does the Echoes of Wisdom fall in Zelda's expansive timeline? While there has been nothing definitive shared as yet (and, let's be honest, there likely never will be), there are some theories out there.</p>

<p>Soon after the game's trailer went live yesterday, many noted Echoes of Wisdom's map was similar to A Link to the Past's. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/eow_echoes_of_wisdom_a_link_to_the_past_maps/">post on the Zelda reddit</a> highlighted several repeating landmarks. Poster Ryon21 believed this new map could be an "expansion of the original A Link to the Past Hyrule with the addition of a new volcano northwest of Hyrule Castle and more areas to the west as well". They also noted that the "river courses and roads... are almost the same as in [A Link to the Past]".</p>
<p>User FelipeKits also pointed out the similarities between the two games' maps in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit2jm/comment/l9604ix/">separate reddit post</a>. There are also some differences between the two maps, leading one user to speculate A Link to the Past's map "will be integrated into a 'greater Hyrule' map" in Echoes of Wisdom. So, does this mean the game takes place before or after A Link to the Past?</p>
<p>One fan known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/comment/l95zkt4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">ZeldaExpert74</a> has speculated that there are three possibilities, with one being Echoes of Wisdom is the "origin to the Downfall Timeline", and takes place after Ocarina of Time (where many believe the timeline split) but before A Link to the Past.</p>
<p>They additionally suggested Echoes of Wisdom happens between Link's Awakening and A Link Between Worlds, or after A Link Between Worlds and Tri Force Heroes. "I don't think this Link is any Link we've already been. The Links from [A Link to the Past] and [A Link Between Worlds] both have yellow brims on their hats, this one has a green brim," they closed.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1dit7c1/eow_echoes_of_wisdom_a_link_to_the_past_maps/">[EoW] Echoes of Wisdom &amp; A Link to the Past Maps</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ryon21_/">u/Ryon21_</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/">zelda</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>The fandom generally seems to agree that Echoes of Wisdom takes place somewhere on the 'fallen hero' timeline, which would have happened if Link failed to defeat Ganon in Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>Another little detail worth mentioning here is that Echoes of Wisdom's announcement trailer features both the original and more recent Zora designs, showing that the game is merging old and new with this upcoming release.</p> <div>

<p>As for artwork, many are clearly delighted to finally see Zelda as the hero, and a number of creations have been shared online, ranging from the heartfelt to the more humorous.</p>
<p>For example, here is Zelda taking out an enemy with a chair like a WWF champ, as Link cheers from the sidelines.</p> <div>

            <p>
TimeSplitters has been rated in Taiwan for PS4 and PS5, leading to speculation of an imminent arrival on PS Plus.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by Gematsu, two versions of the game are listed on the Taiwanese ratings board website for both consoles. Koch Media is listed as the associated company - it's now renamed to Plaion (which joined Embracer), which acquired the TimeSplitters rights back in 2018.
</p>
<p>
However, a new game in the series was cancelled last year and studio Free Radical Design was shut down.

<p>
As such, this new listing is most likely for the original PS2 version, suggesting it could be coming to the PS Plus catalogue, though no dates are included in the listing.

<p>
The original TimeSplitters was released in 2000 with the launch of the PS2 and was followed by two sequels in 2002 and 2005. Free Radical Design comprises many of the developers from Rare's GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, so the series is considered a spiritual successor.
</p>
<p>
A new game was in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-design-closed-today-staff-say">until shut down by Embracer last year</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork taken from the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-free-radical-designs-devs-share-timesplitters-concept-art-and-more">eventually surfaced online</a> as developers were made redundant. This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/timesplitters-next-cancelled-gameplay-footage-appears-online">followed by footage</a> revealing five minutes of gameplay and Fortnite-esque elements.


</p>
<p>
A similar leak occurred in May, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-the-clone-wars-looks-to-be-joining-ps-plus-next-month">PS2 game Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a> was spotted on the PlayStation Store ahead of its inclusion in PS Plus.

            <p>When I wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> review I mentioned the true-to-life Scottish slang used by the oil rig workers of this North Sea horror. It was wonderful, but all these slang terms were being translated in the subtitles for some reason. "Gobshite" became "bastard". The "polis" were localised as the "police". And every "yersel" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became "yourself". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to "International English" for its captions. But if you want to immerse yourself in Scottish vernacular as deeply as protagonist Caz McCleary immerses himself in hazardous chemical spills, good news. There's another option, says one of the game's developers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For my American friends - [Still Wakes The Deep] detects your system locale and will default to our 'International English' subtitles," says lead designer Rob McLachlan of The Chinese Room in <a href="https://x.com/robmclac/status/1802764138441318898">a post on Xitter</a>. "If you’re not feart of a little Scots slang in your life, please switch to English (UK) for a more authentic experience!"</p>
<p>He's right. In the options menu, the default choice for subtitles simply says "English", with a secondary "English (United Kingdom)" option just under that in the drop-down menu. One of this first-person horror's great strengths is the devotion to its setting and the authenticity of its many voices. I recommend leaning fully into that with the subtitles too, for a full dose of weans, ayes, and fuds. </p>
<p>I enjoy that a studio can choose to pursue both strict realism and some messed-up John Carpenter gore-terror at the same time. You can see how the developers married themselves to authenticity by watching some of <a href="https://x.com/SWTD_Game/status/1801353388946235629">their "mini docs"</a> (essentially a collection of behind-the-scenes marketing videos). I enjoyed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuvVm2w49GA">narrative</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT0XrXtszOg">art</a> videos among these the most, in which we learn that the team had to go through the game removing every instance of a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_bulk_container">liquid-containing crate</a>, because <a href="https://youtu.be/KT0XrXtszOg?si=haNIPf_cjhNTu0po&amp;t=149">it hadn't been invented until 1992</a>. </p>
<p>In related news, our review was also <a href="https://x.com/mrsambarlow/status/1802726682492867018">called out by Sam Barlow</a> for attributing the game's "look behind you" button as historically originating in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outlast">Outlast</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> series. This feature, which lets the player peep over their shoulder as they walk around or run away from monsters, appeared before that in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-shattered-memories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>, according to Barlow, who was the designer of that game. Oops. Never mind, Shattered Memories is a blind spot of mine, and has never been ported to PC. It's principally a Nintendo Wii game, released in 2009, a year of my life which appropriately exists only as blank void. </p>

			<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay shown in yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">trailer</a> was most definitely captured on the original Nintendo Switch, new information revealed in a new technical analysis suggests.</p>
<p>Following the release of the game's first proper trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NinWRTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo World Report</a> took a look at the game's resolution and framerate, revealing that all the gameplay sequences featured in it ran at 720p resolution, effectively confirming how they were captured on the current Switch and not on its more capable successor launching next year. While the resolution is low for today's standards, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's framerate is already looking great, as the sequences shown in the trailer all ran at solid 60 frames per second, except the sequence where Samus transforms into her ball form, which led to a very short framerate drop. As the game is still months away from release, things may change in the final version, so there's no guarantee that it will indeed target 720p resolution in docked mode.</p>
<p>Besides resolution and framerate, Nintendo World Report took a good look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's other visual features, including the pre-baked lighting system which manages to look great in most situations. The gameplay sequences shown in the trailer, however, are not enough to see if the game will feature some sort of real-time ambient occlusion, as there are multiple elements that provide contradicting information.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest gameplay reveal</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is featured on Game Informer as the cover game for this month. Between the <a href="https://gameinformer.mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?m=10122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital edition</a> and the first article published <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-combat-abilities-skill-tree-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the website</a>, there's plenty of new info and statements from the developers. For this story, we'll focus on combat.</p>
<p>To start with, every swing is done in real-time, and BioWare said that special care has been put into aspects like animation swing-through and canceling. As befitting an action combat system, each class (Mage, Warrior, and Rogue) has access to light and heavy attacks. There are, however, differences in secondary attacks and defense moves. The Warrior can block, parry, and throw their shield around (if they chose the Champion specialization) Captain America-style. The Rogue can parry, too, and enjoys a wider window to perform this action; they also have access to a bow for ranged attacks. The Mage cannot parry, but they can throw up a shield that negates incoming damage for as long as they have mana. They also have access to magical ranged attacks aside from proper spells. For instance, they could put three stacks of arcane magic on a foe that is then triggered into an 'arcane bomb' with a heavy attack.</p>
<p>All classes can also switch between two weapon loadouts in the middle of combat. For example, a mage could charge their staff's heavy attack, then switch (with the controller's d-pad down button when using a gamepad) to magical daggers for a series of light attacks, and then move back to the staff for another heavy attack. Dashing and dodging are also available moves, as seen in the gameplay, and healing through potions is assigned to the d-pad's right button by default.</p>
<p>Companions can also be specialized to perform healing. Leveling up your relationship meter provides a new skill point to spend in their unique trees. Companions can unlock up to five active abilities, although only three can be equipped for combat at once.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DA_EA_AbilityWheel2_08b_RGB_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The most strategic players will be able to pause the action and order them around to unleash devasting combos through the ability wheel. However, BioWare said companions are perfectly capable of performing skills and attacks on their own, and they will get more competent over time throughout Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Interestingly, combos can be 'bookmarked' with a quick dash, allowing players to get out of trouble and resume the combo afterward.</p>
<p>The Game Informer article also provides a first look at the player character's skill trees, which are much bigger than the companions'. Here, players can unlock passive abilities that add jump attacks and/or guaranteed critical hits under certain circumstances. Of course, there are also plenty of active abilities, such as the Warrior's Spartan Kick and the Mage's Wall of Fire. Each specialization also has its own Ultimate ability. Overall, the philosophy for the skill trees in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is to allow completely different play styles rather than merely improving statistics.</p>
<p>Game Director Corinne Busche said of the combat system:</p>
<p><em>I think the first thing to keep in mind is that combat in the franchise has been an evolution. Every single entry reimagines what combat is like and I would say our goal was to make sure we had a system that allowed players to feel like they actually were able to step into the world of Thedas. They're not a player observing from afar – they are inside of this world. Being this authentic world that's brought to life, the combat system needs to support that, so you are in control of every single action, every block, every dodge, every swing of your sword.</em></p>
<p>Mark Darrah, who worked on all three previous Dragon Age installments before <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-are-leaving-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving BioWare in late 2020</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returning last year</a> as a consultant on this new game, had this to say about Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</p>
<p><em>What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap. Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is currently slated for a Fall 2024 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-roll-and-write-board-games-2024.905661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Roll and Write genre has exploded in recent years. This accessible style of games is derived from the classic board game Yahtzee. Players roll dice or flip cards, and then use the revealed numbers or symbols to mark up a private sheet. It’s a simple concept, but it’s a genre that’s ripe for exploration, and more surprisingly, sophisticated gameplay. </p><p>This type of game is highly appealing as it’s straightforward and immediately rewarding. You are afforded creativity in personalizing your own sheet or board, but the accompanying rules structure is typically straightforward. With this winning combination, Roll and Writes find a great deal of success across a wide range of players as the barriers to entry are relatively miniscule. The following group represents the best this genre has to offer.</p><h3>TL;DR: Best Roll and Write Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/6YZBZ" target="_blank">Twilight Inscription</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/KKkbn" target="_blank">Lost Cities: Roll &amp; Write</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NbpZ3" target="_blank">Super Skill Pinball: Ramp It Up</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pKREo" target="_blank">Welcome To... Your Perfect Home</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3vWXm" target="_blank">My City: Roll &amp; Build</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/E3Ywo" target="_blank">Railroad Ink</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dBnov" target="_blank">Next Station: London</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPwYR" target="_blank">Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kPNb5" target="_blank">Cartographers</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/1KPen" target="_blank">Long Shot: The Dice Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/LdGro" target="_blank">Vengeance: Roll and Fight</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/BqZwb" target="_blank">Three Sisters</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/bYeAj" target="_blank">Fleet: The Dice Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lV3pP" target="_blank">Bargain Basement Bathysphere</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ddgeb" target="_blank">Sagrada Artisans</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/BdgPb" target="_blank">Motor City</a></li></ul><h2>Twilight Inscription</h2><div id="197350"><p><h3>Twilight Inscription</h3></p></div><p>The most unique title on this list, Twilight Inscription combines the huge excess of board game giant Twilight Imperium with the Roll &amp; Write format. This sprawling experience seeks to emulate the 4X genre of video games, where players establish their space empires through exploration, exploitation, expansion, and extermination. It accomplishes this in roughly 90 minutes, which is brief in comparison to its forefather’s epic playtime of several hours. </p><p>Each aspect is represented with a separate sheet. Each of these sheets forms an entire sub-section of the game, one that can be explored and mastered over many plays. The challenge here is in focus, as each turn you must choose one sheet to perform actions upon. This creates a significant series of tradeoffs and opens up the game to many different approaches. The resulting experience is relatively large in scope, and in this way Twilight Inscription feels more akin to a full-fledged strategic board game than the typical breezy Roll and Write.</p><h2>Lost Cities: Roll &amp; Write</h2><div id="197352"><p><h3>Lost Cities: Roll &amp; Write</h3></p></div><p>Another adaptation of an existing game, this one translates the enticing card play of Lost Cities to the Roll and Write genre. Here, players are attempting to explore the jungle by heading down separate colored paths. There is a core strategic aspect where you must optimize your expedition and carefully decide which dice to select from a larger pool.</p><p>One of the more delightful qualities is the bridge bonus. The first player to make it to the seventh space on a particular color receives a boost of 20 points. This establishes a race element to the game which works hand in hand with the pulp adventure setting to provide some character and personality to play. This is a lighter experience, one that’s easily internalized, but it’s a satisfying endeavor that is absolutely worth the brief time commitment. </p><h2>Super Skill Pinball: Ramp It Up</h2><div id="166725"><p><h3>Super Skill Pinball: Ramp It Up</h3></p></div><p>Most roll and write games don’t do much in the way of conjuring up a theme, but Super Skill Pinball replicates a pinball table with nothing more than a pen and some dice. You choose one of four supplied tables to play, enter at the top, and then drop down by choosing to hit various bumpers and targets depending on your roll. It’s the same deal when it drops to the flippers but the kicker is that you can’t re-use a box twice, so your ball will eventually run out of targets and drop. It’s up to you to use the specific combo and special play rules of your table to maximize your score, making for a puzzle that’s fascinating and thrilling in equal measure. There are a number of sets available including a <a href="https://zdcs.link/YXwgx" target="_blank">Star Trek<em>-</em>themed one</a>, but Ramp It Up is the pick of the bunch and even includes a cooperative table.</p><h2>Welcome To	</h2><div id="166726"><p><h3>Welcome To... Your Perfect Home</h3></p></div><p>Welcome To isn’t strictly a roll and write game: it belongs to a closely related genre called flip and write, which replaces the dice with cards. This gives you a lot more options to work with. Here, they’re pressed into the service of town planning as you choose pairs of house numbers and building effect cards to create three suburban streets. It’s a tricky ask as you have to get houses in number order while balancing your score across various bonuses such as pools, parks and racing to be the first to meet city plans that require specific layouts. It’s super satisfying when you pull it off and there’s a surprising amount of strategy, but gamers who want even more could choose its more complex sci-fi cousin <a href="https://zdcs.link/Jnw4k" target="_blank">Welcome To The Moon</a>. </p><h2>My City: Roll &amp; Build</h2><div id="197354"><p><h3>My City: Roll &amp; Build</h3></p></div><p>Based on the popular board game My City from famed designer Reiner Knizia (<a href="https://zdcs.link/2moDM" target="_blank">see on Amazon</a>), this dice game employs a similar structure of campaign play that is wholly rewarding. Play takes place across multiple episodes, with each 30 minute session adding a small amount of new rules and wrinkles to play. This layered approach allows for a gradual increase of complexity without being overwhelming, and it succeeds admirably in this method. </p><p>Thankfully, the game is also quite flexible and allows you to play each of these episodes as a one-off session if you desire. It works well in this format, particularly once you’ve completed the campaign and are somewhat familiar with what each chapter has to offer. Either way, this is an entertaining little gem that will stand up to many plays. </p><h2>Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition</h2><div id="157142"><p><h3>Railroad Ink</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/z4m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>Rather than filling in a score sheet, Railroad Ink asks you to draw a transport network on a grid, based on tracks and junctions thrown up by its custom dice. You’re rewarded by linking as many exits as possible to the same network which rapidly becomes a tricky task as you balance the need to minimise dead ends with the desire to leave things open in the hope of linking them later. Combining risk versus reward gameplay with spatial thinking makes this roll and write quite unusual, but there are <a href="https://zdcs.link/1KrW8" target="_blank">various editions</a> to add to the variety. Deep Blue, which allows you to add rivers and lakes to your map along with potential ferry routes, is the pick of the bunch but you can go for volcanos with <a href="https://zdcs.link/XZ7Mp" target="_blank">Blazing Red</a>, forests in <a href="https://zdcs.link/LdOAP" target="_blank">Lush Green</a> or deserts in <a href="https://zdcs.link/eneXX" target="_blank">Shining Yellow</a>. 	</p><h2>Next Station: London</h2><div id="166727"><p><h3>Next Station: London</h3></p></div><p>Another train-based game but this time a flip and write, Next Station: London offers the novel twist of making pencil colors a key part of the game. Each color ties into a starting station on the player’s map, which is where you begin to draw your network based on the station symbol of the drawn card. You can extend in either direction and even branch your line as you try to cross as many districts as possible, taking in tourist sites, joining other lines and crossing the river on the way. But beware as you can’t cross lines except as stations, meaning that a sprawling, high-scoring first turn may box in your expansion for later lines. Then all the players swap pencils and start anew. It’s a simple concept that reveals surprising nuance over repeat plays, giving it an edge of additive puzzling while resulting in fun multicoloured maps.</p><h2>Dinosaur Island: Rawr N Write</h2><div id="158416"><p><h3>Dinosaur Island: Rawr ‘n Write</h3></p></div><p>Part of the appeal of roll and write games is their speed and simplicity, but Rawr N Write was the first of a new breed in the genre that uses the concept as a springboard to more complexity and depth. The dice roll gives players a choice of resources such as money and DNA that they need to build their own Jurassic World style dinosaur theme park. You’ll need to sketch out your park with both attractions and concessions stands on a mini-grid, while also bringing in staff, special buildings and taking care of security. Then, at the end of each of the three turns, you run an actual tour route through your facility to score points while hoping no-one gets eaten. With so many different aspects to juggle, planning your park is a rich, brain-burning challenge while running the tour brings the numbers to life with a thematic kick. Read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dinosaur-island-rawr-n-write-board-game-review">Dinosaur Island: Rawr 'n Write review</a> for more details.</p><h2>Cartographers</h2><div id="158417"><p><h3>Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://bonsai.to/p57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>Games in this genre often play well with large groups because there’s a central roll or flip and everyone tries to make the best use of the results. That means a lack of player interaction, which Cartographers came along to challenge. This is a flip and write where the idea is to use the cards to map out the terrain of a fantasy kingdom, trying to fulfil some variable scoring challenges. The fun twist is that every so often there’s a monster card, at which point you pass your map to your neighbour and they have to figure out the most annoying place to draw the negative monster icons in your kingdom. Not only does this make Cartographers feel much more personal, but the maps you’re left with at the end have an engaging sense of world-building about them, conjuring up some theme. The sequel, <a href="https://zdcs.link/yZKEr" target="_blank">Cartographers: Heroes</a>, added more dynamic monsters and new hero cards to ride in and save your kingdom from their depredations.</p><h2>Long Shot: The Dice Game</h2><div id="166738"><p><h3>Long Shot: The Dice Game</h3></p></div><p>Horse racing game Long Shot was fine, but this derivation into a roll and write has proved a smash hit with players. Unusually for the genre, there’s an actual board for the track around which the horses race, based on a dice roll, but some horses are more likely to move than others. Your job is to watch the unfolding race and bet sensibly on the odds as proceedings come to a head. However, you can also use your cash to buy horses to access a special power and a hefty bonus if it wins, as well as take various options to fiddle the odds in favour of your chosen steeds. Since everyone is free to bet on any horse, this creates a fascinating web of dependencies between players as the race progresses, since horses you’ve backed may pay out better for your opponents. With interaction, excitement and a hefty dose of theme, Long Shot: The Dice Game satisfies in areas other roll and writes cannot.</p><h2>Vengeance: Roll and Fight	</h2><div id="166739"><p><h3>Vengeance: Roll at Fight</h3></p></div><p>Most games in this genre fit a certain, relatively staid, pattern of having a random seed to offer all the players a choice, which they mark on their sheet. In trying to recreate the hectic pace of a martial arts movie, Vengeance: Roll and Fight turns these expectations upside down. This is a frantic real-time game where players generate actions for their turn by trying to grab dice and roll combos faster than the other players. Once the pool of dice is empty you can use your actions to draw a route through a warehouse full of goons, moving, fighting and looting your way to a showdown with the boss. With variable characters, each with a unique roster of abilities and items, plus lots of maps to work through, the fast play time and variety mean you can keep rolling and fighting over and over into the small hours.</p><h2>Three Sisters</h2><div id="158814"><p><h3>Three Sisters</h3></p></div><p>It’s common for roll and write games to reward players who achieve particular combination of rolls or scores, but Three Sisters takes this concept to the extreme. Your score sheet here is a garden in which you grow a variety of crops and flowers and purchase various tools based on the results of dice rolls making a rondel of actions available. However, when you complete certain actions the reward is often a bonus action which you can then, in turn, use to gain another bonus action and so on. Indeed, the action chaining gets so intense that the score sheet has a special space to record and rub out your bonuses as you accrue and use them during a turn. Making full use of these chains requires more strategic planning than most games in this genre offer, making this a tactical treat. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/three-sisters-board-game-review">Three Sisters board game review</a> for more info.</p><h2>Fleet: The Dice Game</h2><div id="166740"><p><h3>Fleet: The Dice Game</h3></p></div><p>This is another combo-tastic game which tries to snare players more with a plethora of interconnected options. As the owner of a fishing fleet, you’ll need to decide whether to use the dice to buy licences for the depicted type of seafood or to launch a boat to catch it. The further you go down each tree, the bigger the rewards. Boats will later return to the harbor where you can sell your catch and construct buildings that offer additional benefits over the 10 rounds of play. It’s all about using the dice as random seeds and working out the best set of interconnected benefits you can glean from each tree of potential options. Fast, fun and with a thematic set of mock mother of peal dice, Fleet: The Dice Game is a lot less dangerous and a lot less smelly than real high-seas fishing.</p><h2>Bargain Basement Bathysphere</h2><div id="202218"><p><h3>Bargain Basement Bathysphere</h3></p></div><p>While roll and write games can often accommodate large numbers of players, they’re also fast and fun to play solo. So the logical next design step for the genre is a solo-only game: enter the delightfully named Bargain Basement Bathysphere, originally conceived as a fan project to print and play, but which proved popular enough to get picked up by a major publisher. Over the course of a multi-challenge campaign, you’ll pilot your makeshift craft into the deep and back, trying to use your dice pool to hit the spaces you need to achieve your goals before you run out of oxygen or structural integrity. Things start simple but build rapidly into a real challenge with lots of long-term mini-games to balance and jokes to enjoy.</p><h2>Sagrada Artisans</h2><div id="202217"><p><h3>Sagrada Artisans</h3></p></div><p>The original Sagrada was quite a chill game of arranging gem dice to mimic stained-glass windows. This version takes it a step further in multiple ways. From a roll-and-write perspective, you now get to actually colour in your window as you build, and to maintain that sense of calm there’s even additional decorative colouring in to complete for fun while you wait for slower players to finish their turns. The other fresh aspect is that it’s now a campaign game in which you complete your beautiful windows over a series of ten sessions, each adding fresh tools and challenges to the mix without compromising the game’s simplicity or Zen-like feel, making for a smooth ride up to an exciting finish.</p><h2>Motor City</h2><div id="202216"><p><h3>Motor City</h3></p></div><p>Coming from the same designers responsible for two previous entries on this list, Three Sisters and Fleet, this is the culmination of their roll-and-write experience. It turns the genre into a mirror for car production lines, where you’re controlling four different aspects of vehicle design, engineering, testing, production and sales. So you’ll need to use its dice-drafting mechanic, supported by the novel blueprint board that offers potential bonuses alongside the dice itself, to try and coordinate the actions you need to take your muscle car all the way to market. Eschewing the explosive combos that typified their previous games and aiming instead for a more joined-up strategic challenge, this is the most innovative offering of the three.</p><p>For more ideas, be sure to check out our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games of all time</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">best puzzle tables</a> featuring <a href="https://zdcs.link/0e0RA" target="_blank">a great multi-purpose table (by Bits and Pieces)</a> for playing cards and board games on, too.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

        <p>This month's showcases had plenty of treats for established audiences, but showed little potential for overall growth</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I really enjoyed the spring/summer games showcases we've just watched.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">the PlayStation one</a>, which was notably lacking in big names, had something to offer. In the past Sony would have done some 'jazz hands' and stuck on a trailer for a game that is early in development (or, harking back to the days of the Final Fantasy VII Remake reveal, isn't in development yet). And maybe it should have done that. Instead, it showcased a handful of games that are due out in the next few months. And one of those games, dear reader, was Astro Bot, which I suspect will be a game of the year contender. It may not have been the most exciting of showcases, but at least all of it was coming soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-new-gears-of-war-and-doom-headline-xbox-showcase-2024">Xbox's showcase</a> proved to be the headline act, and it had a bit of everything. There were games coming out soon, games for 2025, games for further out. There was real gameplay, there was some jazz hands, there was Fable. It was a superb show front-to-back. And what's more, Microsoft made a very public commitment to Game Pass, silencing those who were suggesting – including myself – that the company might scale back its subscription efforts. Now it just needs to deliver on all that promise.</p>
<p>Nintendo was the surprise package. With the Switch in its twilight years, expectations were muted for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/metroid-prime-4-and-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-headline-nintendo-direct">the firm's June Direct</a>, so the reveal of new Mario, Zelda and Metroid games sent the fanbase ablaze (and Nintendo didn't even need to show more of that Pokémon Legends game that was announced back in February). Many of those games are out imminently, and although Nintendo's main development teams are probably beavering away on the next console, it's clear that the current Switch isn't about to just fade away.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved the big titles on display. I've got at least ten AAA games on my wishlist that weren't there in May. And there were some fantastic looking games on show. I've rewatched that Doom trailer a bunch of times. And a new Zelda where you actually play as Zelda? Wonderful. Where do I sign up?</p>
<p>Yet as a business journalist, I remain deeply concerned by the situation the games industry finds itself in, particularly the AAA console business. And when it comes to the big companies, I saw very little to reassure me.</p>
<blockquote><p>If before these events you were asking what the games industry has up its sleeve to progress the artform, attract new fans and take the business to greater heights, I suspect you are still asking those questions</p></blockquote>
<p>The brutal layoffs that have blighted the industry over the past 18 months is continuing. We hurtled into this announcement period following heavy redundancies at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-laying-off-5-of-staff">Take-Two</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">Microsoft</a>, and then immediately ran into more at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sumo-group-to-reduce-staff-by-up-to-15">Sumo Digital</a> on the other side. Analysts expect another year of this to come, and everywhere is feeling it. Looking at the numbers across the industry, the current financial quarter is going to make for depressing results.</p>
<p>The industry is desperately seeking growth, and something new to drive some excitement in the market. And on that side of things, I am not sure I saw anything in recent weeks that is going to deliver that.</p>
<p>PlayStation's State of Play offered little beyond 2024. Xbox's showcase was jam-packed with games, but so many of them were thematically similar. There were shooters, there were Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style fantasy adventures. It opened with the crimson-stained, brutal horror shooter Doom and ended with the crimson-stained brutal horror shooter Gears of War. There was some interesting things such as South of Midnight and Mixtape, but overall it was an event for the fans.</p>
<p>Nintendo's event was the same. It was a bunch of remasters, another Mario Party, another Zelda game (18 months since the last one), and the third Mario RPG in a year. I loved all of it, but I didn't see many things that are speaking to people who aren't me.</p>
<p>If before these events you were asking what the games industry has up its sleeve to progress the artform, attract new fans and take the business to greater heights, I suspect you are still asking those questions.</p>
<p>Of course, it's wrong of me to expect that from games alone. This wasn't a hardware 'E3', and it's usually new consoles that deliver that kind of excitement. There's a growing impatience around things like Switch 2 and Xbox's rumoured handheld, certainly from me.</p>
<p>And as for the games, well there was an important message that opened Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest event. In that opening, he reminded us that some of the biggest games of 2024 (so far) have not been major franchise titles from established AAA teams. It's been games like Palworld, Helldivers 2 and Balatro. The suggestion, quite rightly, is that the biggest games of (not) E3 probably won't turn out to be Doom, or Metroid, or Astro Bot, but rather something completely unexpected. Perhaps it'll be that game where you play as a bean, or the one with the deer, or the one where the adventurer is running a tea shop. There were over 700 games showcased over the past four weeks, and one of them is bound to surprise us.</p>
<p>During this time of the year, I often look to the big companies to see where the industry is headed. I look to them to tell me what will take our medium to the next level, both as a business and as an artform. Instead, what I got was a lot of AAA companies playing to the gallery. Perhaps that's okay. At a time when our industry is struggling, there's logic to playing it safe. And it's arguably wrong of me to expect 'not' E3 to provide all the answers.</p>
<p>Yet I still feel this industry is ripe for disruption. Not just in terms of business models and platforms, but also in terms of experiences. And based on the last few weeks, it seems like that disruption will most likely come from those outside of the biggest publishers.</p>

            <p>Revealed at yesterday's Nintendo Direct stream - but absolutely coming to PC because there's a Steam page for it - The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy seems like a mash-up of visual novel and Fire Emblem-y RPG battles on grids. And it's by the folks behind Danganronpa and Zero Escape, which means there will be lots of consequences and decisions that lead to copious amounts of despair, no matter how you finish the game apparently. If there's one thing that really gets me going, it's a game devoid of happiness and cheer.</p>

<p>In keeping with many Japanese teen stories you're a totally 'average' guy, Takumi Sumino, who lives in Tokyo. Then out of the blue, lots of horrible monsters start attacking the city and a ghostly tic tac with a bow tie says, "Here, have the power to fight these creatures with the power of anime, but stick to the grids on the floor. Stab yourself in the chest! Oh and go to school". School being the Last Defense Academy out in the middle of nowhere, where Takumi and others will learn how to defend it for 100 days straight.</p>
<p>There's the promise of spending time with your pals to "deepen bonds" or to craft them gifts so you can deepen them even further. I'd imagine this confers benefits in battle, where turn-based fights have you line up abilities on a grid against waves of demons. Demons ranging from cute little orbs to levitating dragons that, going by the trailer, you can bash with a motorbike. I hope it's like Persona in the sense that you'll deepen bonds with the motorbike person and they'll develop greater motorbike affinity, maybe by like, expanding their motorbike with a sidecar for extra area-of-effect damage.</p>
<p>Details are pretty thin on the ground at the moment, but I'm here for a JRPG where your pals likely fit into four main categories: deranged, tsundere, guy who pushes up his glasses and smirks, as well as outgoing loudmouth who is positively unbearable but also your strongest pal so you can't swap them out of your party.</p>
<p>The game comes out sometimes in early 2025, and you can follow it over on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/">Steam page</a>. I've also been meaning to play a single Danganronpa or Zero Escape game for some time now, but I've never got round to it. They seem cool, if a bit intimidating because there are so many of them and they probably all take around 90-hours to complete.</p>

            <p>Japanese role-playing game enthusiasts are eating good this week, as Square Enix announce a 3D remake for 1993's Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge Of The Seven. It's a high fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you must shore up an empire and defend it from generation to generation against a group of legendary adventurers, who were trapped in another dimension many moons ago and are positively livid that people don't talk about their sacrifices enough. It's out 24th October 2024, and springs from the turbulent brains of the team behind 2020's Trials of Mana remake, which was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924980/Trials_of_Mana/">well-received</a>. I've got a trailer's worth of rabble-rousing orchestral music and sparkly tag-team finishers below.</p><!--more-->

<p>Revenge Of The Seven (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2455640/Romancing_SaGa_2_Revenge_of_the_Seven/">Steam page here</a>) casts you as several emperors in succession, all plucked from a pool of characters representing over 30 classes. Each ruler also inherits the knowledge and abilities of their predecessor via some funky sorcery. The campaign's "unique story structure" is a balance of expanding your Empire and sticking it to the Seven Heroes, with "dramatically" different outcomes based on who you fight first, who you ally with, and so on. There's a strategy game element in the shape of "a devoted Royal Court overseeing the economy, technology, city construction, and magic". It sounds pretty involving.</p>
<p>The original's turn-based battle system returns with a "Glimmer" mechanic that lets you harvest abilities in the fray, and a formation system that bestows benefits based on positioning, but they've added a timeline system and new combination attacks. Square Enix and their collaborators xeen Inc. have also bodged together some new difficulty settings, with Hard roughly resembling the original's "brutal" challenge while Casual is for people who favour story over battle, and Normal is for "veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game".</p>
<p>The old 2D pixel sprites have been remodelled in 3D, based on Tomomi Kobayashi's original illustrations. Towns and dungeons are also now fully rendered with different layouts. As for the audio component, there's full Japanese and English voice acting and they've brought back original Romancing SaGa 2 composer Kenji Ito to overhaul the score - you can switch between new and original soundtracks in-game.</p>
<p>All this forms part of Square Enix's on-going dire scheme of essentially swapping the past for the future by remaking or, at least, remastering every bloody thing in their back catalogue. That's not nostalgia you're feeling, it's anticipation! The flagship production there is obviously Final Fantasy 7, which is now two remakes in. Square have also just announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-is-headed-to-pc-in-november">they're bringing a "HD-2D" remake of Dragon Quest III to PC this November</a>, and continue to make less costly "new games in the old style", such as Octopath Traveller. They've ruled out remaking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-you-wait-over-20-years-for-a-final-fantasy-6-remake-because-thats-how-long-it-might-take">FF6</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-a-final-fantasy-8-remake-after-ff7-remake-director-suggests-its-simply-too-much-work">FF8</a> as too much work, at least.</p>
<p>There's probably scope for a Square Enix role-playing game plotline about ancient Squaresoft or Enix RPGs returning from another dimension to vengefully smother brand new Square Enix RPGs at birth. That said, the original Revenge Of The Seven never officially released outside Japan, so this is effectively a new game for my money. I'm moderately keen.</p>

			<p>Animator Lee Davis has rejoined Naughty Dog after fulfilling positions at Microsoft's The Initiative and&nbsp;PlayStation-backed studio Deviation Games.</p>
<p>The Naughty Dog veteran announced his return to the studio yesterday on LinkedIn. "I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Senior Animator at Naughty Dog", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208597491619962880/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he wrote</a>. Joining Naughty Dog in 2010 to work on The Last of Us, The Last of Us Part II, and Uncharted 4 as well as spin-off The Lost Legacy, David left the studio in 2020 to join <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-coming-along-pretty-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark studio The Initiative</a>. Following a 1.5-year stint at the Xbox-owned studio, Davis joined PlayStation-backed studio Deviation Games in March 2022. As most of you will know - this <a href="https://wccftech.com/deviation-games-shuts-down-was-originally-working-on-a-live-service-ip-for-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio was recently shut down</a>, and was working on a new live-service IP for PlayStation.</p>
<p><em>"It is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Deviation Games", </em>the studio's former HR Chief and Operations Officer Kriste Stull wrote back in March of this year.<em> "I want to express my deepest gratitude to our entire team. Thank you for all your hard work, dedication, and contributions to Deviation; I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have worked with each and every one of you."</em></p>
<p>As said David has now rejoined his old studio, but this time as a Senior Animator. No additional details about which project the veteran will be working on have been shared, but it might very well be the studio's new project that Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann<a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> talked</a> about recently.</p>
<p>Druckmann said, <em>"So, I'm not only excited for this game that we're making -- and it's, it's something really fresh for us -- but I'm also excited to see how the world reacts to it. Because of The Last of Us, and the success of the show, people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next. I'm very excited to see what the reaction for this thing will be — and I've already said too much about it. I'll stop there."</em></p>

            <p>
News on the 20th anniversary edition of Beyond Good &amp; Evil has been teased for a showcase tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LimitedRunGames">Limited Run Games Showcase</a> will be shown on 20th June at 7pm, with "more news" about the game expected.
</p>
<p>
This news comes courtesy of the official Beyond Good &amp; Evil account, including some comic art from artist Hubert Chevillard featuring everyone's favourite pig uncle Pey'j.

<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">Ubisoft confirmed the remaster would be released in "early 2024"</a> - technically 21 years after the original, despite the 20th anniversary moniker.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Looks like Uncle Pey'j has a message to share with you all...<br>See you at the Limited Run Games Showcase on June 20th at 2pm EST for more news about Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition! 👉 : <a href="https://t.co/zaLKVRlN2A">https://t.co/zaLKVRlN2A</a> Big thanks to Hubert Chevillard for this little teaser😀 <a href="https://t.co/dY2PqL2JWn">pic.twitter.com/dY2PqL2JWn</a></p>— Beyond Good and Evil 2 (@bgegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/bgegame/status/1803095350950949107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Some fans were accidentally able to play this last year due to a technical error, so it's unclear why it's taken so long to hear more news.
</p>
<p>
Nothing on the franchise was shown at the recent Ubisoft Forward livestream, when at least something on this anniversary edition was expected.
</p>
<p>
At least we know news is coming, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 seemingly remains vapourware</a>. It's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">game with the longest-ever development period</a>, with the 2017 E3 trailer the last time we got a proper look at it.

</p>
<p>Still, the official account mentioned above has the name Beyond Good and Evil 2, so perhaps there's still hope?</p>

<p data-characters="444" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The prospect of getting to appear in your favourite video game series, even if it’s only a bit part, is undeniably an exciting one. So, I wouldn’t blame anyone for wanting to take part in Ubisoft’s new competition, where the prize is voicing a character in the upcoming <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Said competition, however, has been met with criticism and accusations of Ubisoft trying to get free labour out of its fans.</p> <p data-characters="781" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">On June 18, Ubisoft announced the <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> Dubbing Challenge. Until July 2, TikTok users are encouraged to record themselves dubbing a cutscene from the series. The best performer in each of the seven available languages will then get to join a recording session for a behind-the-scenes look at voice acting, and record their own lines for an NPC who will be added to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Full details can be found on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/5JEWsSKwGmJDmlvvM12PpN/voice-an-npc-in-assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft’s website</a>, where the publisher stresses that the voices of the lead characters and every other NPC have been recorded by professional actors: “With the Dubbing Challenge, we aim to provide a fun activation that will allow winners to learn more about the captivating work of voice actors &amp; actresses.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="879" data-injectable="true">While this is undoubtedly a cool and fun opportunity for fans, others want to know if Ubisoft has any intention of actually paying the winners for their voicework. After all, voice acting is a profession; one many do for a living. <a href="https://x.com/CerberusXt/status/1803315409933762911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One Twitter user</a> told Ubisoft, “You are a multimillion dollars corporation, and even if paying for the trip to your studio is nice, you could pay people for their actual recording session too.” <a href="https://x.com/BrokenOptics/status/1803341726049878387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Another</a> outright called the competition “exploitation”, saying, “Don’t work for free, they can afford voice actors.”</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Some professional voice actors have also weighed in on the matter, such as <a href="https://x.com/JackSapsford/status/1803119281036738711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">British actor Jack Sapsford</a> who called voice acting “a job, not a competition.” <a href="https://x.com/rufusgwright/status/1803186900271763584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rufus Wright</a>, who did voice work for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-assassins-creed-valhalla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</a></em>, has also taken umbrage with the competition, saying, “Using fans to work for free is a really really bad look, particularly when these games gross billions of dollars.”</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true"><em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> actress <a href="https://x.com/akaGhostBird/status/1803334410777026819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jennifer Caitlin Roberts</a>, meanwhile, wants Ubisoft to confirm it won’t be using the fan submissions for training AI. There have been concerns in recent years of companies using AI voicework in place of professional actors, with many actors fearful of their voices being replicated and used without their consent. This contributed to members of the SAG-AFTRA union <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/video-game-strike-approved-by-sag-aftra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approving a video game strike</a> last September.</p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">The replies under the announcement of the competition <a href="https://x.com/AccessTheAnimus/status/1803106835227894015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a> are also full of condemnation, and pleas for fans not to participate unless they do get paid for their performances. There are a handful of people, though, who are interested in taking part so they can appear in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. One voice actor, <a href="https://x.com/IsaacBirchallvo/status/1803154531535978962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Isaac Birchall</a>, called it “a brilliant opportunity for a young VA” considering the studio experience and coaching that will be involved.</p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="false">This isn’t the first time Ubisoft has come under fire for outsourcing work from its fans. Back in 2018, it <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/beyond-good-and-evil-2/hit-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invited people to submit their own artwork and </a><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/beyond-good-and-evil-2/hit-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">m</a><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/beyond-good-and-evil-2/hit-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">usic</a> for use in <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/both-the-beyond-good-evil-sequel-and-remaster-were-a-no-show-at-ubisoft-forward-and-fans-are-distraught/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which remains MIA to this day</a>). But while it did offer payment, it would only be for artists whose work would end up in the game. So, people were expected to risk spending time on crafting the kind of quality work you’d see in a big-budget video game with no guarantee they’d be paid for it.</p>

        <p>CEO now owns 31% of the firm, which spun out of his own esports outfit Faze Clan</p>

  <div>



            <p>Richard 'Faze Banks' Bengtson has acquired a 25.5% stake in content creator-focused entertainment company Faze Media.</p>
<p>Bengtson, also its CEO, now owns 31% of the firm. Previous majority owner GameSquare will still have a controlling interest in the company, to ensure its "stability and continued growth," the announcement said.</p>
<p>Bengtson initially was behind esports outfit Faze Clan, which he co-founded back in 2010. The <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesquare-acquires-faze-clan">company was acquired by GameSquare in October 2023 for $18.5 million</a>, a year after going public with a $725 million valuation. The company had laid off 20% of its staff in February 2023.</p>
<p>The firm remained independent as a wholly owned subsidiary of GameSquare, with Bengtson as its CEO. It <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesquare-launches-faze-media">launched Faze Media last month</a>, with Bengtson overseeing the new operation. At the time, the brand was 51% owned by GameSquare, and 49% by president and co-founder of DraftKings Matt Kalish, who invested $11 million.</p>
<p>Bengtson commented: "We've always believed in the immense potential of Faze Clan, and now, with the reins back in our hands, we're more committed than ever to taking it to new heights. This isn't just a business move – it's about reigniting the original spark and driving forward with the same passion and creativity that built Faze into a global phenomenon."</p>
<p>He added: "We’re so confident in Faze Clan’s potential that we are putting our own money on the line and will continue to build with the support of GameSquare and Kalish who share our vision for the future."</p>
<p>GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna said that the announcement was a "win-win", adding: "Since completing the acquisition of Faze Clan in March 2024 our strategy has been focused on reigniting the Faze brand by returning its founders in a meaningful way. With the support of Matt Kalish and his direct investment in Faze Media, we structured the new business as a creator-led IP and media company.</p>
<p>"Today's announcement solidifies this approach by empowering Faze Media's creators with a significant stake in the business and aligning Faze's founders in the success of the brand."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-producer-reveals-surprising-inspirations-and-its-not-persona-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail studio HoYoverse’s newest upcoming title, Zenless Zone Zero, is a fusion of what you’d expect from HoYoverse games with totally new ideas. The game studio's development processes are largely a mystery, but in an interview with Zenless Zone Zero producer Zhenyu Li at a media event, IGN learned a little more about what goes into kicking off an entirely new game at HoYoverse, Zenless Zone Zero’s future, and at least this particular team’s position on generative AI. </p><p>Zenless Zone Zero (also known as ZZZ) is an action game with a heavy emphasis on its flashy urban landscape set in an apocalyptic world. Players take their team of three into monster-infested roguelike zones, then bounce back to the city landscape to complete side quests, get to know characters better, and maybe grab a cup of coffee or bowl of ramen. </p><p>Like the other HoYoverse games, its variety of stylish characters with combat specializations is arguably its biggest focal point. As the entertainment landscape <a href="https://www.ign.com/special/ai-week"><u>has been in a tumult</u></a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/how-ai-could-change-video-games-forever"><u>with the rush in the development of generative AI</u></a>, we couldn't help but ask: is the Zenless Zone Zero team using generative AI in development, or is it planning to?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think that the human touch is more meaningful right now and this is what our team is pursuing.</p></div><p>"Today, no," Li said. "For the art part, we have not tried it, but we have tried a part of it to touch on the programming. As for the art aspect, I think that the human touch is more meaningful right now and this is what our team is pursuing."</p><p>This approach seems to be in line with what the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-honkai-star-rail-is-using-ai-technology-to-supplement-development"><u> Honkai: Star Rail team explored in using AI for development as of last year.</u></a> </p><p>Li also explained that when developing ZZZ's characters, the aesthetics came first early on. However, that changed as development progressed. The planning team responsible for character mechanics and the art team now work closely together to create new characters. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zzz-1718737408431.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Zenless Zone Zero releases on July 4. </figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>The Zenless Zone Zero Team and Collaboration</strong></h2><p>The development team behind HoYoverse’s massive games has largely been a mystery, though Li offered some context on how the ZZZ team behind that handmade art came to be. Li said it began with only 12 people in its initial demo stages in 2020 before growing to around 60 people during its first closed beta. Now, it's ballooned to more than 400 team members.</p><p>"Zenless Zone Zero’s development team is very young and a lot of us come from different backgrounds," Li said. "We have veterans from the gaming industry but also young talents who share the same values and are all passionate about getting involved in the creation of an interesting product. Indeed, some team members including myself had experiences working on HoYoverse's other projects before. Take me for instance: I used to take care of the CG, animation, and video for Honkai Impact 3rd."</p><p>Li clarified that the ZZZ team only works on their project rather than swapping between other HoYoverse properties and that collaboration between the different game teams is "quite rare." </p><p>"Not that it doesn't exist," Li said. "I'll check with the teams for an advisor such as [for] the technical aspects."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Zenless Zone Zero Inspirations</strong></h2><p>Li acknowledged that the ZZZ team received many comparisons to Persona 5 with both sharing a stylish city setting, though he said they're hoping to create something unique. And though there may be some visual and musical similarities, the heart of the game doesn't have its roots in Persona. </p><p>Aside from the urban setting, one element that reminds Persona players like myself of Atlus' series is ZZZ's time system. Similar to Persona 5, ZZZ has four points in the day with different activities available as time passes with mission completion and other triggers. Li explained his inspiration for ZZZ's time mechanic was actually instead from a much older game important to his childhood: Digimon World. The 1999 game also features a clock with specific events that happen at particular times throughout the day.</p><p>The other major inspiration was, surprisingly, Street Fighter 6. Though ZZZ is an action game more akin to DMC and not a fighting game, you can see the inspirations in its fast combat, emphasis on stunning enemies, and chaining combos. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Zenless Zone Zero’s development team is very young and a lot of us come from different backgrounds.</p></div><p>Li mentioned he's spent thousands of hours in the Street Fighter series and learned a lot about the feedback of its action with "how [each] punch really feels that it’s on the flesh of only your own flesh." Li said the ZZZ team is trying to draw inspiration from their own combat and make each animation frame matter. </p><p>Another major lesson Li took from Street Fighter 6 was how to pace tutorials for newcomers to action games. Pacing of all ZZZ's mechanics has changed quite a lot between each of its closed betas, and Li said the planning team has tried to make sure all important tutorials are more spread out to not be overwhelming. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/zenless-1718737700300.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Zenless Zone Zero is the latest from Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail studio HoYoverse.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Potential Future of Zenless Zone Zero</strong></h2><p>When ZZZ launches on July 4, it'll be available on PlayStation 5, mobile devices, and PC, but Li said they're not stopping development there. They're working to bring ZZZ to Nintendo Switch and Xbox too, though Li framed ZZZ's arrival on these platforms as a hope and not something quite set in stone.</p><p>As a live service game, though, it is set in stone that ZZZ will get content updates. Li confirmed this will include things like expansions to the city with new neighborhoods, shops, and of course, characters. </p><p>"We have a basic framework for the story timeline, but we're also a very flexible team," Li said when asked about how far they've planned ZZZ's story. "We constantly review what we've created in the past to see if we can continue to utilize it or if we have better ideas and solutions."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"When designing these characters, we would always consider what players haven't seen before.</p></div><p>One international HoYoverse fan request has been for better representation in characters, especially in the HoYoverse games that feature real-life inspirations of diverse cultures yet neglect to reflect the people who live there. Steps to reflect these international audiences have been taken to varying degrees, and ZZZ's amalgamation city provides fresh opportunity to do more. </p><p>"In Zenless Zone Zero, we have created a wide range of characters. When designing these characters, we would always consider what players haven't seen before. We want to ensure characters of various types are included, so players can look forward to more imaginative designs that will surprise them in the future."</p><p>"I think our team has added almost everything we wanted for the launch and the game is ready for players," Li said. "However, of course, we have plenty of interesting ideas and plans for the game in the future which we will share more at the right time. One thing that I particularly want to share is that the multiplayer battle mode is already under development. I hope players can look forward to this mode in future version updates."</p><p><em>Miranda Sanchez is the Executive Editor of Guides at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181423/plo-koon-acolyte-dave-filoni<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2jx9D7">Lucasfilm’s new Star Wars series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star_wars_the_acolyte/s01/reviews">earned praise</a> for simply existing outside of the Skywalker Saga — after 47 years of stories set in the same stretch of timeline, a jump back <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what">“100 years before the rise of the Empire”</a> to the shinier High Republic era is enough for aching Star Wars fans. But even with a prohibitively old setting and a cast of characters divorced from Anakin and Luke, <em>The Acolyte</em> creator Leslye Headland is still finding ways to pepper the drama with Easter eggs. Episode 4 gave those in the know a whopper: Plo Koon.</p>
<p id="qetf4D">Plo Koon, the Kel Dor Jedi known for his chic oxygen mask, first appeared in scenes of the Jedi council in <em>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</em> and grew into a fan favorite when he took on an action role in <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>. Plo’s biggest fan might be <em>The Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni, who has made his passion for the B-tier Jedi extremely clear to the Star Wars fandom over the last 20 years, having cosplayed at conventions as the Jedi, snapped photos with fellow cosplayers, and showed off his Plo Koon toy collection on social media. His “personal life” section <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dave_Filoni">on Wookieepedia</a> is entirely facts about his Plo Koon collectibles. Despite him being one or two levels removed from a Glup Shitto, Dave Filoni is all in on Plo Koon.</p>

<p id="8qw4sh">I believe Filoni when he says he has talked extensively about Plo Koon with George Lucas. Reportedly, when the animator was pushing to beef up Plo’s part in the <em>The Clone Wars</em>, there were plans to cast an actor who sounded like Toshiro Mifune in <em>Seven Samurai</em> to give the Jedi a samurai feel. But Lucas thought the character was goofier than that and wanted a Jim Carrey type. Filoni landed on actor James Arnold Taylor because of his Gandalf vibes. The Lucas-versus-Filoni Plo-off doesn’t end there; at Star Wars Celebration 2023, Filoni admitted that he made the case to his boss that Plo Koon, due to #skillz, obviously would have survived Order 66. Lucas shot down the canon alteration request, but Filoni stands by his defense.</p>
<div id="mtojoo"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/602zh2NzQ5o" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Ln2jAJ">None of this was relevant to <em>The Acolyte</em>… until now. For a split second, standing in a drop shop with Osha on their way to meet the Wookiee Jedi Kelnacca, is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-him appearance by Plo Koon, who has not actually appeared in live action since <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. How could Plo be alive during the High Republic era? That’s very human of you to ask, but just like Yoda, he is technically old enough to be around kicking; nerd number-crunching based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/fbgf3y/plo_koons_age_in_legends/">decanonized Legends materials</a> puts him around 382 years old during the time of <em>The Clone Wars</em>, which should make him already a seasoned veteran of the Jedi in <em>The Acolyte</em>. </p>
<p id="lWQ5MV">For a hot second, it sounded like Filoni may have snuck his guy into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-mandalorian"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>. Leaks hinted at a potential reveal in the season 2 finale, but as it turned out, early storyboards and VFX footage were all <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22641121/mandalorian-luke-skywalker-cameo-leaks-plo-koon">an elaborate scheme</a> to hide the return of a de-aged Luke Skywalker. “All it takes is one person treating the film in color correction, one person who goes on social media and says, ‘Guess what I saw today?’” Mark Hamill said in the <em>Disney Gallery</em> making-of doc centered on the episode. What no one seemed to care about at the time was how mad Filoni’s fellow Plo Koonheads must have felt! </p>
<p id="wGQwtb">Technically, <em>The Acolyte</em> is one of the few Star Wars projects that Dave Filoni does not seem directly involved with; he doesn’t share any writing or directing credits on the series, nor does he hold a general producer credit. (By all accounts, his attention is fully on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23896100/star-wars-ahsoka-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Ahsoka </em>season 2</a>.) And maybe it’s THE Plo Koon. In theory this unnamed Jedi is just another Force-sensitive Kel Dor.</p>
<p id="nGG63o">But c’mon, it’s Plo Koon. And it makes sense why Headland would want the cameo. As the showrunner has said, she purposefully set up her writers room to represent <a href="https://www.avclub.com/leslye-headland-s-favorite-star-wars-is-the-star-wars-y-1847118044">a broad spectrum of Star Wars fandoms</a> and surrounded herself with people who could bring their own Easter egg wishlists to the table. So while longtime fans may have prayed at the altar of George Lucas, others involved were weaned on <em>The Clone Wars</em> — and Filoni’s pro-Plo brand of fandom. So it’s no surprise that <em>The Acolyte</em> would find ways to nod to the OT, the prequels, and even the cartoons that have little in common with its world: If you are on the right side of Star Wars history, you make room for Plo Koon.</p>
<p id="K5l2HS"><em><strong>Correction: </strong></em><em>A previous version of this story stated that Plo Koon last appeared in live-action in The Phantom Menace, but his final live-action appearance was in Revenge of the Sith. We’ve edited the article to reflect this. </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177908/star-wars-acolyte-tv-they-them-pronouns-stop-being-weird-about-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="BpP9lL">In the fourth episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171372/star-wars-high-republic-acolyte-when-timeline-what"><em>The Acolyte</em></a>, Osha (Amandla Stenberg) meets some new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult">Jedi</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading">Jedi-affiliated</a> friends. One of them is a small, otterlike creature named Bazil. Bazil and Pip, Osha’s fussy robot companion, keep sniffing and beeping at each other, interrupting the mission briefing Osha is trying to follow. After, Osha approaches Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) for an awkward exchange all too familiar to queer people watching television in the last few years: </p>
<blockquote>
<p id="Edd5i1">Osha: Who is that?</p>
<p id="VBiblj">Jecki Lon: That’s Bazil.</p>
<p id="YK8ZQT">Osha: Is he [<em>dramatic pause</em>]… <em>or they</em>… with us?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="MUCiuF">This is the latest example of what I’m going to call <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/the-other-two-disney-character-globby-has-a-real-gay-twin.html">the Globby problem</a>, expertly parodied on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23727452/other-two-lance-josh-segarra-hot-yes"><em>The Other Two</em></a>: well-meaning writers and showrunners — some of them queer themselves — trying to awkwardly insert nonbinary or genderqueer representation into their show, usually through the show’s requisite “weirdo” character. The result is, instead, often pretty othering.</p>
<p id="uwsaCZ">In <em>The Acolyte</em>, Osha only asks about Bazil’s pronouns, not those of any of the other people she meets. This reveals more about Osha than I think <em>The Acolyte</em>’s<em> </em>writers were intending; the exchange implies she is actively othering Bazil and assuming he (yes, it is later revealed Bazil uses he/him pronouns, which makes all of this even sillier) must be gender-variant because he looks odd to her.</p>
<p id="ogwBoz">I get that the effort is to remind the viewer that not everyone subscribes to a binary of gender expression, and Osha is trying to be open-minded about that. To be clear, I’m not asking for every character to ask every other character about their pronouns when they first meet. That would be extremely boring television! It’s very easy to establish characters’ pronouns by having other characters use those pronouns when speaking about them. This happens all the time. (“This is Bazil, they’ll be helping us on the ground” is the easiest thing in the world to put into a conversation, in a world where Bazil uses they/them pronouns.) But <em>The Acolyte</em> going out of its way to make a show of only asking about the character who looks the most different is quite weird (and unfortunately makes Osha kind of look like a dick). The end result is that no one is happy — toxic Star Wars fans are mad for the usual bigoted reasons, and I’m mad because it’s so thoughtless.</p>
<p id="i2tA2W">Because it’s not just <em>The Acolyte</em>!<em> </em>Even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168842/star-trek-discovery-finale-interview-showrunner-end"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>, a show that largely had thoughtful and committed queer representation and characters, stumbled with this during its recently aired final season. As Captain Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) approaches an alien planet, she turns to a crewmate and marvels, full of awe, at how the planet has three genders. Except Captain Burnham’s ship, the Discovery, <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-trans-non-binary-blu-del-barrio-ian-alexander-1234824183/">has (at least) three genders represented on board</a>!!! Within that context, that makes Captain Burnham sound like a captain who, at the very best, forgot she has a nonbinary crew member on board, and at worst doesn’t respect that crew member’s gender identity. There is not a chance that was the intended effect of the <em>Discovery </em>writers room, but that’s the only way to read that line within the context of the show.</p>
<p id="faU9RP">These examples clearly seem to be the result of showrunners and writers who mean well and want to be inclusive, but stumble along the way. It ends up othering nonbinary and genderqueer people even more when you consider which characters get placed in that position, and when other characters ask about pronouns. At the end of the day, while broader representation of more genders is good, making a show of asking for pronouns in your television show is not necessarily a net positive. When characters are only doing so to characters who are markedly, visibly different — even straight-up animals, in Bazil’s case — it’s weird! It doesn’t feel like an honest attempt at accurately reflecting gender and its many different variations and contexts, but instead like they’re thinking of representation as a checklist that can be achieved through language alone.</p>
<p id="eAwIeA">In the case of <em>The Acolyte</em>, it feels like at best an empty gesture and empty pandering toward queer fans, and at worst Disney weaponizing the most toxic fans in the Star Wars fan base to drive conversation by making sure they’re predictably mad about nothing. Personally, I don’t fully buy that latter theory, but I think it is notable that if Disney wanted to design empty gestures that got toxic fans mad without actually being transgressive in any meaningful way, it would look exactly like this scene in <em>The Acolyte.</em></p>
<p id="ATNYgT">On the positive side of things, the recent <em>Doctor Who </em>episode “Rogue” is a good example of how to do this naturally. While talking about a former love, Rogue (Jonathan Groff) just says “I lost them” without it being some big performative gesture that he would deign to use an “unconventional” singular pronoun. And hey — maybe the person he was talking about doesn’t use they/them pronouns, and Rogue just didn’t want to be too specific. The important thing is, he said it like a person, not like he just won a GLAAD award for allyship. More shows that want to dip into broader gender representation should give that a shot. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exoborne-first-preview-extraction-from-the-eye-of-the-storm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Today’s forecast: chaos and violence.</h2></div><section><p>With the blurb “Gear up, get in, and get out”, Exoborne elegantly sets out its stall as an extraction shooter. But they left out the most important part: “Get blown around by a massive tornado”. While Exoborne bears all the features you’d expect from the likes of Escape from Tarkov and Call of Duty: Warzone’s DMZ, the most exciting part of a presentation I saw at Play Days was when developer Sharkmob talked about the weather.</p><p>Exoborne’s setting is not postapocalyptic, but rather midapocalyptic, with the world falling apart all around you – the result of mankind’s meddling with the climate. Project Rebirth’s attempts to provide limitless clean energy have backfired somewhat, and now Mother Nature is taking her revenge. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Exoborne Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>Extraction shooters live or die on emergent gameplay, and there’s nothing as emergent as a twister, flood or tsunami. The weather during a session of Exoborne can change from clement to hellscape in minutes – all of which has profound effects on gameplay, according to Sharkmob. </p><p>A 10-minute walkthrough video based on a pre-Alpha build of the game began with a short cutscene where a group of teammates known as The Reborn assemble in a dropship and prepare to jump. The character models are based on whatever skins and loadouts each player has selected, so this is a nice chance to show off your flair before the action starts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The players then skydived from the dropship, parachuting in to the map below. Action kicked off immediately, as this area of Colton County in the Southeast USA was infested with killer robotic machines and human enemies. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Over a longer play session, you can expect a dynamic range of climates to impede your progress. The rain apparently gets so heavy you can no longer hear your teammates, their comms drowned out by the deluge, forcing players to rethink their strategies.</p></div><p>Kill, loot, equip – so far, so extraction shooter. Entering a base located nearby required some teamwork, and the destruction of some AT-ST-like enemy walkers, while at another point the squad clambered aboard a Warthog-style armored vehicle with open top/sides/back for ease of blasting. Maps are as vertical as they are wide, with towers connected by huge Rebirth Cables that snake through the environment, placed by the architects at Rebirth without regard for the scenery or the human residents; these industrial eyesores allow players to ascend with grappling hooks and fight on higher ground. Burned-out school buses and a busted motel sign litter the deserted streets of what might long ago have been an idyllic rural town. Sinkholes offer the chance to explore underground.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Exoborne Images</h3></div></output><p>And then came the tornado warning. Once the weather hit, the squad cut their mission short, calling in the dropship and climbing aboard with the loot before things got hairy. But a Sharkmob developer explained that over a longer play session, you can expect a dynamic range of climates to impede your progress. The rain apparently gets so heavy you can no longer hear your teammates, their comms drowned out by the deluge, forcing players to rethink their strategies.</p><p>While the risk may be high in any given session, Sharkmob has designed Exoborne to be more forgiving in the longer term. That is, extraction is not always guaranteed, and you may lose items in a given session if you don’t make it out alive – but the game makes it possible to rebuild your arsenal over future games, improving your character from game to game as you loot and progress. The idea is to make the game as approachable as possible for newcomers, who may find the high risk of other extraction shooters off-putting.</p><p>Throw in a bunch of cool near-future weapons, tech gear and Exo-Rigs, and of course a mix of PVP and PVE scavenging action, and Exoborne is shaping up to be a cool addition to the genre.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-story-demo-serves-up-sick-tricks-and-cool-vibes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Skateboarding has always been cool. Somehow, Skate Story adds something new.</h2></div><section><p>Skate Story’s vibe gripped me right away. Its liminal, Vaporwave-inspired levels mix hyper-realistic concrete textures, lighting effects, and objects like a chain-link fence or The Moon with engrossingly impressionistic flourishes like The Skater’s body, which is made of kaleidoscopic glass, or the on-looking, ever-judgemental eyes whose disembodied voices screech in unison in disdain for your quest. It’s a lot to take in, but never too overwhelming. These levels felt just wild enough to imbue each moment with its own distinct sense of cool without distracting me from the mission at hand: skating.</p><p>Skating might be the most normal thing about Skate Story. That’s not to say it’s bad or uninteresting, but it does feel exactly how you’d want a skating game to feel. It has a great sense of speed as you accelerate by holding down or mashing the A button to go as quickly as humanly possible. This game’s tight camera really emphasized that sense of speed too, focusing on your crystalline avatar as they lean into any momentum they can get a hold of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Skate Story Slideshow - Tribeca Festival</h3></div></output><p>I saw a pretty early section of the game, so tricks and jumps—while fun—were pretty simple. Holding down a specific button controls one of The Skater’s feet, and hitting another button initiates the trick itself. Each trick and jump works on a timer, with a little notch sliding around the outline of an organic shape. Releasing the button for a trick or jump while the notch is floating around in the thicker part of said outline will execute it perfectly, and reward you with better air time. Doing a trick with imperfect timing didn’t seem to cause that much of an issue, but I’m certain it will become increasingly important later on in Skate Story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It shot up to the top of my Steam wishlist after my hands-on demo at Summer Game Fest this year.</p></div><p>The levels I played had me zooming down tight corridors, exploring a courtyard, jumping over deadly neon red nettles, and visiting museum gift shops at the behest of verbose statues. Although that speed demonic camera worked wonders for Skate Story’s feel, it sometimes betrayed its flexibility of movement and occasionally even fought against its own sense of speed and pace as it obscured certain objectives or obstacles in some levels. Obstacles are usually easy enough to vault over, even with a split-second’s notice. But The Skater is made out of glass, so even the slightest error can set you back a spell, making the camera problem a tad more frustrating than it would be otherwise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unreliable camera aside, each level presented a satisfyingly diverse approach to design and pacing with repetition cleverly punctuating important moments while twisting what I’d already seen into something new and fresh thanks to its unexpectedly charming writing. Developer Sam Eng told me that this semi-autobiographical story is inspired by true events, but didn’t go much deeper than that. The chunk I saw was so strange and impressionistic that I can’t wait to see where Sam takes the story next. In my half hour with the demo, I watched as The Skater set out on their quest to shatter the moon. Culminating in a trial to prove their worth—and their skating chops—Skate Story’s writing and sense of humor stand in a league of their own. This isn’t just because its metaphorical approach is weird, but because it had me chuckling all the way through.</p><p>With a promising story, absorbing vibe, and responsive skating controls, Skate Story has so much potential as both a distinct story and a damn cool skating game. It shot up to the top of my Steam wishlist after my hands-on demo at Summer Game Fest this year, and I can’t wait to see the weird places this wildly expressive skating game goes.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/critter-cafe-cute-critters-and-a-cozy-cafe-await-you<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Cute creatures and open-ended customization options seem like the perfect game for any cozy gamer, especially ones who aren’t looking for very challenging puzzles.</h2></div><section><p>Critter Cafe embodies coziness. From its rescue cafe premise to its no-holds-barred approach to customization and decoration that encourages players to express themselves, the brief demo I watched and played pointed to a consistent, refined vision that I have a feeling will be a big hit for fans of monster collecting games who are looking for something cozy to sink their teeth into.</p><p>Blending monster collecting, management simulation, and puzzle-based dungeon crawling sounds a lot more overwhelming than it actually is in Critter Cafe. That’s not to say that this comfy game from Sumo Digital and Secret Mode is oversimplified, just that it’s chill and approachable. Like any sim worth its salt, customization is the name of the game here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With in-depth customization options (that can be changed at any time) for my chibi avatar and full-on cafe customization, the world is your aesthetic oyster in Critter Cafe. I was blown away at how much I could do to precisely mold the cafe to my liking. From wallpaper and floorboards to furniture—even the materials it was made from—I felt a sense of control and freedom over the cafe in a way that can often elude some games in this genre.</p><p>To give you a proper sense of what I mean, let’s look at Animal Crossing: New Horizons, for example. It’s a stellar game to be sure, but one whose customization suite leaves a lot to be desired. Changing your island or house takes a lot of work. Beyond the steps to actually unlock the recipe for something, you’ll often need tons of resources to craft said piece, which can be gated based on the real-life passage of time. But even without the progressive aspect of unlocking new recipes, clothes, etc. the process of customizing a home gets really tedious really quickly.</p><p>Not so in Critter Cafe, where customization options are available to you from the get-go. This allows for other mechanics and parts of the game to shine while still letting you express yourself to the fullest without jumping through extra hoops. Redecorating isn’t just for fun, though. Instead, you’ll often need to change the cafe at a customer’s request for special events. Indeed, these events are one of the ways you can grow and improve your cafe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Critter Cafe Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Let’s say a customer wants to have a movie night. You can redecorate with movie theater-themed furniture to cater to your customer’s desires. They might also share other aesthetic preferences and even tell you what kind of critter they’d like to spend time with. If you hit a high enough mark for a customer, they might even tell you where to find a portal that will take you to a new critter to befriend.</p><p>These adorable little beasties are mostly amalgamations of real-life and mythical animals with some kind of endearing twist or change. My favorite looks like a kit-bash between a dinosaur and a duck. But making a new feathered friend isn’t as simple as walking through a portal. Instead, you’ll need to complete a small block-pushing puzzle to find your new buddy at the end of a cave.</p><p>Normal service is a little bit more complex than the special events, and will help you and your critter deepen your bond as your reputation grows. Growing your reputation is the other main way that you’ll progress in Critter Cafe, so it’s important to balance leveling up your reputation while also making sure to make new friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These adorable little beasties are mostly amalgamations of real-life and mythical animals with some kind of endearing twist or change.</p></div><p>My one gripe with what I saw of Critter Cafe was how simple those puzzles seemed. Yes, this is a cozy game first and foremost, so they’re probably not going to be Portal-level brain busters, but they seemed potentially lacking in diversity. That said, the puzzles I saw weren’t bad. In fact, they seemed like the perfect level of challenge to give me something to do in between running a cafe and hosting special events, but these same puzzles didn’t seem to promise much in the way of verticality or evolution based on what I’ve played and seen in trailers and screenshots.</p><p>If in fact they don’t grow or change much, they could seriously undermine the wholesome creature-befriending scenes at the end of each puzzle. Part of what made this demo special was how exciting it was to meet a new critter. If that gets pulverized into something tedious or repetitive, that could very easily dampen Critter Cafe’s otherwise exuberant nature.</p><p>I’m really interested in seeing what kinds of whimsical combinations Sumo Digital has in store for the rest of Critter Cafe. I hope the next time I hear about it brings more stuff to do while befriending critters and tells me a little bit more about its story, which seemed pretty light in the demo. But even if there’s no overarching plot to speak of, I’m certain its deep customization suite and critter designs will almost definitely appease the most rabid cozy gamers looking for their next obsession.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-metroid-and-mario-prove-the-switch-is-far-from-dead<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I was told there was supposed to be a software drought while we waited for Switch 2. I was told to expect a handful of ports, remakes, and remasters sprinkled throughout the rest of 2024. I was told the Switch was dying.</p><p>Well, apparently no one told Nintendo. And if they did, Nintendo certainly wasn’t listening, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>today’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> was one of my favorites in years, with surprise announcements that will make the wait for Nintendo’s next console incredibly easy. Don’t unplug the dock from your entertainment center just yet, because the Switch still has plenty of juice left.</p><p>If you were completely removed from the video game news cycle and you watched the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, you’d probably think it was a presentation dropped somewhere during the peak of the console’s life cycle. Nintendo really brought out the big guns with new entries in its classic trio of franchises: Mario, Zelda, and Metroid. We got our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-revealed">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, a brand new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">mainline The Legend of Zelda game starring the eponymous princess</a> for the first time, and the long-awaited <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-opens-with-mario-luigi-brothership">return of the Mario &amp; Luigi series</a>, continuing the fairytale-like resurgence of Mario RPGs over the last year. Add on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-revealed-nintendo-direct-2024">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-announced-for-switch-at-june-2024-nintendo-direct">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and Nintendo revealed four brand-new first-party games and one remaster, three of which will be out later this year.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Logan's Favorite Nintendo Direct Games (June 2024)</h3><p>My top ten favorite announcements from the Nintendo Direct on June 18, 2024. The top two will surprise no one!</p></div><p>I really appreciate Nintendo’s focus on concrete release dates in its Directs. The Xbox showcase this year was <em>awesome, </em>but we were left with a lot of “TBA” or generic “2025” dates. I’m super excited for games like Fable and Perfect Dark, and can’t wait to eventually get them, but it’s a lot easier to be more excited about a new Zelda game I didn’t know existed when I woke up this morning that will be in my hands exactly 100 days from now. </p><p>And The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom really looks like my dream game. Everything we know so far points to Nintendo taking the explorative, creative spirit of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and injecting it into the top-down Zelda formula. In today’s reveal trailer we see Zelda building a column of water and ascending to its surface, stacking beds to create a makeshift ladder, and running across treetops 2D Zelda has forever used as barriers for the player. Plus, this is a Zelda game without a sword, and it’s allowing the developers to truly go crazy with combat and puzzle possibilities. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Echoes of Wisdom looks like my dream game.</p><p>BotW/TotK's spirit in a top-down game.</p><p>Convention breaking! Zelda runs along treetops 2D Zelda has forever used as barriers.</p><p>I've wanted a Zelda game without a sword for years because I thought they'd go crazy with it... and they did! <a href="https://t.co/tElILFVtmn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/tElILFVtmn</a></p></div>— Logan Plant (@LoganJPlant) <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganJPlant/status/1803140765981483264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Moving on from Zelda to Mario, the remakes of Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door already felt like small miracles, and it’s truly shocking that Nintendo is completing the trio by putting out a brand new Mario &amp; Luigi game this November. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is the first Mario &amp; Luigi game in nearly a decade, and it marks the franchise’s home console debut. After Mario &amp; Luigi developer AlphaDream sadly went bankrupt in 2019, it seemed like the series was dead, so it was a huge surprise to see this game kick off the Direct. We still don’t know who is developing Brothership (Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-really-didnt-want-us-to-know-who-developed-the-super-mario-rpg-remake"><u>frustratingly quiet about this</u></a>), but hopefully Nintendo brought on some of AlphaDream’s talent to continue the series.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn’t coming until sometime in 2025, but how great was it to finally see what it looks like now, over seven years since its original announcement? It certainly appears to be a faithful Metroid Prime game, complete with the iconic HUD, raindrop effects on Samus’ arm cannon, and the return of the detective-like scanning ability. As a huge Mario Party fan, I also loved seeing a brand new entry that seems to learn from the strides the series took in 2021’s Mario Party Superstars, with bigger boards, more minigames, and tons of characters to choose from. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first-party surprises were the stars of the show, but I have to give a shoutout to some of the great third-party games developers are still bringing to Switch. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-is-as-faithful-as-you-could-ask">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake looks gorgeous</a>, and it was a phenomenal surprise to learn that Dragon Quest I and II are getting the same treatment. And, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-revealed-remasters-two-spin-offs-nintendo-direct-2024">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a> is finally bringing the last unlocalized Ace Attorney game to the West, which I never dreamed would happen as a lifelong Ace Attorney fan.</p><p>My one main disappointment from this Direct is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Don’t get me wrong – I love Donkey Kong Country Returns, but I’ve already played it twice on both Wii and 3DS. Plus it’s easily the inferior Donkey Kong Country game compared to Tropical Freeze, which is already on Switch. I’m glad Nintendo hasn’t forgotten about Donkey Kong, but I’m still waiting for the first brand new Donkey Kong platformer since Tropical Freeze hit Wii U in 2014. </p><p>Still, that’s a minor quibble for a Direct that otherwise blew my expectations out of the water. And as someone who can’t stand leaker culture, I loved that none of Nintendo’s major first-party announcements got out beforehand. It gave the whole event a level of energy and mystery that was missing from some of the summer’s other big showcases, like when Sony’s big Astro Bot reveal was spoiled online days before the State of Play. Astro Bot looks incredible and I can’t wait to play it, but it takes some wind out of the sails of a big, exciting showcase when we know exactly what to expect.</p><p>The Switch has already established its reputation as one of the greatest Nintendo consoles of all time, and if the major first-party games revealed today turn out to be as good as they look, it will strengthen the argument that no other Nintendo software library can match Switch. Pulling out some of the most iconic franchises in gaming during the Switch’s eighth year on the market is quite the power move, and it puts an emphatic stamp on the most successful generation in Nintendo history. If the Switch is dying, this is one hell of a farewell tour.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Nintendo Direct June 2024 Games</h3><p>Every game featured in the Nintendo Direct on June 18, 2024.</p></div><p><em>Logan Plant is IGN's Database Manager, Playlist Editor, occasional news writer, and frequent Super Ninfriendo on Nintendo Voice Chat.

Lenovo's proprietary Legion Space software serves as a console-like hub for your games from each launcher.</p><p>Similar to the Nintendo Switch, it has detachable controllers and a kickstand for tabletop mode. Each of the detachable controllers has a pair of back buttons and there's also a mouse scroll wheel. The right controller has a trackpad, too.</p><p>The Legion Go's battery life isn't great, as it only lasts upwards of a few hours on a full charge. Granted, handheld Windows PCs tend to lose their charge quickly in general. Though not ideal, the Legion Go does have a rapid charging feature that allows you to refuel to 70% in around 30 minutes.</p><p>It has a pair of USB-C 4.0 ports, a microSD card slot to expand your storage, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>Overall, the Legion Go is a well-rounded device--and if you're looking for a handheld with Windows that offers broader access to PC games than Steam Deck, it's certainly worth a look--especially if you really want a larger screen.</p></div>                      </div><p>It's worth mentioning that <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028407127445674%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flenovo-legion-go-pc-handheld-drops-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6520492%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy has a nice deal on the Asus ROG Ally</a></strong>, which is essentially an affordable, smaller alternative to the Lenovo Legion Go.

<p>In Evotinction, a virus known as Red has compromised an AI system, causing it to become rogue. This AI oversees a research and development facility named HERE, which now poses a threat to all who enter. Dr. Liu, the Head of R&amp;D at HERE, opts to infiltrate the facility to discover the cause of the malfunction and, if possible, deactivate the rogue AI. Lacking combat skills, Dr. Liu must rely on hacking and stealth to navigate through the facility’s levels and address the core issue. The gadgets he has access to allow him to carry out l<span>ong range signal disruption, radio &amp; electromagnetic jamming, make hologram illusions, implant malware, and takeover systems. </span>Evotinction <span>features over ten hours of fully-voiced story content, along with a variety of environments to sneak and hack through.</span></p>

            <p>
Following the sudden cancellation of Paradox Interactive's ambitious Sims-like Life by You, the company has confirmed it's closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic.
</p>
<p>
Paradox Tectonic - the 24-person team overseen by former Sims boss and CEO of Second Life studio Linden Labs, Rod Humble - was unveiled with some fanfare back in 2019. It wasn't last March, however, that its first game, Life By You, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">officially revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the time, it seemed like a solid proposition, promising Sims-like gameplay and ambitious features including an "open game world where everything is customisable" and "real language conversation". Unfortunately, the project quickly ran into trouble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">missing its original September 2023 early access launch</a> before getting hit with a succession of further delays.

<p>
And then, after announcing an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-delays-sims-like-life-by-you-again-but-wont-commit-to-a-new-release-date">indefinite delay</a> for Life By You back in March, Paradox finally pulled the plug earlier this week, calling the project, a "clear failure... to meet both our own and the community's expectations." And with the project dead, the studio behind it has, perhaps inevitably, followed suit.
</p>
<p>
News of Paradox Tectonic's closure was shared in a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-close-down-paradox-tectonic">statement from Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester</a> on the company's website. "This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who've worked hard on Life by You's Early Access release," Wester wrote. "Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre."
</p>
<p>
Paradox's decision does, unfortunately, mean another round of job losses in what's been already devastating year for the games industry. Since the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 workers</a> have already lost their jobs across companies including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studio-deviation-games-has-closed-down">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-is-reportedly-set-to-close-roll7-and-intercept-and-sell-off-private-division">Take-Two</a> - that's more layoffs than the industry faced throughout the whole of an already grim 2023.
</p>
<p>
As for Paradox, Life By You's cancellation is just the latest in a string of high-profile disasters for the publisher - including the troubled development of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of 2023's The Lamplighters' League (resulting in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">split with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>), and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">catastrophically premature</a> launch of Cities: Skylines 2 last October. Fan confidence in Paradox's upcoming - and repeatedly delayed - Prison Architect 2 has also taken a hit following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">part ways with long-running series developer Double Eleven</a> ahead of its release, suggesting its troubles might not yet be over.
