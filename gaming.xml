			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is still scheduled for release this Fall, the game's publisher Take-Two Interactive recently confirmed.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250206999431/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reports-Results-for-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Rockstar Games' parent company stated that this calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for Take-Two, thanks to the release of games such as Mafia: The Old Country in the Summer, Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall and Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>Besides reiterating that Grand Theft Auto VI is still releasing this Fall, in its latest financial reports, Take-Two Interactive also confirmed the number of copies sold for some of its franchises and games. The Grand Theft Auto series as a whole sold over 440 million units, and almost half of these sales are thanks to Grand Theft Auto V, which has sold, to date, a whopping 210 million units. The Red Dead Redemption series, on the other hand, has sold over 95 million units, and the vast majority of these sales are thanks to Red Dead Redemption 2, which sold over 70 million units worldwide and has been the second best-selling title in the United States based on both unit and dollar sales. The NBA 2K franchise also continues to do quite well, having sold over 155 million units worldwide and being one of the top contributors to Take-Two's recurrent consumer spending.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future, Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick also confirmed, as reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/take-two-talks-nintendo-switch-2-indicates-it-will-support-the-console/">Nintendo Everything</a>, that the publisher fully expects to support the Nintendo Switch 2. Take-Two has had a longstanding relationship with Nintendo and has supported the platform when it made sense. Nowadays, Nintendo's consoles can support any audience, according to Zelnick, suggesting that the publisher could support the next console with more diverse titles not strictly aimed at a younger audience.</p>
<p>While a delay is always possible, it is definitely good to hear that Grand Theft Auto VI will launch as scheduled in a few months on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A lot seems to be riding on its successful release, as it is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, </a>so no matter when it is launching, it will almost certainly be a smashing success.</p>

We have some negative outliers as well, including a 40 from Eurogamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We think that as people play the game longer, the sentiment improves because with every launch of a new Civ, the team pushes the envelope a little bit and our legacy Civ audience is a little bit nervous about what they initially see and then they realize, wow, this is actually really incredible, and they dive in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we feel really, really good about it. We know we have a couple of issues. We have a bit of an issue with the UI, for example. We'll address that. So I wouldn't say the early access release is perfect in every way.

Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves. The Civilization games have never had such a system. Clearly, Zelnick believes Civ fans will come to love it over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Firaxis has work to do turning sentiment around, particularly on Steam. A game’s Steam user review rating is crucial for its success on Valve’s platform.

Take-Two has said it "fully expects" to support <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, and indicated that no game was off the table for Nintendo's next console.
</p>
<p>
Speaking last night during Take-Two's latest financial results call, as heard by Eurogamer, company boss Strauss Zelnick was questioned about the extent to which Switch 2 would see games from the Borderlands, Mafia and GTA publisher.
</p>
<p>
And while Zelnick stopped short of confirming any particular title for Switch 2, he did take time to note that Take-Two's thinking around Nintendo's audience had changed.

<p>
"We've had obviously a long-standing relationship with Nintendo," Zelnick began, "and we've supported the platform when it made sense for the individual release. 
</p>
<p>
"There was a time when Nintendo platforms are really geared at younger audiences and that was reflected in our release schedule. And now today with Switch and potentially with Switch 2, the Switch device can support any audience. 
</p>
<p>
"As you may have noted, Civilization 7 is now on Switch. So while we have nothing specific to report, we actually would fully expect to support Switch [2]."
</p>
<p>
Does Switch 2 have the technical prowess to run <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>? That's another matter. Alternatively, you could see Take-Two eyeing up the Switch audience as yet another avenue from which to boost the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">already enormous sales of GTA 5 and GTA Online</a>.
</p>
<p>As for Rockstar's next game in the series, last night we heard confirmation that the hugely-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">GTA 6 is still on track - for now - to launch in the autumn of 2025</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/what-we-played-citizen-sleeper-2-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve had an exciting week of playing things I’m not allowed to tell you about yet, but what I can tell you about is the awesome time I’ve been having. 2025 feels like it’s going to be a good year for game fans, and there’s lots of exciting stuff on the way in both Early Access and the wider world.</p>
<p>I’ve covered my bedside table in handhelds in the last week, hopping into Citizen Sleeper 2 on ROG Ally, Puzzle and Dragons Z on the 3DS, Soul Calibur on the Retroid Pocket 2, and the Riki 8-Bit Collection on Nintendo Switch. There is barely room for my books and a brew, stacking them up in an unwieldly and potentially dangerous way. So far, there hasn’t been disaster. So far…</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 this week, buoyed by the new update (which temporarily broke things) and working away on our review of Robobeat. Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> is still in Japan so has had no gaming at all. Keeping us up to date on his trip, he told us, “I have visited Kanazawa, Hiroshima, and currently in Kyoto. Unfortunately this time next week my holiday will be over.” Sorry that the real world beckons, Aran!</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been working on a very special project these last few months, and him and Jim are starting to lift the lid on it! He tells us, “Jim and I gear up to crowd fund the Playing with History book, I’ve been playing a bunch of games with a historical or mythological setting to gather ideas for articles. One of those is Immortals: Rise of Fenyx. I’d bounced off the game on its release but I’ve been thoroughly enjoying playing it in 2025! A pitch perfect interpretation of the Ancient Greek gods, hugely entertaining combat, satisfying puzzles to solve, actually funny; it all adds up to a great open world game!”</p>


<p>When he’s not been working with Ade, <strong>Jim</strong> has continued to creep around in the weird world of Alan Wake II. He says, “I’ve just hit the point of no return and while I’m keen to see how the rest of the story plays out (and wrap up any DLC) it’s been a bit of a mixed bag, overall. The combat gameplay is still weak and cool elements such as the Mind Palace and Case Board aren’t used to their full potential. There are also times where the game feels a little too self indulgent with looping/meandering sections that remind me of the worst parts of Control. At the same time, I’m glad we have games like Alan Wake II.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has occasionally been angry with his games this week, but not much of that was directed at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. He tells us, “I’ve also tried High on Life, which is exactly what you expect except the shooting is surprisingly competent, and I’m slogging through the shocking embarrassment that is Dragon Age The Veilguard. No wonder Mike Laidlaw left the dev, must’ve been like watching a CEO drown his child.” You may, perhaps, be able to tell where his anger has come from.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> also played some Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, doing the legwork for our review video. Once that had been wrapped up, he made a start on Avowed, where he’s going to do the same trick for our review of that. He also checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/spider-man-2-pc-review/">Spider-Man 2 on PC</a>, finding things to be generally solid if you’re shooting for PS5-like quality.</p>
<p>How about you, what have you played?</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled.1102941/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Put your red and white scarf back on the coat rack, football friends. The match has been called off. The entire season, in fact. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 25</a> has been cancelled because it has not met a high enough standard in time for its intended release next month, according to developers Sports Interactive. Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be given a refund, they say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25 and shift our focus to the next release," said the developers in <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">a statement</a>. "Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be... we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</p>
<p>"We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year."</p>
<p>This other game is a reference to the next instalment, Football Manager 26. The devs are now just working on that one instead.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive have previously hyped up the now-binned sideline shouter, pitching it as a fresh start for the series. It would be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-will-be-for-the-first-time-in-decades-a-true-sequel-say-sports-interactive">"for the first time in decades, a true sequel"</a> with a new graphics engine, revamped UI, women's football, better animations, the works. It announced a short delay to its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-managers-biggest-technical-and-visual-advancement-for-a-generation-arrives-november-but-sports-interactive-are-keen-to-lower-expectations">release date</a> in November 2024. But just one week after that it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-has-been-delayed-until-march-2025-to-avoid-compromising-our-usual-standards">delayed again until March 2025</a>. </p><p>Now, it's not happening at all, and that fresh start will have to kick off next football season. It's a surprisingly late cancellation, and a somewhat last minute announcement. Sports Interactive couldn't tell fans the bad news until now, they say, because lawyers said so. </p>
<p>"Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement," they said.</p>
<p>As for getting your money back, if you pre-ordered you'll get automatically refunded in full through whatever platform you bought it on, so long as it's an "official SEGA-approved retailer." That <a href="https://privacy.sega.com/en/sega-europe-approved-partner-list">list</a> includes Steam, Epic, Humble and a bunch of other places. It's only bad news if you bought your tickets to this big game from a CD Keys tout. Either way, take off your red and white bobble hat and come back inside for a cuppa. No, I don't know what team you support. It's the red and white one. They're all red and white, aren't they? That's the colour of football.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tokyo-xtreme-racer-early-access-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokyo Xtreme Racer is a PlayStation 2 game. Now, years of YouTube comments from cynical types who were likely still jostling around inside an ovary at the dawn of the millennium <em>may</em> have taught you that ‘PS2’ is a pejorative – a one-size-fits-all put-down wielded against anything that doesn’t melt the multiprocessors off a graphics card. But it doesn't have to be. The PS2 was an incredible console, brimming with great, approachable games that achieved exactly what they set out to do, were hopelessly addictive, and completely unburdened by microtransactions and live-service malarkey. This succinctly describes Genki’s 2025 Tokyo Xtreme Racer reboot, which recently arrived in early access on Steam: a fantastically moreish blast from the past that’s simple on the surface, steeped in high-speed thrills, and (for now, at least) unapologetically single-player. <em>That’s</em> what makes it a game in the grand style of the PS2 and, for that, I already love it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h19m38s859-1738916412780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Even the music matches the originals.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, I’m aware that the overall lineage of this series dates back to 1994’s Shutokou Battle on SNES, and the Tokyo Xtreme Racer name itself can be traced back to the series Dreamcast debut (and sequel) in the US. However, in PAL territories those carried different titles, and that’s why I’m waxing romantic about the PS2: because 2001’s Tokyo Xtreme Racer on Sony’s all-conquering console was my first exposure to the series, and I admire how closely Genki has stuck to its enduring format well over two decades later.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I admire how closely Genki has stuck to its enduring format.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who haven’t had the pleasure, the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series focuses strictly on highway street racing, taking a heavy dose of inspiration from the real-life underground racing scene that peaked on Tokyo’s expressways back in the ’90s. (This was made infamous by the likes of the highly secretive Mid Night Club – an allegedly disbanded racing community still shrouded in mystery today thanks to anonymity amongst its members and its strict, low-profile policies).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After choosing an on-ramp to enter the freeway system (which faithfully recreates Tokyo’s actual Shuto Expressway network) the aim is to cruise and hunt down rival racers to challenge. Races are triggered on the fly by flashing your headlights behind potential rivals, and won unconventionally. There are no finish lines here; instead, their “Spirit Point” bar will drain to empty as they drop further and further behind you, collide with members of the public, or graze the walls. It’s part racing game, part fighting game, and it still works as well as it ever did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wisely, Genki hasn’t tampered with any of this, and it remains the structure of Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s early access revival in 2025. The graphics have received a handsome enough modern makeover but otherwise it’s a staunchly old-school experience. The result is terrific, and I’m hooked once more.</p><div id="rank-japans-most-iconic-car-marques-in-order-of-coolness" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Japan's most iconic car marques in order of coolness</h3><h3>Rank Japan's most iconic car marques in order of coolness</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Duelling against one opponent at a time and slicing through late-night freeway traffic in a single direction may sound limited and repetitive. In a way, I guess it is. And yet it’s utterly absorbing. Even in early access, Tokyo Xtreme Racer features over 200 named opponents to seek, stalk, and destroy. Some are boss characters that will only emerge after you encounter the rest of their race team members and leave them for dust. Some can only be found and raced under certain circumstances or if you perform specific tasks, the clues for which you can glean from conversations with rivals in parking areas. The writing in these conversations tends to be a bit overwrought (and the story itself leans a little too melodramatic for my tastes) but there <em>is </em>a goofy charm to it I can stomach. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h07m17s149-1738915704979.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">As can this bloke, I suspect.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The difference in difficulty between some of these opponents can be stark at times, so I will say that my experience has been a little uneven. One moment I’ll be beating every buster I find, and the next some mystery hot shot is simply galloping away. Races that are very evenly matched and decided by tactical slipstreaming (or goading your opponent into an obstacle) are the most fun, but they’re a little too uncommon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has the potential to create the occasional logjam in your progression, because a lot of the upgrade paths are gated behind meeting certain criteria. Needing to beat specific racers in order to earn the ability to purchase better parts might be a sore spot if you’re already spinning your wheels trying to lure out and beat those racers in the first place. It’s a bit of a catch-22, and it’s probably the primary reason I’m not a huge fan of these sorts of roadblocks in racing games. I’m generally of the opinion that, if you have the credits, you should just be able to buy any cars and parts within your means. At any rate, this is the sort of early access feedback that, with any luck, should provide Genki the data to smooth out bumps in its progression road.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Despite the occasional frustrating session, I’m still thoroughly addicted to vanquishing every rival I find.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the occasional frustrating session, I’m still thoroughly addicted to vanquishing every rival I find. Being able to now spot where opponents are on the map (and allowing that to dictate where you enter the expressway) is a sensible, modern touch. Each time you leave the garage represents the start of an in-game night, which concludes when you choose to return to the garage to spend your credits – or simply head straight out again for the next evening. Just <em>one more night</em>, I tell myself for the tenth time before heading back out onto the expressways in search of prey. It’s hard to quit – and not just because the option to actually do so from the garage is buried in a hidden menu I initially had no idea how to reach. You can’t do it from your controller, in case you’re wondering; you have to hit tab on your keyboard.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h15m19s286-1738916510157.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Think of the map as one huge, forking race circuit.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In more ways than just that the menu system does need refinement, as it also lacks quick D-pad support and requires us to use an analogue stick as a mouse. It’d also benefit from some kind of global BACK button shortcut, so returning to the main garage screen from elsewhere – like the tuning menus – wouldn’t require opening the menu bar and manually moving the cursor. Little tweaks like that would significantly sharpen up the process of menu navigation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Car handling, though, already has a slick, arcade feel that’s nicely tuned for smooth steering on a controller at high speed. That said, the chase view does lack the kind of looseness I crave in this sort of racing game, so even minor steering adjustments are amplified to jarring yaws by the time they reach the trailing camera. This feels like something that could be tuned, or potentially supplemented with an additional chase camera that isn’t so stiff. For now, it’s far easier to drive smoothly using bonnet cam.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h13m02s234-1738916001043.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pop up headlights are the best headlights.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The list of cars whose bonnets you can see from there is a good start, and features just under 50 Japanese models at launch. Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Daihatsu, and Suzuki are all in there. (Honda remains conspicuously absent, though.) The cars look fine without being showstopping, but they don’t pick up damage or boast a level of detail as lavish as the vehicles featured in racing genre heavy hitters like Gran Turismo 7. However, the bigger issue at the moment is how they sound. Right now Tokyo Xtreme Racer isn’t so much “extreme” as it is tinny and toothless compared to any one of its arcade racing peers, like Forza Horizon, Need for Speed, or even Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. It’s the one part of this retro game I wish <em>wasn’t</em> stuck in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, in broad terms, a lot of the usual suspects are already on these streets. The Mk3 and Mk4 Supra. Five generations of Imprezas. The R32, R33, and R34. The RX-7 and RX-8. The best Evo and the final Evo. There’s certainly plenty of room for it to grow and, looking at the car list for 2003’s Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, I’m sure I could make some fairly educated guesses regarding what may join the garage. What I will say, however, is I’d love to be more regularly surprised going forward. That is, some Japanese cars that get little to no love in video games would be <em>perfect</em>. Give us a Datsun 620. A 910 Bluebird wagon. Hell, what about a Mazda Roadpacer? I’m sure dropping in a custom four-rotor would solve its acceleration problems. Let’s go <em>nuts</em>.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tokyo Xtreme Racer is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As Civilization 7 has launched into early access ahead of its full release next week, developer Firaxis has acknowledged issues with the game highlighted by the "passionate community".</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a>, the game has received plenty of negative reviews complaining about its poor UI and lack of features, and currently sits with a Mixed rating. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7  review</a> described it as "a competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality".</p>
<p>Now, Firaxis has identified three areas it's looking to improve in a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">new update post</a>, with a full roadmap due soon.</p>

<p>The biggest priority is improving the UI, Firaxis said. "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," it explained.</p>
<p>Next up are community-requested features, which will be added in free updates. These will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Patch 1.1.0 is already due for March, which will include quality of life changes to UI, AI balance, adjustments to diplomacy, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>"We will support Civilization 7 for years to come, and your feedback remains critical in helping us grow and build the future of Civ," the post concludes.</p>
<p>Civilization 7 is the latest in the long-running strategy series, which entered early access earlier this week for those who bought its Deluxe or Founders editions. Its full release will be next week, 11th February.</p>
<p>This time, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-game-of-thrones-alum-is-lending-their-golden-pipes-to-civilization-7">game's narrator is Gwendoline Christie</a>, who played Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 25</a> has been fully cancelled, with the studio now turning its focus to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/football-manager-26">Football Manager 26</a> that fans will now expect for later this year.</p>
<p>All pre-orders of the game will be refunded, though the process for this will depend on the retailer and platform.</p>


<p>FM25 was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/football-manager-25-release-date-set-for-november-26th/">originally planned for release last November</a>, in keeping with the yearly release schedule of the sport management sim, Sports Interactive struggled with the transition to a new game engine. Initially it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">delayed by a few weeks</a>, then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/football-manager-25-has-now-been-delayed-to-march-2025/">pushed all the way back until March 2025</a>. Any further delays would bring the game too close to the end of the regular footballing season, and too close to the expected November launch of FM26, so FM25 has been cancelled and all the work will be rolled through to the next release.</p>
<p>In their statement, Sports Interactive lays out the timing of this announcement, the challenges faced, and the simple fact that the game was not yet in a fit state to release:</p>
<p><em>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</em></p>

<p><em>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of FM25 we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</em></p>
<p><em>We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line – but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</em></p>
<p><em>Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager.</em></p>
<p><em>Sports Interactive</em></p>
<p>FM25’s development was deeply affected by a switch to the Unity game engine and ambitious efforts to incorporate a full simulation of women’s football for the first time. At the time of the game’s first delay, Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It’s not clear if those will be brought back for FM26, or will still be held back until another future game.</p>
<p>in the FAQ for the cancellation, Sports Interactive stated once again that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/football-manager-24-will-not-be-updated-with-2024-25-season-data/">FM24 will not receive a 2024/25 season update</a> to players and teams. They have said, however, that they will work with game subscription partners to extend deals for FM24 through to the release of the next game.</p>

			<p>Today, KRAFTON unveiled a new game called PUBG: Blindspot. Previously known as Project Arc, this is a 5v5 team based top-down tactical shooter that reportedly features fast paced shooting inspired by PUBG.</p>
<p>PUBG: BLINDSPOT presents a real-time line of sight shared with your teammates, creating instant, non-verbal cooperation and allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates in real-time against real players.</p>
<p>In PUBG: BLINDSPOT's take on bomb missions, the attacking players will be tasked to hack into the building's hidden Crypt by installing a Decrypter. They may use grenade launchers and explosive hammers to breach walls and defenses to reach the Crypt or ambush the enemy. Defenders will instead try preventing the enemy from reaching the Crypt. They can install the Decrypter by blocking doors and setting up barricades to prevent access.</p>
<p>Weapons available in the game include assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, long-range weapons like sniper rifles and DMR, pistols, grenade launchers and more, each with their own unique characteristics and feel.</p>
<p>The characters available in PUBG: BLINDSPOT each have their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets. You will see familiar weapons such as the Mk14, AWM and P90, as well as a variety of unique gadgets such as Blue Zone Grenades, Reconnaissance Drones, Grenade Launchers and Close Quarters Explosives. And, of course, throwable staples such as flash bangs and smoke grenades make an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Official Steam Next Fest Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446700/PUBG_BLINDSPOT_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playable demo</a> will be available for download starting on February 21 as part of Steam Next Fest. The demo features ten unique characters with their own signature weapons and special tools, three intense team deathmatch maps, and four demolition mission maps featuring their own themes.</p>

They each feature a boatload of ports and will start at $1,899.99 for the 16-inch and $2,199.99 for the 18-inch.

			<p>Following two <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-further-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delays</a>, Sports Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1887773293232668799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the cancellation of Football Manager 25 after 'extensive discussion with SEGA'. The development team said it will focus on developing the next installment in the football coach simulation franchise.</p>
<p><em>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of Football Manager 25, we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</em></p>

We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</em></p>
<p>This cancellation affects all versions of the game, in case you were wondering. Automatic refunds will be issued to those who had pre-ordered the game. Furthermore, Football Manager 24 will not be updated with season 2024/25 data, as Sports Interactive said this would be a large effort that ultimately takes resources away from making the next installment.</p>
<p>A release window for Football Manager 2026 hasn't been shared yet, but the franchise has traditionally launched between November and December.</p>

<p>KRAFTON has updated the branding for the PUBG spin-off formerly known as Project ARC. It’s now called PUBG: Blindspot, and between February 21 and March 3, a demo for the top-down tactical shooter will be available exclusively on Steam.</p>



<p>If you’re coming over fresh from the battle royale experience that has existed for years, you’ll likely see PUBG: Blindspot as something entirely unfamiliar, but as a standalone title, it looks pretty good. There’s a nice hit of esports potential in Blindspot, which isn’t a fresh concept given how popular PUBG is as a competitive shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-fresh-and-engaging-experience">‘A Fresh and Engaging Experience’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, KRAFTON explained why the name ‘PUBG: Blindspot’ was chosen:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>PUBG Studios chose the name PUBG: Blindspot to reflect both the development philosophy and core gameplay elements. </em></p>



<p><em>The PUBG brand in the title represents PUBG Studios’ commitment to expanding into new genres, while Blindspot signifies the game’s innovative blend of top-down shooting and vision-based tactical play, offering players a fresh and engaging experience.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The game’s most promising mechanics suggest that this will be a much faster-paced and intense shooter compared to the relatively slow-burning environment of a battle royale. It’s a vision-based shooter, which means although it’s ‘top-down’ by perspective, you can only see enemies if they’d realistically appear in your character’s field of view.</p>



<p>Hence the name, Blindspot.</p>



<p>Like Rainbow Six Siege, Blindspot is a 5v5 shooter that allows players to utilise a range of gadgets and weapons to accomplish their goals. As a match unravels, players will find that they’re given just one life, and each round follows the traditional ‘attack vs. defend’ operating model.</p>



<p>Three months ago, KRAFTON published a first-look trailer of Blindspot, then called Project ARC:</p>

<p>Do you think PUBG: Blindspot will do well as a fundamental tactical shooter, or do we already have too many of them in the industry? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sports Interactive has announced that Football Manager 25 has officially been cancelled. The decision comes after multiple delays of the game for various development reasons.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, the studio says they will now shift focus to the next release of the game.</p>



<p>“We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal,” Sports Interactive said. “We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.”</p>



<p>Originally<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> scheduled to release last fall</a>, Football Manager 25 was then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed again</a> into March 2025. The delays come, in part, due to the game’s transition from the proprietary Sports Interactive Operating System (SIOS)&nbsp;to the Unity engine. Despite the delays, the team says it didn’t achieve what it was hoping for in multiple areas of the game “despite the phenomenal efforts of our team”.</p>



<p>“Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be,” they said. “As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.”</p>



<p>They continued by saying the game could’ve still been released “in its current state” while fixing things post launch. However, they didn’t believe it to be the right thing to do for the players who have been supporting the franchise for years. They were also “unwilling” to push the release date any further than March due to it being so late in the current season.  Instead, everything will be put towards Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>As far as why they didn’t cancel the game earlier, the team says that there was a “strong belief” that they could reach their targets for the game despite the delays. However, more challenges that came up meant that they could no longer achieve their goals.</p>



<p>“Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect,” they said. “We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.”</p>



<p>Players who pre-ordered the game will receive a full refund either through their retailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-cancelled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey, remember how back in October <a href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-sports-game-delay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had so many nice things to say about Sports Interactive, and the <em>Football Manager</em> studio's brave decision</a> to buck the sports gaming trend and go to the trouble of rebuilding their entire game on a new engine? Yeah, about that. </p><p>Turns out it's been an absolute disaster. First, in September 2024, <em>Football Manager 25's </em>international mode--where players could manage national sides like England and Brazil--<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was binned</a>. Then in October (the games are normally released in November) it was delayed until March 2025. Then promises were made that the first gameplay footage for the game would be shown in January 2025.</p><p>As you can probably tell by looking at a calendar, January 2025 came and went without said footage, leading many fans to fear the worst. Fears that have proved entirely founded, as Sports Interactive today announced that they're scrapping the whole damn thing. <em>Football Manager 25</em> is being canned and there simply won't be a game in the long-running annual series released this season.</p><p>The team's statement reads:</p><blockquote><p>Sports Interactive regret to inform that, following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25 and shift our focus to the next release.</p><p>For the large numbers of you who pre-ordered FM25, we thank you enormously for your trust and support - we're very sorry to have let you down.</p><p>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</p><p>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of FM25 we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</p><p>Due to a variety of challenges that we've been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven't achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</p><p>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close - however, we're too far away from the standards you deserve.</p><p>We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that's not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</p><div><p>Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.</p><p>Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>There'll be sadness and frustration from Football Manager obsessives in the days and weeks to come, sure! This long-running series has a lot of equally long-running fans, who are extremely passionate about the game. But hopefully, after they've all taken a deep breath, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looked at the situation and the wider sports gaming malaise in general</a>, they'll be somewhat happy with this.</p><p>Sports Interactive didn't have to do this! They could have ploughed on through the years, like EA Sports have done, and release an increasingly tired sports game that slowly bled its fanbase away, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ea-shares-slump-after-annual-forecast-cut-fans-fears-over-soccer-franchise-2025-01-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wondering all the while why sales were in decline</a>. It was a brave decision for SI to tear down their annual sports game and start over, and while it was a risk that has blown up in their faces <em>this season</em>, I'll repeat now what I said when the first delay was announced: "Whatever happens to <em>Football Manager 25</em>, I'm a lot more optimistic about <em>Football Manager 26</em> and <em>27</em> than I am about any other big sports game."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sega and Sports Interactive have scrapped Football Manager 25, and will now refocus on getting ready for the series' next release.
</p>
<p>
The announcement this morning, made as part of Sega's latest financial results, is a surprise move for the annual sporting franchise. But it follows repeated delays for FM25 - which had been billed as the biggest leap forward for the series in a generation.
</p>
<p>
Previous setbacks saw FM25 delayed twice, with its most recent postponement meaning it was set to arrive at an awkward moment, mid-football season. It would also have meant Sports Interactive needing to sell two entries in the series - FM25 and the expected FM26 - within the same calendar year. 
</p>
<p>
Now, FM25 is no more - something Sports Interactive has today issued an apology for, and said that anyone who had pre-ordered the game would now be automatically refunded. 
</p>
<p>
"For the large numbers of you who pre-ordered FM25, we thank you enormously for your trust and support – we're very sorry to have let you down," a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">statement</a> from Sports Interactive reads. 
</p>
<p>
"We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal."
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-24-cannot-be-updated-with-new-season-assets-says-sports-interactive">there will be no update to the series' most recent entry, FM24, with fresh player data</a>. This would be a "substantial undertaking" that would "divert critical resources away from the development of the next release which requires our full focus", Sports Interactive said today, and the cancellation of FM25 has not changed this.
</p>
<p>
Sports Interactive had previously said it would update fans in January 2025 - a deadline it says it was forced to miss by a week due to compliance with Sega being a publicly traded company.
</p>
<p>
"We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement."
</p>
<p>
Sports Interactive blamed the decision on "a variety of challenges that we've been open about to date, and many more unforeseen".
</p>
<p>
"As we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline," the statement continues.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we're too far away from the standards you deserve.
</p>
<p>
"We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that's not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.
</p>
<p>
"Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager."
</p>
<p>
Last year, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell sat down with Sports Interactive boss Miles Jacobson for an in-depth chat on the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">plans for the future of the Football Manager franchise</a>, and to hear why "FM25 is not a continuation of FM24". The chat covers discussion on the state of Game Pass, AI and the Premier League - plus detail on why some past Football Manager features had to go.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-patents-show-the-switch-2-joy-con-may-indeed-work-like-a-mouse-%E2%80%94-and-so-might-a-new-controller.1102779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/608018/nintendo-switch-2-patents-joy-con-pro-controller-mouse-magnets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Newly-published Nintendo patents show that the company has been exploring a version of its Joy-Con controllers that can work like a computer mouse, a feature Nintendo has hinted will be coming to the Switch 2. In its Switch 2 teaser video last month, Nintendo showed two Joy-Con controllers sliding along the ground, much like you’d move a mouse.</p><p>But mouse-like functionality may not just be limited to Joy-Cons: the patents also show that Nintendo has explored adding mouse-like functionality to a split controller with a larger, more traditionally-sized grip.</p><p>Images <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803">in one patent</a> show a Joy-Con being held horizontally, with the SR and SL buttons facing downward, and a person’s thumbs on the control sticks. This seems to indicate that the optical sensor would be facing downward so that you can hold and move the controller on a surface like a mouse. </p><p>Another image shows the left Joy-Con being used upright while the right Joy-Con is used in this mouse mode — imagine WASD, but with your Switch controllers. In a machine translation of the patent, which is in Japanese, the term “mouse operation sensor” appears 28 times, which suggests that there will be technology inside the controllers that makes them work like a mouse.</p><p>Mouse-like Joy-Con have been rumored for a while, but I’ve been wondering if or how that functionality would translate to a more standard controller. Based on the patent drawings, Nintendo has designed a split controller with more traditional console grips, and it appears that at least the right side of the controller could be placed on a surface and operated like a mouse.</p><p><a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027804">Another patent</a> shows that these Joy-Con will be able to slot into a wrist strap attachment that looks similar to the ones for the original Switch. A machine translation of that patent includes the word “magnet” 355 times, which seems to indicate that the wrist strap could attach magnetically to the Joy-Con. I’m guessing that means that the Joy-Con themselves could attach to the Switch 2 console magnetically as well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">which has been rumored</a>.</p><p>That second patent also shows what looks to be a controller dock of some kind where the Joy-Con can be laid down and presumably charged.</p><p>Patents don’t always translate directly into actual, shipping products, so it’s possible that these are designs Nintendo explored but never pursued. But given the rumors around this tech, and Nintendo’s own hints in the same direction, there’s a good chance these offer an early look at how some of the Switch 2’s new features might work.</p><div><p>Nintendo is set to release the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Switch 2</a> sometime in 2025. The company plans to reveal more about the console in a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">on April 2nd</a> and is making preparations to try to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">meet demand</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sid-meier%E2%80%99s-colonization-is-the-american-video-game.1102773/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been dying to play a 4X game lately, but having yet to really dig into <em>Civilization VII</em> (which has landed to<a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17742/sid-meiers-civilization-vii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some pretty middling reviews</a>!), and which follows in the wake of some pretty disappointing 4X games (<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Humankind</em></a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Millennia</em></a>, <em>Ara</em>) over the past few years, last week I reached back for one of my favourite--albeit contentious--games of all time: <em>Sid Meier's Colonization</em>.</p><p>I started playing it mostly because it is, to this day, the most laser-focused 4X game available, and as a result the least meandering. <em>Colonization </em>is everything the genre does best--exploration, combat, building little towns and putting little guys to work--and almost none of what it has struggled most with, like convincing diplomacy and dead turns.</p><figure></figure><p>For those who have never played (or heard!) of it: <em>Colonization </em>was released in 1994 on the PC, starts in 1492 and tasks you with choosing to represent one of four imperial European nations--England, Spain, France or the Netherlands--then setting forth to found new colonies in the new world. It is, superficially, a game very much like Sid Meier's more famous series, <em>Civilization</em>, in that you drop guys on a map, build settlements and dig roads and fields between them, but with one notable difference: in <em>Colonization</em> you are controlling a nation of individual guys.</p><p>Some are carpenters, others scouts. There are soldiers, blacksmiths, weavers, priests and teachers. The key to <em>Colonization </em>is recruiting and assigning these guys--and they're all guys--to the parts of the colonies they're best suited to, in order to maximise the amount of resources you can extract, maximise the amount of stuff you make out of those resources and maximise the amount of money you can make selling that stuff back to eager European markets.</p><figure><figcaption>This screen is where you interact with your home port in Europe, buying and selling goods and recruiting immigrants to the colonies.</figcaption></figure><p>Got a colony near a forest? Get a lumberjack and carpenter in there. Next to some mountains? Ship an ore miner over from the old country, dig that metal out of the ground and get a blacksmith to turn it into tools, which you can then turn into muskets. The degree of specialisation available to your population and settlements in this game goes <em>way </em>past <em>Civ</em>, and makes the act of choosing, growing and tending to your settlements the best in the genre.</p><p>Making <em>Colonization </em>even more interesting is that events don't meander towards a finish line, but rather towards a sharp point. The aim is to build up your colonies to a sufficient strength that you can, ala 1776, break free from your mother country. This involves a war of independence where, just like 1776, a seemingly overpowering opponent can be cut down in the woods by some plucky upstarts who know the land, which they've been building on and working for over 200 years.</p><p>Between managing your colonies, tweaking your trade market, dealing with other European nations and preparing for your own [town name] Tea Party, there's never a dull moment in <em>Colonization</em>, and the way the 4X structure works so perfectly for the setting and time period makes it feel like the entire genre was made just for this. For a game from 1994 to loom so large over the genre even&nbsp; in 2025, even after all the <em>Civilization </em>games and their competitors, is testament to the strength and clarity of its design.</p><figure><figcaption>Nearly every American tribe and nation you encounter greets you warmly and offers to share the land with you, hoping for 'everlasting peace'...</figcaption></figure><p>Only, uh. There's a reason we don't really talk about it as much these days. This is also a game with substantial problems. That land you're colonising and developing isn't empty; when you first step off your ships in 1492 you discover that the new world is home to a myriad of nations and tribes, already living in settlements and cities of their own.</p><p><em>Colonization </em>may be the perfect 4X game, but it's also the perfect expression of imperialist thought in strategy video game design, of the idea that progression is everything, that the land you're invading is there to be exploited. <em>Civilization </em>has long had this issue--it's a game that too frequently equates technological progress with dominance--but while there's little introspection to be had in that game when your musketmen roll over some tribal warriors, in <em>Colonization</em> its multiple layers of history and context are unavoidable.</p><p>To its slight credit, and I'm being extremely generous relative to the time it was released here (2009's <em>Empire Total War </em>can only wish it was this nuanced), this game isn't an overt genocide simulator. It certainly <em>allows </em>for the extermination of historical Native American tribes, ranging from the Aztecs to the Sioux, and will even reward the player for doing so by freeing up more land for colonies and offering cash prizes for the destruction of larger settlements. But you are not <em>forced </em>into that route.</p><p>Players are also given the choice--an ahistorical video game fantasy--of living peacefully alongside these nations, sharing resources and knowledge and respecting traditional boundaries. You're rewarded for this too: Tribes will send people to live with you as bonus colonists, trade with you and even teach your colonists expert and much-needed skills like fishing.</p><p>These reward pathways are lopsided though, reflecting the way so much strategy gaming has been trapped within Western history's framework. Sure, there's a peaceful option on the table, but the amount of gold and resources you get for killing the indigenous people off makes it by far the most advantageous pursuit from a gameplay perspective. <em>Colonization </em>isn't <em>making </em>you commit genocide, but in recreating a specific point in history (1492) and asking you to get to <em>another </em>point in history (1776), it's basically telling you the best way to get there is to...follow that history.</p><figure><figcaption>Your conflict with the Old World is made almost inevitable by an escalating series of taxes, which eventually cripples your trade income and forces you into revolutionary action (you can't hold "parties" forever). </figcaption></figure><p>The ultimate goal of the game, regardless of which European nation you start out as, it to build your own United States of America, and the game's story as it is, told through cutscenes and your increasingly hostile diplomacy with your ruling monarch, is full of familiar-sounding ideals when it comes to the American foundational ethos. You're embarking on a brave mission. You build a colony by enduring hardships. You end up fighting a War of Independence to protect your people, to serve freedom in its opposition against tyranny. The same touchstones you see echoing throughout American history books and popular media can be found in <em>Colonization</em>.</p><p>The thing is, the narrative arc of <em>Colonization </em>is as wafer-thin as America's; you're really just building your little video game America exactly the same way the real one was built. From the mass importation of religious fanatics, ruthless opportunists and murderous imperialists, to the seizure of vast tracts of land to the genocide of entire nations.</p><p>(It's very notable the game doesn't allow for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more gradual, Canadian or Australian-style pathway to nationhood</a>, let alone one like New Zealand's, which featured<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a formal and lasting treaty signed with the Māori people</a>).</p><figure></figure><p>The conflict between what the United States <em>thinks </em>it is and what it <em>actually </em>is has been perhaps the most dominant force in the study of American history, not to mention popular culture's depiction of it, which can range everywhere from fairy tales like <em>The Patriot</em> to <em>American History X</em>. Rarely has that played out so literally as <em>Colonization,</em> a spin-off strategy title by some guys toying with the 4X genre that has, by design or not, ended up being perhaps the most American video game ever made.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">excellent TV to pair with your PlayStation 5</a> or Xbox Series X. In fact, this TV could even be a better <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">gaming TV</a> than the LG C4.

The S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">gaming TV</a>. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">running 4K</a> at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode.

The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300 nits of brightness (for TV models 55" and up).

            <p>
Switch 2 might have been officially revealed, but there's still a whole lot we don't know about it. And while Nintendo is staying stubbornly tightlipped until April, a newly surfaced patent appears to confirm at least a few previously reported details the company has so far only teased.
</p>
<p>
Mostly, we're talking Joy-Cons here, with early reports having claimed Switch 2's detachable controllers would include a few new tricks not seen in those of the original console. That starts with magnets, with Switch 2's Joy-Cons have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-report-details-magnetic-joy-con">long been rumoured to use magnets</a> to attach to the console instead of the finicky rails system used previously.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Nintendo's <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027801&amp;_cid=P22-M6TRNW-94344-1">newly unearthed game controller patent</a>, initially filed in August 2023 and published today. "This game controller is detachably mounted to a body device that has a recess," it reads, "that comprises a first magnet and a second magnet at the bottom of the recess, and that can execute game processing."
</p>
<figure><div>

<p>
Furthermore, the patent gives some additional insight into how the magnets have been implemented to avoid randomly dropping off at inconvenient intervals. "The first button and the second button are provided in the longitudinal direction in the top surface of the protrusion," Nintendo writes. "The first button and the second button are to be pressed by a user. The first button is attracted to the first magnet by a magnetic force. The second button is attracted to the second magnet by a magnetic force."
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, the inclusion of magnets isn't much of a revelation - Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal trailer</a> already suggested as much - but Nintendo hasn't actually made it official. And it's a similar story for built-in Joy-Con mouse functionality, another rumoured feature for Switch 2. January's reveal trailer certainly lent credence to those earlier reports, what with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">including a controller sliding suspiciously around on its side</a>, but, again, it's a feature not yet made official.
</p>
<p>
Back over in the patent, however, and Nintendo has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lhjtpx27ja2b">included a diagram</a> of a right Joy-Con being used just like a mouse. Its detachable edge is face down on a surface while the user grips it mouse-style, one finger on the bumper - presumably for clicking input - and a thumb on the control stick. Other illustrations show a user dual-wielding two Joy-Cons mouse-style, like some sort of mouse-using ninja, while another shows a Joy-Con being deployed mouse-like in one hand and in standard formation in the other. Flexibility is apparently key.
</p>
<p>
It is, if nothing else, an interesting reminder that's there's still so much to learn about Nintendo's new console following a reveal that was light on just about everything. Beyond, that is, a general glimpse of Switch 2's Switch-but-more-so aesthetic, and a new Mario Kart that's managed to illicit chatter as wide ranging as 'Could this possibly be open world?!' right through to 'What on earth have they done to Donkey Kong?!'.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, no solid answers to the many questions we have about Switch 2 will likely come until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">April's Nintendo Direct</a> - which will hopefully finally include the Captain Rainbow revival we've all been waiting for. Until then, feel free to direct your gaze elsewhere on Eurogamer for a refresher of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we currently know about Switch 2</a>. You can probably add 'almost definitely magnets' and 'mouse, eh?' to that list now too.

                <p>Earlier this year, Nintendo debuted a brief first look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch 2</a> which didn't offer many details about the new console. However, there was a moment in the teaser video where the next generation of Joy-Cons appeared to move over a flat surface like a mouse. Now, <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Japanese patent application filed in August 2023</a> appears to confirm that the Joy-Cons will have mouse capabilities.</p><p>The application was publicly revealed on February 6, and it includes an early schematic for the new Joy-Con, which it describes as the "input device." The patent also states that it has "a sensor for mouse operation," which functions in a similar way that normal mice work with computers. </p><p>Adding the mouse capabilities open up some intriguing possibilities for gameplay on Switch 2. Will shooter fans have the option to use the mouse instead of the conventional controller? This could potentially work very well with PC games that were designed to be played with mouse. It's also possible that Nintendo is working on some new titles that can take advantage of these mouse functions in ways we haven't thought of yet.</p><p>What we know for sure is that more details about Switch 2 will be revealed during the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>. Thus far, Nintendo has only teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">a new Mario Kart game</a>, but there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128"> plenty of titles rumored to be heading to Switch 2</a>. EA recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/">the Madden NFL and EA Sports FC franchises could appear on Switch 2</a>. As for the previous console generation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>, but it isn't clear how many titles will be playable on both systems. Regardless, fans will be able to test out the new system for themselves at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Switch 2 experience events</a> around the world.</p>
