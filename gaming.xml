                <p><a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="nofollow ">Stop Killing Games</a>, a "consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers," has been picking up speed recently. It recently hit one million signees on its European Citizens' Initiative petition, the minimum amount it needs for the European Commission to officially respond to it. Now, the EU lobbying association Video Games Europe has offered its own statement arguing against the Stop Killing Games movement.</p><p dir="ltr">"We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable," the statement reads on Video Games Europe's <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/" rel="nofollow ">website</a>. "We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>

			<p>A new nine-minute clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> gameplay has debuted through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9sqrkte-QQ">IGN</a> that showcases protagonist Enzo embarking on a mission to bring in an enemy of Don Salieri alive.</p>



<p>The mission begins with a short cutscene where Enzo gets the order from Don Salieri himself, presenting Enzo with a chance to prove himself to Salieri and to the rest of the family. Enzo is then escorted to where he can gear up to deal with the "<em>pest problem</em>," which is how the members of the family refer to his assignment. Once he's chosen the proper tools for the job, we get a good look at the Italian countryside while Enzo drives to his target's home.</p>



<p>When he gets there, we get a good look at some stealth combat before all hell breaks loose and Enzo is exchanging bullets with guards, giving us a better look at the third-person gunplay in Mafia: The Old Country. Once he reaches his target, the gameplay fades out before the cutscene finishes, as Enzo knocks his target unconcious.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even with this clip being cut in areas where developer Hangar 13 clearly wanted to keep things hidden, it's still the best look at gameplay we'd had since 2K and Hangar 13 started to properly showcase the game earlier this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-has-gone-gold-ahead-of-its-august-release/">Mafia: The Old Country officially went gold last month</a>, ahead of its early-August release date, as Hangar 13 works to polish what it believes will be "<em>the best-looking Mafia game</em>.<em>"</em> We'll see how well it lives up to those expectations, and the rest of the expectations Hangar 13 has set for the game, when it arrives on August 8, 2025.</p>

                <p>After being announced last October, we finally have our first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-rising/news/">Destiny: Rising</a>, as well as a release date. The mobile-exclusive sci-fi RPG shooter set in Bungie's Destiny universe will be released for iOS and Android on August 28, surprising some players who theorized it would be Q1 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>The launch date was announced by Chinese development partner <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20250703/41118_1244957.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NetEase Games</a>, the company behind Marvel Rivals and Diablo Immortal, along with the game's first trailer featuring new gameplay.

The game features include single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes,  Primary and Power Weapons, and the ability to share your loadout across different character arsenals.</p><p>NetEase is also adding a new Mythic-tier rarity for gear, as well as a whole new weapon type. The developer is promising "tons of exciting loot to gather for your characters."</p><p>To get players excited and ready for the game's release, NetEase is holding a <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-registration event</a> where people can unlock special bonuses when the game launches. This event unlocks more rewards with each player milestone, which is currently sitting at five million, with the final incentive at 10 million.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/publishers-argue-online-games-would-be-%E2%80%9Cprohibitively-expensive%E2%80%9D-to-make-if-the-stop-killing-games-initiative%E2%80%99s-proposals-are-accepted.1237254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you are someone who cares even a little bit about video game preservation, then you've likely heard of the Stop Killing Games initiative. A consumer-focused movement petition with the goal of gaining enough signatures so that a new law can be proposed to the UK parliament and the European Commission to disallow publishers and developers from making games that can be taken offline and rendered unplayable. </p>



<p>"<em>An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods,</em>" the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games website reads</a>, "<em>with no stated expiration date, but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.</em> <em>This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible</em>."</p>



<p>Stop Killing Games was first started by YouTuber Ross Scott, who took Ubisoft shutting down The Crew as the match with which to light the movement's fire. There's also an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">ongoing lawsuit over The Crew being shut down</a>, but that is separate from the petition Scott began.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The largest campaign ever to stop publishers destroying games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w70Xc9CStoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Scott began campaigning for signatures, it seemed like his first win came early, when Ubisoft announced it would make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">offline versions of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a> available for players. It's unclear if the pressure from Stop Killing Games is what led to the decision, but it's difficult to imagine it wasn't a part of the conversation. However, no one (at least not video game publishers) suspected Stop Killing Games would gain enough traction to actually put pressure on the industry's largest publishers and developers. That was, until Scott announced that the petition had surpassed 1 million signatures.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The site says we have cleared 1 million signatures!  I hate being like this, but there's a chance a significant number of them aren't real.  That means we have to keep signing in overdrive mode to make up for them!  I'll have a video on this later today.<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Even with Scott warning that many of the signatures could be faked, and encouraging anyone who hasn't yet to still sign the petition, that milestone and the signs that Stop Killing Games was going to get its shot at having legislation proposed to prohibit video game makers from creating online-only games that can be shut down forever in a moment was enough for video game publishers and developers to collectively respond to the movement. </p>



<p>Video Games Europe, a collective body that represents the European divisions of the largest publishers and developers in the video game industry, and <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/about/our-board/">whose board is comprised of leaders from</a> Roblox, Warner Bros, Epic Games, EA, Activision, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Take-Two, and more, released a statement that was, unsurprisingly, in opposition to Stop Killing Games, claiming that if laws like the ones it is suggesting are passed, making online-focused games would become "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We appreciate the passion of our community;"</em> the <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement from Video Games Europe</a> began. "<em>However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We understand that it can be disappointing for players, but when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws. Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>Scott has published a response to the Video Games Europe statement, immediately pointing to the fact that Stop Killing Games isn't looking to make it impossible for publishers to discontinue their online games. "<em>We are in no way seeking to impede your</em> <em>right to discontinue online services,</em>" Scott says. "<em>We are saying you can shut down your games whenever you want, but you have to do that responsibly, in a way that doesn't take back rights you already sold to customers</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The industry is lobbying against Stop Killing Games!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5Ay_aOUcFw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Even after a year of campaigning, it is still too early to tell if Stop Killing Games will actually have any impact. The deadline for the petition to be submitted for review is soon approaching, and even after that step, legislation still has to be passed. There are still plenty of opportunities for it to die on the rack. Still, it is clear that Scott has pushed the issue far enough to the point where it could make an impact. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and the latest update for the hack-and-slash action RPG is coming very soon indeed.</p>

<p>As revealed during one of the studio's customary livestreams,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives on July 16th. That's next Wednesday at time of writing, so you won't have very long to wait for this one.</p>

<p>Just like you'd expect, Version 2.1 represents a continuation from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's massive 2.0 update</a>. Two new areas, the narrative-focused Sailume Bay and the summery Fantasy Resort, will be available for you to explore, with the former serving as the "central stage for Chapter 2's story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.1-release-date-agents.jpg?itok=ePyUPVQF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.1-release-date-agents.jpg?itok=AGp4R8na 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Agents are coming in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1.</figcaption></figure><p>As ever, you can expect to add new Agents to your lineup as well. The first, Ukinami Yuzuha, is a Support Agent who can empower other attackers and use her tanuki friend to throw candy bombs. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>Your second new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 is Alice Thymefield, an Anomaly Agent whose Blade Etiquette resource can be used to unleash devastating attacks on her opponents. A new Bangboo, Miss Esme, joins the two Agents, providing HP and energy replenishments if she's in your squad.</p>

<p>Reruns for Miyabi and Yanagi will also be available as part of Version 2.1's banners, so if you missed your chance to pick up those two Agents the first time around, you'll have another chance in this update cycle.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new minigames like surfing, sea shooting, and new fishing spots, as well as new outfits to unlock with a summery theme. There's plenty to look forward to as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and you can check out the trailer below!</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a> on July 16th.</p>

We don’t know much about it beyond that it will be some kind of revenge story, as the official description calls it a “raw chronicle of redemption and revenge.”</p><p>“In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?”</p><p>The next day, the company released a minute-long teaser that is mostly made up of footage from the first season, showing (spoilers) the original <em>Edgerunners </em>crew’s deaths. We then see silhouettes of what seems to be the new cast, with a lingering shot on what looks like a young child holding an old camcorder. I’ve seen some chatter suggesting that this girl could be the daughter of season one stars David and Lucy, but that’s just theorycrafting at this point.</p><p>While we still don’t know much, it does sound like <em>Edgerunners 2 </em>is going to be a bit of a bummer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications were leaked, fans and experts have been wondering whether Nintendo's new console would be closer in power to last generation's Sony PlayStation 4 or this generation's Microsoft Xbox Series S. </p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-qa-with-virtuos-i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our recent interview with Virtuos</a>, we received what is possibly the most in-depth technical explanation to date, courtesy of Eoin O’ Grady, Technical Director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos subsidiary), who revealed that games already running at 60 frames per second on the Xbox Series S shouldn't be hard for the Nintendo Switch 2 to run.</p>



<p><em>GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall. CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting.</em></p>



<p>One of the key performance accelerators for the Nintendo Switch 2 is, of course, the upscaler NVIDIA DLSS. We asked him why not many games support it so far, and this was his answer:</p>



<p><em>For games like Mario Kart World or the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza, which feature stylized cartoon-like aesthetics, DLSS may not be needed. Mario Kart, for instance, was in development for many years with the original Switch in mind. Games like these aren’t trying to push graphical fidelity; they have different goals for their art content and tend to hit 60 FPS without relying on DLSS. For third-party games, it’s worth noting that Cyberpunk 2077 has shipped with DLSS. Compared with the Xbox Series S and PS4 versions, DLSS evidently offers better upscaling technology, making a strong case for developers to implement it. More importantly, there are also other games that could benefit from DLSS, but don’t currently utilize it—that often comes down to how these titles are being ported. It is not as simple as taking the PC DirectX implementation of DLSS and running it on the Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, DLSS has to be integrated through Nintendo’s NVN2 graphics API, and the extra work required for this might have been deferred by some developers for their initial ports.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Say what you will about the genre, but this summer's been quite a time for gacha game releases.&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Umamusume</em></a>&nbsp;is incredibly popular, with even the most unlikely gamers diving into the fray. Hoyoverse continues to dominate the field with updates to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact" rel="nofollow">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/zenless-zone-zero" rel="nofollow">Zenless Zone Zero</a>,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>. I've dabbled with several of these in the past few weeks, but the one consuming most of my time is none other than&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's right,&nbsp;a new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/persona" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona</em></a>&nbsp;game is out, and it's another offshoot of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>. If you're like me and get engrossed in this series' narratives and hooked on the day-to-day, slice-of-life elements&nbsp;it&nbsp;offers,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>can easily grab your attention and pull you in.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-wonder-2.jpg?itok=2FnLLi8d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-wonder-2.jpg?itok=m6f5iyrc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Introducing our protagonist, Wonder.</figcaption></figure><h2>Familiar Combat with a Mobile Twist</h2>

<p>Much to my surprise<em>,&nbsp;Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is quite the ambitious title. It's easy to write it off as being a mobile game, but with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s signature art style and gameplay elements, it feels very high quality.</p>

<p>Players take control of a protagonist who, due to certain events, gets involved with the Metaverse, much like Joker from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>. The narrative is front-loaded with exposition to get players up to speed with how the whole Metaverse world works, so it might feel repetitive for players familiar with the series.&nbsp;Due to all this exposition,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;feels very similar to the opening hours of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This also means it takes quite a while to get into actual gameplay, which comprises day-to-day life elements, making friends, exploring Mementos,&nbsp;using Persona in battle, fusing new&nbsp;Persona, and the like. Once you get into the meat and potatoes of it,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>has quite a bit going on.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-combat.jpg?itok=3euo4RVK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-combat.jpg?itok=1xMvLoAp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat should look pretty familiar to you if you've played&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Turn-based combat will also click pretty fast for those familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;mechanics. You'll primarily fight demons from the&nbsp;<em>Megami Tensei</em>&nbsp;franchise, each with their own elemental weaknesses and strengths.<em>&nbsp;</em>Paying attention to demons' weaknesses and exploiting those is essential in order to succeed.</p>

<p>Exploit a weakness, and enemies are downed. Party members can do a "One More" attack (essentially the Baton Pass from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5)</em>, and that character can attack a second time. If all demons are downed in combat, you can do an All-Out Attack and deal massive damage to every enemy on the field.</p>

<p>Characters also have their own special attack gauge that fills up over time. These "Highlights" have a wide range of benefits, like dealing massive damage, buffing allies, debuffing enemies, and more, so there are a lot of tools at your disposal. The tutorials for combat and, well, almost every other mechanic aren't that great, but you'll catch on quickly as a veteran of the series.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-persona.jpg?itok=oqTh5nOr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-persona.jpg?itok=ba8X9xnj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's a look at how attacks work in the game. This is Yaoling Li's persona.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Attacks also work a little differently in&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X.&nbsp;</em>You have your regular melee and gun attacks, but Personas have fixed and unique skills. There's a bit more depth with these abilities, so rather than using "Assault Dive," Ryuji has "Pirate Tactics" which deals a set percentage relative to his attack stat, and is buffed if his "Rebound" mechanic is activated.</p>

<p>My intent is not to bog you down with tons of jargon, but just know that characters' abilities are fixed, and you can't change them around. There is one exception to this rule, and that's the player character Wonder.</p>

<p>Much like Joker, Wonder can command multiple Persona. You're able to fuse new Persona in the Velvet Room, assign new skills to them, and customize them to fit in certain combat situations. It's not quite as deep as base&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s fusing mechanics, as there are restrictions, but folks will be happy to see the return of this mechanic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-lufel.jpg?itok=RV2OnRzA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-lufel.jpg?itok=pJh462Dd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lufel! He's actually quite good.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Persona5: The Phantom X --&nbsp;</em>Gacha Hooked?</h2>

<p>To address the elephant in the room,&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;is a gacha game. All of these mechanics I mentioned, including fusing Persona as well as upgrading characters and their abilities, are tied behind an absurd amount of in-game currency. I play a lot of gacha games, and these currencies pretty much always confuse me, so there's a learning curve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, party members are locked behind gacha mechanics. You can pull for either new characters (like Joker from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5)&nbsp;</em>and powerful weapons suited only for them. Everyone has their own limits when it comes to gacha, so just know what you're getting into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best characters will, of course, be locked behind limited banners, although you're gradually given currency to pull for new characters, and there are a few characters you gain from the story that will also be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-the-phantom-thieves.jpg?itok=PZLpK7p9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-the-phantom-thieves.jpg?itok=3sD5_TDM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Limited time events, for example, may include characters you're familiar with.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>has a clever way of handling characters like Joker and Morgana being playable. These party members are called "Phantom Idols" and are products of the Metaverse rather than their real-world counterparts. And while&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is technically canon, the ongoing theory is that this game takes place within an alternate universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also so many different modes in&nbsp;this game; after all, you have to find ways to keep the player engaged. So, on top of exploring palaces and living out your daily life, there are various challenges that'll absolutely put your builds to the test. By doing this, of course, you get more currency for gacha pulls.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-subway-slammer.jpg?itok=Lhv6Kh19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-subway-slammer.jpg?itok=3tKACdpW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's just standing there... menacingly.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Silly Saga of the Subway Slammer</h2>

<p>I swear, my Twitter feed has been nothing but the Subway Slammer since&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X</em>'s launch. If you're wondering who that is, well, you'll learn pretty quick by playing through the story. Like in&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>, some characters need a change of heart, and our first target is ex-baseball player Takeyuki Kiuchi, aka the&nbsp;Subway Slammer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Subway Slammer is a guy that just loves slamming into women on the subway. His habits are purposely misogynistic and actually stem from a social issue in Japan. There are reports of people slamming into others on the subway in order to satisfy some sick perversion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though it's a real-world issue, the Subway Slammer's saga is written in such an unintentionally funny, over-the-top way. Kiuchi is outrageous with his dialogue, so the whole situation turns into something more akin to parody than real-world commentary. And of course, the police can't do anything, despite him severely injuring a high school girl apparently, so of course, The Phantom Thieves are on the case.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-kiuchis-palace.jpg?itok=jXhIYvEj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5-the-phantom-x-kiuchis-palace.jpg?itok=cLwocUhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can imagine, The Subway Slammer has quite the ego.</figcaption></figure><p>Through Mementos, players infiltrate various rulers' Palaces in order to steal their treasure. This triggers the ruler to confess their crimes and have a change of heart. Again, this is the same deal as&nbsp;<em>Persona 5.</em></p>

<p>The first palace, Kiuchi's domain, is my favorite part of <em>Persona5: The Phantom X.&nbsp;</em>It's the meat and potatoes of&nbsp;this game, so to speak, and the palaces are truly massive. There are puzzles, plenty of enemies, narrative exposition, and more. They're truly enjoyable to explore and find every bit of treasure you can.</p>

<p>Besides changing hearts, much of the story is how you decide to spend your day. You can choose to partake in various activities around the city, like working a part-time job or attending a club at school. These increase your social stats, but I'm still not&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;sure how these factor into&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X'</em>s gameplay.</p>

The second palace's ruler is a <em>bit&nbsp;</em>more despicable, but it doesn't hit the same way that&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>'s villains did.</p>

<p>I am, at the very least, invested in the main party. Wonder is your blank slate protagonist like Joker, but the sporty Motoha Arai and the trusty animal companion, Lufel, are very likable, as are later additions like Shun Kano. Various side characters also have eye-catching designs and engaging personalities, so I'm hoping things pick up!</p>

<p>This is a mobile&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;PC title. The mobile elements are very evident if you're playing on your computer. Using a controller would have been my favored method in playing&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X,&nbsp;</em>but the control scheme is obtuse and unresponsive. Even with the mouse and keyboard, it's clear that a touch screen was the priority here.</p>

<p>The UI and interface, by the way, is extremely cluttered.&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is known for its incredibly artsy UI, and while it's often bold in its presentation, it isn't obstructive. There are so many different buttons flashing at you on the screen at any given time, it can be quite annoying to deal with as you're trying to immersive yourself Tokyo or somewhere in the Metaverse.</p>

<p>There are a lot of smaller issues that prevent&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>from realizing its true potential. The UI and controller issues definitely hinder my enjoyment, and the story just doesn't hit the same way...&nbsp;<em>yet</em>. Even still, I'm hooked, since&nbsp;<em>Persona5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>boils down to being more&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, and more&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>can't be a bad thing, right?&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that a second season of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>is in the works, although it's probably going to be a little while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/edgerunners/status/1941584253893959928" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2</em>, as CDPR is calling it, is currently in production. It'll air on Netflix "when it's ready", according to the developer, so it sounds like the next season is at least a year or more away.</p>

<p>When it does air,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>will tell a "new standalone 10-episode story" set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, a story that Netflix and CDPR describe as "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-purple-figure.jpg?itok=VJccNPxt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-purple-figure.jpg?itok=MYuCIvMD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>is officially coming...at some point in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>Helming the new series is storyboarder Kai Ikarashi, who worked on original <i>Edgerunners&nbsp;</i>episode "Girl on Fire". He's joined by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo, as well as "returning collaborators" Masahiko Otsuka and showrunner Bartosz Sztybor.</p>

<p>Animation studio Trigger will return once again to work on the new series, so you can expect the same sort of flashy, exciting visual style <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow">the first season</a> of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>brought to the table. Spoilers ahead for the first season of&nbsp;<em>Edgerunners</em>, if you haven't seen it yet!</p>

<p>Of course, we don't yet know how the story of the new season will dovetail with the original (if, indeed, it does at all). All we know for now is that, as the trailer itself proclaims, "David is dead, but Night City lives on". We'll have to wait for another trailer to learn more, I guess.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out the debut teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away, but it does feature some stylish&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-esque visuals upon which to feast your eyes.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>news, the hotly-anticipated sequel to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cd-projekt-profits-cyberpunk-sequel-pre-production" rel="nofollow">recently entered pre-production</a>, and between that, the new <em>Edgerunners&nbsp;</em>season, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-delayed" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>Update 2.3, we're in a bit of a holding pattern when it comes to new&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>media.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Missile Command Delta Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157143/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/missile_command_delta">Missile Command Delta</a>, from developers Mighty Yell (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/big_con">The Big Con</a>) and 13AM Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/runbow">Runbow</a>), is an experience of two halves.</p>
<p>The first is a turn-based strategy take on the classic Dave Theurer-developed arcade game <strong>Missile Command</strong>; one that shouldn’t work in theory, but genuinely does. The second is a misguided attempt to add context to the strategy gameplay by placing you in an underground bunker with a group of friends, forced to unlock its mysteries via first-person perspective. Frankly, I wish this second half had been left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>But let’s start with the positives. Located throughout the bunker are terminals through which you access the ‘classic’ Missile Command setup. Here, you take control of two computer displays: the left is an approximation of the original 1980 gameplay, with missiles making their way down a hexagonal grid to the bases that you need to protect; the right shows the arsenal of defensive missiles in your inventory, displayed as ‘cards’ that you can select to use on the playing field.</p>
<figure><a title="Missile Command Delta Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157144/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the original game had you move a cursor with a trackball and point to the exact spot you wish to fire, Delta ditches this approach entirely. Instead, you select the missile you wish to use from the cards at hand, then choose from around two to four bases from which to fire. The game shows the projected path of both your own and enemy missiles, and so your objective is to wipe out all incoming fire without any reaching your bases.</p>
<p>The thing is, you can’t just select cards willy-nilly and be done with it. Each missile type has certain properties and energy costs. So, for example, the ‘M-21 Finch’ has a short range and low cost of 2, while the ‘FL-41 Terrier’ has a longer range, a larger explosion, and a higher cost of 5.</p>
<p>You can use as many cards as you wish to clear the screen until you run out, but in order to ‘ace’ each terminal, you need to keep your energy cost at or below the designated target. So if you have a target of 10 and use two ‘Terrier’ missiles at once, you’ve reached your energy limit in one go. You can keep going, but acing each terminal is often crucial to progressing the story.</p>
<figure><a title="Missile Command Delta Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157151/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game eases you into its strategy gently, but things can get real hairy later when you’ve got practically a dozen missiles to defend at once. You'll get access to new types of missiles and even shields to accommodate, adding depth to the gameplay as you go. It can take a minute to get used to the slower pace if you’re familiar with the original Missile Command, but figuring out the optimum way to defend your bases is genuinely thrilling and satisfying.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, then, that this is surrounded by a nonsensical, boring narrative in which you explore an underground bunker to unlock new areas and terminals. You play as Skye who, along with her friends Adel, Marta, and Victor, decides to spend the night in a bunker before they all go their separate ways – as you do. An unknown war is quietly brewing in the background, so while they’re down there, attacks begin to occur. Sky, thankfully, magically knows exactly what to do and how to defend the area via the main terminal. Adel puts it down to Skye’s “gamer skills”. Okay, I guess?!</p>
<figure><a title="Missile Command Delta Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157155/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing is, it never really feels like there’s a war going on. There are zero stakes at play, and the characters pretty much just decide to keep messing around with the various terminals, because that’s apparently the key to their eventual escape. There are brief moments of intrigue that kept me interested - Who is the mysterious Khan character? And what were those footsteps in the lower level? It’s surface-level stuff though, and ultimately the decision to put you in the shoes of a teenager is misguided.</p>
<p>It feels like a play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">the ‘isekai’ trope</a>, it just doesn’t really work here, though. If I’m playing a Missile Command game, the stakes need to be <em>much</em> higher. I don’t need to read Victor jokingly ruminate on whether the previous bunker inhabitants washed the dishes or not.</p>
<p>As for the actual gameplay during these segments, you’ll slowly work your way around the bunker, opening cupboards and drawers, finding new missile cards, and flipping various switches to solve puzzles and access new areas. It’s <em>fine</em>, though the visuals leave much to be desired. Rooms lack detail and atmosphere, and so instead of feeling like you’re in a mysterious war bunker filled with stories and memories, you’re instead just going through the motions, desperately trying to advance the story as quickly as possible so you can find the next terminal.</p>
<figure><a title="Missile Command Delta Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157157/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Credit where it's due, however: the music is <em>wonderful</em>. It’s a mix of ethereal, retro-inspired ambient tracks and more intense renditions during the ‘proper’ Missile Command gameplay. If the visuals fail to make you believe you’re in a genuine underground bunker, the music triumphantly succeeds. It exudes mystery and intrigue, and I often found myself pausing at times and just letting it play in the background.</p>
<p>A quick note on performance: given the rudimentary visuals, I would have expected Delta to run at 60fps, but you’re looking at 30fps throughout on Switch. It’s consistent, however, and so I have no major issues in that regard. On Switch 2, the game runs perfectly fine for the most part, but if you happen to fail during a main attack sequence, it will often crash upon reloading. Definitely something to keep in mind, and an issue I'd imagine will be patched out fairly quickly.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Missile Command Delta is an unfortunate misfire from Atari. I want to love it; heck, I <em>do</em> love the actual turn-based strategy gameplay found within the various terminals. The problem is that it's surrounded by dull explorative sections and a narrative that just doesn't resonate.</p>
<p>There's a really solid foundation here, and I'd love to see Atari explore Delta's mechanics more in the future, but a bit more thought is required in how such an intriguing concept is delivered to the player.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Anthem to Shut Down Permanently in January 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/anthem-shutdown-january-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anthem-to-shut-down-permanently-in-january-2026.1237203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher EA and developer BioWare have announced that ill-fated live-service looter-shooter (boy, that's a lot of hyphens)&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>will be shut down early next year.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the publisher's official website, the two studios confirm that&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>will cease operations on January 12th, at which point "the game will no longer be playable". There won't be any kind of single-player mode, EA and BioWare say, because&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>was "designed to be an online-only title".</p>

<p>If you've previously purchased&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>and haven't installed it for a while, you'll still be able to do so right up until January 12th, but this really is the end for the game; after that date, you can't download it or play it anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anthem-shutdown-january-2026-suits.jpg?itok=KdD0z_Wa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anthem-shutdown-january-2026-suits.jpg?itok=-KX-2qPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>won't be around for much longer, EA and BioWare say.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, it's no longer possible to purchase&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>from digital storefronts, although it will remain on the EA Play subscription service (which is also included with certain tiers of Xbox Game Pass) until August 15th.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can still spend any in-game currency you might have left over until January 12th, so if there's anything in&nbsp;<em>Anthem</em>'s shop you've had your eye on, you might want to pick it up before it's too late.</p>

<p>EA says that <i>Anthem</i>'s shutdown "has not led to any layoffs", although given that the studio appears to have just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">emerged from a fresh layoff wave</a>, that might not be the case for long. Then again, the writing's been on the wall for&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>for some time, so it's not like its shutdown has come as a surprise.</p>




<p><em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>was released in early 2019 to divided opinion. Some praised its mech combat, while others lamented its weak story and lack of content. Incidentally, our very own Sam did both of these things <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/anthem-review-biowares-b-side" rel="nofollow">when he reviewed it at launch</a>.</p>

<p>Player response was equally mixed, and while a major update known as&nbsp;<em>Anthem Next&nbsp;</em>was planned to revitalize the flagging shooter, the update was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/anthem-next-has-reportedly-been-canceled" rel="nofollow">eventually canceled in early 2021</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>has flagged ever since.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>before its shutdown in January, you can do so with an EA Play membership. It's not available separately via any other digital platforms.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> team has shared a new piece of artwork for the mobile game's 9th anniversary, hinting that a few familiar faces may be joining very soon.</p>
<p>This artwork reveals Paradox Pokémon - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-iron-valiant-roaring-moon-locations-9015">first appeared in  Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> - could well be heading to Pokémon Go. Paradox Pokémon are a special collection of Pokémon, and are either a futuristic or prehistoric version of a present day Pokémon. In the new artwork, we can see both Great Tusk (an Ancient Pokémon) and Iron Treads (a Future Pokémon).</p>

<p>In addition to these two, we can see a Mega Butterfree, another yet-to-be-released Pokémon for PoGo. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gen-6-list-x-y-kalos-region-7002">steel/ghost type Pokémon Aegislash is also in the artwork</a>, and will be arriving with the Steel and Scales event this month.</p>
<p>In addition to potential and confirmed upcoming Pokémon, it also looks like a new feature will be coming to PoGo. This is based on the character towards the left-hand side of the anniversary artwork, who is getting a thumbs up from a wrist communicator. <a href="https://x.com/ThatMonadoBoy/status/1941996071514763526">Some have suggested remote trading</a>, but it remains to be seen for now. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the inclusion of Zygarde 50 percent Forme may well be hinting at a future Route / Zygarde event. Hopefully the Pokémon Go team will reveal all soon, stay tuned!</p>

			<p>The troubles at Xbox may be far from over, as Microsoft's CFO has set an "utterly unrealistic" financial target for the division that will continue to hurt the company's gaming division in the future.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Windows Central's Jez Corden revealed on X that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood supposedly has given Xbox an utterly unrealistic financial requirement that will continue to hurt the division, suggesting that the troubles that led to the latest waves of layoffs are far from being over. The Verge's Tom Warren chimed in on the discussion, saying that these requirements are the reality of the Xbox business following the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Without the deal, Tom Warren added, revenue would be down, and the Game Pass gamble hasn't paid off yet.</p>

<p>Last week's wave of layoffs at Xbox has been particularly impacftful for a lot of game development studios under the umbrella of Microsoft's gaming division, such as Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10, which has lost over 70 employees and has reportedly been turned into a Forza Horizon support studio, Rare, whose Everwild project has been canceled, and The Initiative, which was completely shut down following the cancellation of the Perfect Dark series reboot. ZeniMax Online, developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, was also impacted by the cancellation of their next MMORPG, which was reportedly turning out so well that Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">loved the game</a> when he played it back in March. Other partner studios were also heavily impacted by the latest wave of layoffs, such as Romero Games, the studio founded by the DOOM series co-creator John Romero and his wife Branda Romero, which also  shut down following the cancellation of the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">next FPS</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Last week, Stop Killing Games - the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated - surpassed 1m signatures. But now, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - has weighed in, insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions. The games preservation movement was prompted by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.
</p>
<p>
After a year of campaigning and with an official deadline looming, last week finally saw Stop Killing Games' European petition surpass the 1m signatures needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, as that milestone was reached, organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">warned many of those signatures could be invalid</a> due to mistakes or deliberate spoofing (a practice he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4">later noted</a> was illegal on official government petitions such as this), suggesting the real tally was likely around 600–700k genuine signatures. As such, he encouraged EU citizens to continue signing it legitimately before the deadline to ensure it passes the approval process.
</p>
<p>
Yet while the exact number of legitimate petition signatures remains unclear at present, it seems the threat of its success - and a potential parliamentary hearing - has spooked video games publishers enough to spur them into action. A statement from industry body and lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents over 30 major publishers and national trade associations around Europe, has now been <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">shared on its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate the passion of our community," it reads. "However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws."
</p>
<p>
"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players," it continues, "as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.
</p>
<p>
"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">shared a brief response to Video Games Europe's statement on social media</a>, calling its arguments against allowing customers to keep their purchases "flimsy". Scott added he'd provide a more lengthy video response soon.
</p>
<p>
Away from Stop Killing Games' EU activities, the initiative's <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has now surpassed over 150K signatures. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">previous government response</a>, mandatory for any parliamentary petition that surpasses 10K signatures, said: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games". However, having now passed the 100K signatures threshold, the petition must now be considered for a debate in parliament.

<p>In sickness and in stealth</p>
</section></header><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-07T13:58:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Mon 7th Jul 2025, 2:58pm</time>]:</strong> As pointed out by Broosh in the comments, generative AI has been employed for the dialogue audio, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3034070/Spy_Drops/">a note on the game's Steam page</a>. The note reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AI Generated Content Disclosure</strong><br>
The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:<br>
<em>Generative AI is used for the audio in the dialogues. The audio used is from actors that were compensated for their work. The audio for the dialogues can be disabled in game.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We've reached out to PR asking for clarification on the exact process and more details. We'll let you know if/when we hear more.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> While Kojima fans on Switch might be feeling a little left out with all the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> buzz, not to mention the lack of 60fps options in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> (we've still got our fingers crossed for a Switch 2 update), it seems like Rainy Frog and the one-person dev Rainy Night Creations might have a little something to help scratch your itch. As long as you're looking for retro-styled stealth, that is; Dollman lovers won't find what they're looking for here. Probably.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spy_drops">Spy Drops</a> isn't shy about showing love for its stealth-action influences, that's for sure. Coming to Switch (and Steam) on 31st July, the game's story features the requisite elements of shadowy operations and shady operatives. The plot apparently unravels through randomised missions that feature PS1-style visuals and gameplay that is very explicitly channelling the escapades of one Solid Snake.</p>
<p>It seems you'll get plenty of familiar spy tech — night vision goggles, drones, grenades — you know, the essentials. The PR blurb also mentions a "Dream Catcher," which you can use to "infiltrate the minds of soldiers and discover the locations of the next targets." As you do.</p>
<p>Beyond the gameplay, one aspect definitely worth noting is that the character designs in this one have been handled by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/companies/artepiazza">ArtePiazza</a>, the Japanese developer with a rich history with Square Enix and the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, and who most recently worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> Switch remake.</p>
<p>The trailer above gives you a great idea of just how authentic-feeling the game's looking compared to the late-'90s classics it's aping. Here are a few screens and some more details from the press release:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A story that takes a turn….</strong><br>
As your mission unfolds, so does the truth behind it. What was believed to be a world-saving op in stopping a global threat quickly spirals into something far more sinister. Who can you trust when the people giving you the orders are hiding behind the biggest lie and conspiracy?<br>
-<strong>Forever replayable:</strong> experience randomly generated missions, letting you enjoy a fresh story and new challenges every time you play.<br>
- <strong>Dynamic Gameplay:</strong> from map layouts to enemy placements, no two missions are alike. Even the weather and time of day will keep you on your toes!<br>
- <strong>Stealth with Style:</strong> upgrade your character, master new stealth skills, and become the ultimate spy.<br>
- <strong>Spy Against Spy Mode:</strong> take on a friend in a head-to-head local multiplayer showdown. Who’s the better agent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's tough to tell without getting our hands on it, but it certainly looks the part, and we're intrigued by the mention of spy versus spy local competitive multiplayer, too.</p>
<p>It's out at the end of the month for £13.99/$14.99, so we can only hope that the impeccable visual vibes carry over into Spy Drops' infiltration gameplay. Let us know below if your fancy is piqued.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-trouble-canceled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-may-be-in-trouble-and-could-have-been-canceled-%E2%80%93-rumor.1237137/</guid>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">rumored Final Fantasy IX remake</a> may be in trouble, and the game could have been canceled altogether, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/post-142366968">ResetERA forums</a>, well-known insider NateDrake commented on the current status of the unannounced remake, saying that, last the insider checked, the game was still in development. However, a fresh check may be needed, as around a month ago, the insider was told the game was in trouble and possibly had been cancelled. Only one source talked about the cancellation, so the information needs to be verified first, the insider added.</p>



<p>The possibility of the Final Fantasy IX remake having been cancelled couldn't have come at a worse time, as today marks the game's 25th anniversary. Many expected July 7 would be the perfect day to announced the rumored remake, but Square Enix, however, only released a special anniversary movie, which you can watch below, to mark the occasion. You can watch the movie below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake was originally revealed via a massive GeForce NOW database leak, which revealed a lot of unreleased projects at the time. In Square Enix's case, every game revealed by the leak proved to be real, with the exception of the remake of the ninth entry in the popular JRPG series, so there's no doubt that it has been in the works at some point. Hopefully, development hasn't been canceled, and players will be able to travel across the world of Gaia with Zidane and his companions again to experience one of the best entries in the series like they never did before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The writer and producer of sci-fi anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners said he doesn't want to write a jolly story for the series, because "when people are sad", it makes him "a bit happy".</p>
<p>Edgerunners is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">animated spin-off of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-arrives-13th-september">first debuted in 2022</a>. Following acclaim, a second season is now in production for Netflix. </p><p>

News of this next season arrived during Anime Expo, along with a new trailer. "Night City lives on," reads the official blurb. You can check out the trailer below.

<p>At the same event, a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners panel was held, where writer Bartosz Sztybor was asked about the human stories told within Edgerunners' dystopian world. Here, the show's writer replied that this type of narrative is incredibly important for CDPR, and the team always wants to "write stories that are character driven".</p>
<p>Sztybor then elaborated on this point further stating: "But the other thing is that we are a company from Poland. I'm from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad." This was met with plenty of laughter from his audience.</p>
<p>When asked if he had ever considered changing things up a bit, and perhaps offering up some joyful story lines, Sztybor replied, "no", with the panel's host joking the writer liked to feast on others' misery.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for the second season of Edgerunners yet, with the team merely saying it will arrive on Netflix when it is ready. We do know, though, that it will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Edgerunners team promise "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge" on the second season's debut. "In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077 itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">it is now available on Switch 2</a>.

<p>In addition, the team at CDPR are currently cooking up another update for Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-new-update-will-have-scope-similar-to-22-as-cd-projekt-announces-delay">which will have "scope similar" to 2.2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Microsoft's latest round of layoffs, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw over 9K lose their jobs</a>, including many at various Xbox-owned gaming studios, former Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X</a> to explain that, in his opinion, Game Pass is one of the main culprits, not to mention potentially damaging to the industry as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Game Pass). I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by Microsoft’s “infinite money”, but at some point, reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.</em></p>



<p><em>What might happen once Microsoft has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up. Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsidized by Microsoft bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real</em>.</p>



<p>Colantonio is in tune with Rhys Elliott, Head of Market Analysis at Alinea, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes</a> that Microsoft bet on the wrong horse by putting so much effort into pushing its Game Pass subscription service. Games simply do not work in the same way as film or music since they take much longer to consume, and there's only so much spare time that users can dedicate to entertainment.</p>



<p>Anyway, Colantonio later added that Game Pass could only co-exist if it's focused on back catalogue games.</p>



<p><em>I’m fed up with all the BS they fed us at first, like “don’t worry, it doesn’t impact the sales”, only to admit years later that it totally does. “No shit it does! Really?” The only way Game Pass can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially Sony's strategy with PlayStation Plus: <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-says-playstation-plus-engagement-has-never-been-higher-still-wont-add-first-party-games-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never put big games there on day one</a>, only add them at a later date, when they enter the back catalogue phase. However, Microsoft is currently still very much keen to maintain its promise to consumers to bring all of its games to Game Pass when they launch. Even so, despite adding franchises like Call of Duty, Diablo, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and DOOM, the total number of subscribers is believed to be around 35 million, far lower than Microsoft's lofty goals.</p>



<p>As a side note, Raphael Colantonio is the studio founder of WolfEye Studios, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weird West</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank">.</a>&nbsp;The studio is now developing a retro sci-fi first-person action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/" target="_blank">inspired by Dishonored</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank">published by NEOWIZ</a>.
