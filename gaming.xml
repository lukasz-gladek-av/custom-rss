<p>Another Xbox console exclusive appears to be set to come to PlayStation soon. According to multiple claims, the next Xbox game will be announced for PlayStation 5 next week.</p>



<p>First, in response to a question on ResetEra about when the next ports to PlayStation would be coming, Shinobi replied, “What are you doing next week?”. He then followed up another question about multiple games coming with, “[I don’t know] about multiple [games]. But a big one at least.”</p>



<p>After that surfaced, eXtas1s posted a simple tease of a GIF that said “Feliz Cinco de Mayo”. </p>



<p>Based on that tease alone, it could be assumed that the game being announced will be Forza Horizon 5. For what it’s worth, Insider Gaming has heard similar of Forza Horizon 5 coming to PlayStation. However, we haven’t been able to confirm when that could happen.</p>



<p>If an announcement is to come next week, it could be during Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 20. Speaking of Gamescom, Insider Gaming will be on site all week for the annual event, so stay tuned for the latest gaming news live from Cologne, Germany.</p>

                <p>Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that</a> it will be changing the rules surrounding what developers and publishers can write in their store descriptions on Steam.</p><p>Starting in early September, four sections on Steam store pages will be impacted: "About The Game," "Short Description," "Any Special Announcement," and "Awards." The first new rule is that no links to other websites will be allowed in those sections, including links to social media pages. This is due to the store pages already having specific link fields for common social media platforms or websites.</p><p>No embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons will be allowed either, including ones that look like wishlist buttons, game capsules, or prices. Additionally, no images, links, or widgets that point to other games on Steam will be allowed. It basically means that developers cannot use the store page description to advertise other products on Steam.</p><p>Steam has implemented other changes recently, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-steam-store-update-makes-searching-for-games-easier/1100-6513883/" data-ref-id="1100-6513883">making it easier</a> for players to search for particular games, as well as making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/changes-to-how-steam-demos-work-are-on-the-way/1100-6525327/" data-ref-id="1100-6525327">game demos</a> easier to discover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Out of all the modern consoles available on the market, Nintendo Switch easily has the most diverse lineup of games available on the system. Nintendo itself has published over 130 games on the platform since it first launched, with thousands from third-party developers also available. Depending on whether or not you buy games physically or digitally, it can be challenging to search for where to overall best place to buy Nintendo Switch games is at any given time.</p><p>If you're new to the console and don't know where to find games, we've put together the ultimate guide on everything you need to know regarding where to buy Switch games  online or in stores. Take a look below and add some new games to your Nintendo Switch collection!</p><h2>Where to Buy Switch Games Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/nintendo-switch-games-target-circle-deal-1720436188581.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There are multiple ways to purchase Nintendo Switch games for your console. Purchasing then online tends to be the easiest way to buy any of the most popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-2">Nintendo Switch games</a>, as you can purchase digital or physical versions. Since you don't need to drive to pick up a game, you can either ship a physical copy to your home or purchase a digital key to start playing immediately. Take a look below to discover the best way to score <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">deals on Nintendo Switch games</a>. </p><h3>Best Places to Buy Digital Switch Games Online</h3><p>By far, the <strong>best place to purchase digital Switch games is the Nintendo eShop</strong>. This is directly accessible from any Nintendo Switch console. The entire library of Nintendo Switch can be bought from the eShop, with many games exclusive to the platform. Since some games are digital-only, you won't be able to buy physical or digital copies from retailers.</p><p>Speaking of, you can also buy certain digital games <a href="https://zdcs.link/jo6L2?object_uuid=8e7d805f-3ac2-4d4e-805a-00e1728dabb5&amp;t=article" target="_blank">from online storefronts such as Amazon</a>, Best Buy, Walmart, and more. These retailers will offer digital codes that you can purchase, which are sent directly to your email inbox upon payment. </p><p>Overall, it's important to pay attention to prices on both the Nintendo eShop and across retailers. The eShop tends to have many more sales throughout the year, but outlets like Amazon and Best Buy will offer discounted digital games for certain sales events that may be better than the eShop discounts.</p><h3>Best Places to Buy Physical Switch Games Online</h3><div catalogid="50d4b603-9e89-4276-b46d-2fc4e05d6650" id="206022"><div id="206022" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch Games</h3></p><div><p>The best places to buy Nintendo Switch games online right now.</p></div></div><p>As the best place to buy physical Switch games, we recommend Amazon. With a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-amazon-prime-cost">Prime membership</a>, it's incredibly easy to purchase a physical Switch game and receive lighting fast shipping. Most of the time, you can get in stock Switch games within 24 hours. Plus, Amazon doesn't charge your card for pre-orders of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a>, as the company waits until the item is in stock.</p><p>There's also other solid options like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. Though, for the latter, you'll want to be careful when purchasing, as sometimes Walmart has listings for European Switch games. These will work on your system fine, but some players do prefer to own North Amercian, ESRB-rated copies.</p><p>Beyond these picks, you can also find rare or limited Nintendo Switch physical copies at retailers like Limited Run Games and Video Games Plus. Since these games are either reprints or limited print runs, you won't be able to find these at retailers like Amazon or Best Buy.</p><p>Beyond traditional retailers, you can even buy physical Switch games directly from Nintendo! Nintendo's store has almost every Switch game published by the company available, and often, you'll find discounted titles throughout random periods of the year.</p><h2>Where Can You Still Find Switch Games in Stores</h2><p>With the physical market slowly shrinking over the last few years, sometimes it can be difficult to find Switch games in store. Luckily, there are still dozens of stores that carry all sorts of Nintendo Switch games on their shelves. Although the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-to-phase-out-sales-of-physical-media">removed its collection of Blu-rays</a>, Best Buy still offers plenty of Nintendo Switch games. It's easy to walk into any store and browse the collection of 50+ physical games available, with most of Nintendo's first-party offerings available.</p><p>Additionally, GameStop is a solid option. While we don't necessarily recommend purchasing online from the retailer, it's still easy to walk into any GameStop storefront and find a wide variety of Switch games available. In addition, other major retailers like Target and Walmart still offer physical games, but the offerings can vary depending on the store.</p><h2>When Is the Best Time to Find Discounts on Switch Games</h2><p>Collecting and purchasing Nintendo Switch games is not a cheap hobby, but you can offset some of that by buying when games are the cheapest during the year. There are many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">great times to buy video games</a>, but we recommend holding off for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>. By far, this is usually the best time to score discounts on Nintendo Switch games, both physically and digitally. Nintendo will discount many of its own titles, and you can score on hundreds of third party releases from major publishers. </p><p>The only main downside with this sales event is that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> is at the end of the year, so it can almost become a waiting game in earlier parts of the year. Overall, this Holiday will be an exceptional time to buy Switch games, especially as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is coming soon.</p><p>While the best options for physical games are limited, it's another story with digital games. The Nintendo eShop hosts countless sales events throughout the year, and it's easy to find great deals. Our advice is to pay close attention to the news posts on the Nintendo Switch home page, as those will mention any new eShop sales on the horizon. </p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Witchfire, the brand new project created by The Astronauts, a team that contains three video game veterans who worked on games such as Painkiller and Bulletstorm, is set to be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3156770/Witchfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam in Early Access</a> later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchfire - Official Early Access Showcase 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ts1ZZkx2d1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new RPG shooter has plenty of cosmic horror to explore in a dark fantasy atmosphere. For those interested in checking out Witchfire, <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfires-performance-doesnt-really-improve-much-with-dlss-3-and-the-hitches-are-still-there/">the game is already available</a> on the Epic Games Store. In addition to being on the Epic Games Store, Witchfire received an update called "The Wailing Tower," a huge new patch that adds a whole new map to explore new enemies, loot, gear, and brand-new features.</p>
<p>With the new update come brand-new levels of cosmic horror and a new raid map, the first to be released since the game was released for the Epic Games Store. In the update, Arcana power-ups now feature "prophecies" and "curses," which players can use to help or hinder them through their experience in Witchfire.</p>
<p>In Witchfire, you play as a wicked sinner turned witch hunter on their last mission to reach salvation. You have to try and overcome the Witch and her minions, which is a difficult journey, especially as you get Arcanas, which can either boost you through the game or make your struggle that much harder.</p>
<p>You also get to go on expeditions that will take you through immersive and expansive biomes, where you can choose your battleground as you fight off the Witch's minions. However, each completed encounter with the Witch's forces means you get stronger, and your arsenal improves as you make your expedition using the roguelike system called Arcana.</p>
<p>As you progress, you can craft your own Preyer, undead assassins sustained by Witchfire. Your base of operations is called the Hermitory, and there, you can design your own Preyer, where you can give them special weapons, abilities, and artifacts that will help bolster them and you through your journey.</p>
<p>While this game was released in September 2023 in Early Access on the Epic Games Store, it does not yet have a release date for Steam. However, you can wishlist it, and you'll be notified when the game is released.</p>
<p>It's noted that Witchfire will continue to change during the Steam Early Access period, where the game will continue to receive updates, bringing new areas, weapons, and enemies to the game for an even more chaotic experience.</p>
<p>As it stands, Witchfire has an estimated release date for Steam Early Access in Q4 of 2024.</p>

Part of what makes the G Pro X Superlight 2 so good is the way it balances its gaming chops with everyday good looks. The wireless mouse features a new Hero 2 sensor that tracks at 500 inches per second (and up to 32,000 DPI) and weighs just 60 grams, meaning it’s capable enough for tournament-level play without looking out of place even in a professional work environment.

It’s a bit pricey for a gaming headset, but if you frequently game on different platforms, it has a unique docking station that allows it to act as a central hub for all your systems. By routing your consoles through its HDMI passthrough ports, you can take up one less HDMI 2.1 port on your monitor or TV and switch between your consoles or PC with a tap of a button. The earcups are also incredibly comfy for long play sessions, with some great audio coming through the 40mm drivers.</p><div><p>The A50 X is the flagship wireless headset from Logitech-owned Astro.

<p>It is a sad day for BOOM Esports fans, as the popular gaming organization has officially announced they will be dropping their entire Dota 2 roster. The popular Southeast Asian team will no longer be competing in Dota 2 amidst their failure to qualify for The International 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-boom-esports-will-no-longer-compete-in-dota-2-drops-entire-roster">BOOM Esports Will No Longer Compete In Dota 2; Drops Entire Roster</h2>



<p>Following the team’s massive Dota 2 success back in 2022, where they placed well during The International 2022, the team has struggled to continue with victories as such. Many, who loved and cheered for BOOM Esports during those days, were saddened to hear the news of the organization dropping the entire roster.</p>



<p>“We’re changing our Dota 2 roster from active to inactive and allowed all of our players to search for new opportunities,” said BOOM Esports on Twitter (August 14, 2024).</p>



<p>The five-player team still plans to compete together under a new name, Team Waska. </p>



<p>The team posted on Twitter earlier today, stating they will be looking for new representation going into the next Dota 2 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-every-player-on-team-waska">Every Player On Team Waska:</h4>



<ul>
<li>ParkerDota2</li>



<li>DarkMago</li>



<li>Sacredota</li>



<li>MatthewDotaaa</li>



<li>Yadomi</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, the team will be able to find a new home following their departure from BOOM Esports.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-boom-esports-compete-in-the-2025-dota-season">Will BOOM Esports Compete In The 2025 Dota Season?</h2>



<p>Whether or not BOOM Esports will compete next year in the 2025 Dota 2 season is unknown. While this could just be a complete overhaul to their Dota 2 roster, it could also mean they will no longer pursue competition within the popular MOBA.</p>



<p>As the year progresses, fans will just have to wait in anticipation on whether the popular esports team dives back into the Dota scene, or if they have quit the game for good.</p>

            <p>
Amazon has reportedly commissioned a new animated anthology series for its Prime Video streaming service that'll feature new stories set across a variety of existing video game worlds, including Spelunky and Amazon's own New World.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Hollywood news publication <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/prime-video-secret-level-animated-video-game-series-tim-miller-blur-1236040365/">Deadline</a>, whose sources say the series - which is reportedly titled Secret Level - is being developed by Tim Miller and his Blur Studio, the creative team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated sci-fi show Love, Death &amp; Robots.
</p>
<p>
In fact, it sounds like Amazon's new project will follow a similar template to Netflix's anthology series. In a similar fashion to Love, Death &amp; Robots - whose standalone episodes are largely adaptations of existing short stories - Secret Level will reportedly feature original short stories set within the worlds of existing video games.

<p>
Exactly which games will feature hasn't yet been revealed, but Deadline suggests Derek Yu's critically acclaimed Spelunky, Amazon's middling MMO New World, and a number of unspecified PlayStation titles will all make an appearance.
</p>
<p>
The publication says a full reveal for Secret Level will likely happen during Gamescom Opening Night Live, which kicks off next Tuesday, 20th August, at 7pm BST.
</p>
<p>
Amazon, of course, already had one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">hit video game adaptation</a> on its hands, thanks to the release of its live-action Fallout TV show earlier this year. Secret Level has a high bar to clear then, even if it doesn't currently need to worry about Amazon's God of War adaptation, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-god-of-war-tv-adaptation-is-officially-go">announced back in 2022</a> but still appears some considerable way off.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-the-star-wars-outlaws-system-requirements.953433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-system-requirements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While Ubisoft may not have the best reputation regarding the graphical fidelity of what they show off versus what we get to play on day one, there’s no denying that many of their open-world titles do have a certain graphical charm. They’re often relatively simple to run, too. With that in mind, here are the Star Wars Outlaws system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-run-star-wars-outlaws">Can You Run Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>Overall, the Star Wars Outlaws system requirements don’t appear too taxing on either end of the spectrum. You certainly don’t require the most expensive graphics card on the market, which is a nice change of pace. Of course, the better your system, the more gorgeous those screenshots come out!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT / Intel Arc A750</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7 8700K / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 65 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5 10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 65 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-star-wars-outlaws-have-a-performance-mode">Will Star Wars Outlaws Have a Performance Mode?</h2>



<p>While there’s no concrete evidence either way, we suspect Star Wars Outlaws will launch with a visual and/or performance mode on consoles. Ubisoft titles typically do provide a performance mode for lower-end systems, and for those who would rather prioritize frame rate over graphical fidelity. However, you should still be able to tweak your game’s settings to your liking.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s a lot to unpack with Star Wars Outlaws, especially if you have questions about the game’s various mechanics. For instance, many want to know if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-star-wars-outlaws-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws is multiplayer</a>. Well, we have your answer!</p>

                <p>We're less than a week away from the release of Black Myth: Wukong on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

In some respects, you could call Wukong an adaptation. For instance, the game's main character, the Destined One, is a nod to a primary character from book named Sun Wukong (the Monkey King). The Destined One's wields the Monkey King's magical staff (Ryu Jingu Bang). Considering the parallels, souls-like fans who are interested in Black Myth: Wukong may also want to read Journey to the West and its sequels.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems.953418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Chinese Room's Senior Narrative Designer and Writer, Sarah Longthrone, has explained more details about the dialogue choice systems in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 in a brand-new dev diary.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this dev diary</a>, The Chinese Room explains how the dialogue systems help shape the world and provide depth for the characters in the game by shaping them with conversation. The dialogue systems help players determine each character's preferences and biases and how they perceive different characters in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/">the game</a>.</p>
<p>They discuss how you can play Phyre in multiple ways and how you get them to react to certain topics and characters, which is up to you. Whether you lean into their age, potency, and power to intimidate other characters around them, or you choose to let the other character think they have control in the conversation by being gentler with them and more inquisitive. Alternatively, you can confuse the other characters by answering questions with more questions to be able to pull back the curtains on other characters.</p>
<p>However, while you control a certain character and you can choose how they think and react in situations, other characters' will also begin to have their own perceptions, reactions, and interpretations of conversations.</p>
<p>They wanted to build on nuance in the conversation since, when you are in control of conversations in a game, sometimes they go on to say it in a completely different tone than what you intended, or the message is wrong. The Chinese Room wanted to avoid this in conversations within Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>The dev diary explains how you can jump to two extremes in conversation by either using your power and age to show off the big guns, but as stated in the dev diary, "throwing your weight around isn't always the best option, especially in a world overrun with big egos and at least thirteen different species of narcissist."</p>
<p>Instead, you can convince the other characters that they have the advantage and make them out to be stronger and superior, only to flip it on them when you need to. You can convince others that you can be trusted and give them a listening ear when they need it, which is a great way to gain more information that can benefit you in later situations.</p>
<p>You will be allowed to read more about your relationships as you play the game to see how members of your clan perceive you and whether you need to sweeten the deal with some of them throughout your game experience.</p>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/outer-worlds-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at E3 2021 with a hilarious self-aware trailer. We haven't heard anything more about it until now. Obsidian Entertainment CEO Feargus Urquhart talked a bit about the RPG sequel as part of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with YouTube channel Limit Break Network.</p>
<p><em>It's going really well. It's always very easy for us to say that because that's what we should say, but no, it actually is. I'm really impressed with the team. Whenever we have a big game being made, the studio gets together and we figure out how to ship a game. We're making sure it's everything that it needs to be, and we tried to create a pretty good semi-porous membrane between Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 so we're really able to support that team.</em></p>
<p><em>Luckily, the lead programmer is the same lead programmer. Leonard Boyarsky is the same creative director, Brandon Adler is still the game director, and Matt Singh, who was a tester on New Vegas,&nbsp;he's the head of gameplay and content. We were very lucky, we have a lot of people on that game that get it and have worked on the first one and worked for us for a very long time. I've actually been really impressed.</em></p>
<p><em>We had a really hard time at the studio during COVID. We got acquired, and then COVID happened, and we're trying to get The Outer Worlds and the DLC done, and we're trying to move Avowed forward. We wanted to get The Outer Worlds 2 moving, Grounded was moving, and Josh was working on Pentiment. There was just all this stuff happening, and to be honest, we were kind of a crappy developer for about a year and a half.&nbsp;There was talk of, do we stop work on The Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed? I appreciate Microsoft, because we said no, we will get there with all these games. </em></p>
<p><em>Are they going to be on the timelines that we originally thought? No, but we're going to get there, and I think that's been proven. Grounded turned out awesome, Pentiment turned out awesome, Avowed is going to be great, The Outer Worlds 2 is looking incredible. We have a base now with everything we did for Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2 &nbsp;with how we use unreal and all the tools that we've been developing for years and years to go off and make the whole next generation of games.</em></p>
<p>The Obsidian CEO also <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> he'd love to make a Shadowrun game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cosmere-rpg-community-creates-roll20-demiplane-rolling-tool</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cosmere-rpg-community-creates-a-roll20-demiplane-rolling-tool.953412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cosmere-rpg-community-creates-roll20-demiplane-rolling-tool<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tabletop community has been tucking into the preview materials of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cosmere RPG</a>. The officially licensed adaptation of Brandon Sanderson's work released playtest materials on the Roll20 and Demiplane VTTs. Now thanks to on savvy Reddit user, there is a community-made Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool available.</p>
<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane Rolling Tool Development</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the Cosmere RPG Kickstarter page, several VTTs are hosting different preview material. Fantasy Grounds has a beta rules preview. Roll20 hosts the prewritten adventure Bridge Nine. Lastly, Demiplane showcases a free character creator.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roll20-demiplane-cosmere-rpg-screenshot.jpg?itok=dzvxEgXJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roll20-demiplane-cosmere-rpg-screenshot.jpg?itok=XJvwlFar 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The development of the Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool happened due to one simple but frustration complication between these VTTs. Despite Roll20 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buying Demiplane</a>, official integration of the two VTTs hasn't been rolled out yet. This means if you joined the Roll20 campaign with a character made on Demiplane and make rolls on Demiplane, those rolls will not show up on Roll20.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmererpg/comments/1eqs5cd/new_tool_for_rolling_in_roll20_from_your/">Reddit user jackpoll4100</a>. This user wrote a tool that will allow Demiplane rolls to show up in Roll20 chat. Better still, it does not require a Roll20 Premium subscription or API and does not require any GM setup to use. Furthermore, the user made the tool work for all currently supported Demiplane character sheets – <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, etc..</p>
<p>Generally, the Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool is a user script. This means you will need a browser extension like TamperMonkey or ViolentMonkey to have it work properly. It should be noted that this tool will only work if you are running both Roll20 and Demiplane in separate tabs on the same browser. This won't allow interactions with mobile devices.</p>
<p>Once installed, there should be an extra UI element in the Roll20 chat box labelled 'Enable rolls from Demiplane.' Turn it on and any roll made from any Demiplane character sheet on your browser will be "funneled" to the Roll20 chat.</p>
<p>The Roll20 Demiplane rolling tool even includes unique dice results from different supported systems. These include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vampire-masquerade-5th-edition-review-front-loaded-lore" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade's</em></a> Bestial Failure, Messy Critical, and Standard Critical, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart's</em></a> Hope, Fear, and Critical Success, and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/avatar-legends-brings-show-to-life" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Avatar Legends</a>'</em> Miss/Weak/Strong Hit results.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220354/vr-meta-quest-roto-explorer-chair-virtual-reality</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220354/vr-meta-quest-roto-explorer-chair-virtual-reality<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.rotovr.com/products/roto-vr-explorer">Roto VR Explorer</a> chair is designed to make VR experiences feel more immersive (and less nauseating) by pairing real-world movements with what’s seen in a headset. By simply spinning a sitting user in place, it’s able to do that in a much smaller footprint than other solutions like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/7/7506249/virtuix-omni-vr-treadmill-consumer-version-ces-2015">Virtuix Omni treadmill</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/20/24045268/what-if-omnidirectional-treadmill-but-for-multiple-people-at-once">Disney’s Holo Tile treadmill</a>.</p><p>It looks like an office chair, but the Roto VR Explorer is distinguished by an oversize wheeled base with an integrated electric motor that can spin a seated user at speeds of up to 21 revolutions per minute. The chair will automatically rotate left and right to match the head turns of a user wearing a Meta Quest headset, but instead of relying on movement data captured by the Quest, the Roto VR Explorer uses its own motion-sensing head tracker attached to a head strap.</p><p>The Roto VR Explorer comes with the <a href="https://www.meta.com/ca/made-for-meta/">Made for Meta stamp of approval</a>, meaning it’s “authorized by Meta to meet our high-quality standards,” but since the head tracking is all handled by a proprietary sensor, the chair should also work with other VR headsets, as long as you’ve got a head strap to attach it to.</p><p>The speed of the chair matches the speed and intensity of a user’s head movements. A small head turn will result in barely noticeable turns or, in some cases, no movement at all, but a fast head turn will have the chair quickly accelerating to its maximum speed.</p><p>The chair claims to reduce motion sickness — a long-standing issue for many users of devices like the Meta Quest — because it adds real-world movements that coincide with what’s seen in a VR experience so the brain is less disoriented. Could you recreate a similar experience by just rotating a regular office chair with your legs? Potentially, but the movements wouldn’t be as closely matched as what’s claimed here.</p><div><figcaption><em>The height-adjustable chair features a leather upholstered seat and backrest.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Rotovrltd</cite></p></div><p>The Roto VR Explorer won’t eliminate motion sickness entirely. Users may still experience it when moving forward or backward or quickly teleporting to other areas in a VR world using a controller. Being able to physically walk around while experiencing VR is still a better approach, but the chair is designed as a compromise for smaller spaces, where full-body movements may be restricted.</p><p>Other useful features include a rumble pack mounted under the seat, providing force feedback, a modular design for attaching other unannounced accessories, and a USB port at the base of the chair that rotates so users can keep a VR headset charged without cables getting wrapped up. Locking wheels also ensure the Roto VR Explorer doesn’t slide around during intense VR experiences.</p><p>It’s available for preorder now for $799 (or £799 in the UK), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/14/check-out-this-800-rotating-vr-chair-for-meta-quest/">according to <em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>,</em> it’s expected to ship as early as October. If VR fans are experiencing a sense of deja vu, it’s because the company introduced a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZzHO-Yq8wMA">more complex version back&nbsp;in 2020</a>, which sold for over $2,000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, in recent years <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-steam-user-reviews-epic-games-store-1851554071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-steam-user-reviews-epic-games-store-1851554071">Steam store pages have become flooded by joke reviews</a></span> that are basically useless. Now, Valve has had enough and is making some changes that might  lead to fewer joke and meme reviews. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=4326355263805583415&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=4326355263805583415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On August 14, Valve published a news blog</a></span> about its plans to update Steam reviews in an effort to make them more helpful. Valve says the “primary goal” of Steam reviews is to “help potential players make informed decisions” about games they might want to buy. But the current system, where players vote on which reviews are “helpful,” isn’t working. So Valve is going to start identifying “unhelpful” reviews and make them harder to see. </p><p>According to Valve, “one-word reviews, reviews comprised of ASCII art, or reviews that are primarily playful memes and in-jokes” will now be considered unhelpful and will be “sorted behind other reviews on the game’s store page.”</p><h2 id="h2572"><a id=""></a>How is Valve identifying unhelpful, joke reviews?</h2><p>Valve clarifies that players might still see “humorous, but unhelpful” reviews, but the goal is that they show up far less often when people are just trying to learn more about a game. The company says there will be an option you can toggle on for those who like these silly reviews and still want to see them. </p><figure id="" data-id="c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-recommend-id="image://c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-format="jpg" data-width="645" data-height="515" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-recommend-id="image://c9c2bc95f3ec7e46a1e74bca38245597" data-format="jpg" data-width="645" data-height="515" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So how will Valve identify unhelpful reviews? The company says reviews will be marked unhelpful using Steam moderators, user reports, and some “machine learning algorithms.”</p><p>“Our team has found that a lot of the unhelpful reviews were easy to spot,” said Valve. “So we’re targeting those first. This is a work in process, and will likely take quite a while for our team to evaluate the existing reviews and newly posted reviews.”</p><p>You might be wondering, why even leave these unhelpful reviews up? Valve says that it’s found that “many players want to express an opinion about the game” but they don’t always have the right words to do so. So it says these sillier reviews are still “valuable data,” even if they aren’t traditional reviews. </p><p>There you go. You can still do your silly reviews, but now people won’t have to scroll through 200 of them making the same joke just to see if the game is good or not. This seems like a smart change and one which has long been overdue. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh presented an award at the 2023 Oscars. Shortly after, it was revealed that they were starring in a new indie romcom together. Last month, a trailer for <em>We Live in Time </em>was released that revealed a quirky, intimate love story racked by mysterious tragedy that might have something to do with a life-threatening disease, failed pregnancy, weird sci-fi time loops, or all three. </p><p>But no one was really paying attention until today when a no-name Twitter account suspiciously created last month seemingly dropped a previously unreleased promo shot for the movie featuring a laughing Pugh, a smiling Garfield, and an absolutely unhinged merry-go-round horse. It was a recipe for engagement and it worked. A meme factory was born. Even video game companies tried to draft off the nightmare fuel:</p><figure id="" data-id="1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-recommend-id="image://1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="679" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-recommend-id="image://1c92f6e735ca21e89ace8da03838b240" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="679" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-recommend-id="image://eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-recommend-id="image://eb851a8c0a83eb8b7ea1cfee79651002" data-format="png" data-width="931" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-recommend-id="image://a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-format="png" data-width="943" data-height="653" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-recommend-id="image://a81c0b1eaab67a4ca6b6ec1ee3e5d45e" data-format="png" data-width="943" data-height="653" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-recommend-id="image://c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-format="png" data-width="916" data-height="694" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-recommend-id="image://c484846beaf06f6b6c6b32b650db00cc" data-format="png" data-width="916" data-height="694" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And it’s worked. Before today I had no idea what this movie was called, let alone what it was about. Now I am 100 percent going to watch the next trailer for it, not to find out the mystery haunting Pugh and Garfield’s ill-fated romance but for another glimpse of this mustard-yellow hellbeast to make sure it actually exists and made it into the final cut of the movie. </p><p>  <em>We Live in Time </em>is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival next month before coming to theaters in wide release on  October 11, 2024. It’s directed by John Crowley, who real heads know for the off-beat Irish dark comedy <em>Intermission</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dustborn-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Have some patience and this punk comic book caper will win you over with its weirdos.</h2></div><div><section><p>The almost parodically melodramatic characters and odd combination of genres that make up Dustborn lead to an eye-rolling first impression, but as my crew of mutated misfits traveled across America whacking people with an upgraded baseball bat and talking about our feelings, I realized that there's a lot more to it than I first thought. Dustborn is tackling big ideas, and it's doing it with robots in bunny hats, broken-hearted biker queens, and science-fiction squid things. This mash-up of comic books, Telltale-inspired narrative adventures, and rhythm games is like a buffet of styles, story, and action, and it works better than it has any right to. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>You play as Pax, an aloof conwoman transporting secret cargo to Canada with a gang of fellow superpowered smugglers posing as a punk band. It's set in an intriguing alternate version of America where JFK was never assassinated, Marilyn Monroe is referred to as Lady Justice, and a blast of concentrated information has gifted some people with powers. Not laser eyes or flying – think more gaslighting, controlling minds with your voice, illusion magic, and more. Dustborn is primarily about making choices through dialogue and actions that drive your character toward a specific end to that road trip. Will you snuggle up with your ex? Will you tell the rest of the crew about your plan? Will you eavesdrop on their calls? (I mean that last one, obviously.) </p><p>When you're not talking to your allies through cute conversations that sound like they should come with a mental health TikTok hashtag, there is some action too. Your punk songs at gigs will play out as timed rhythm games, you’ll capture floating entities called Echos by dragging them into place with a modded handheld, and you'll even fight various people and robots by swinging around a boomerang baseball bat and using your commanding powers to push, freeze, or confuse enemies. I can never resist a bit of button-mashing music action, and while the combat is simplistic, it looks dope. I'd have liked more of these sections to balance out all the talking, but there's a good chance I'm just impatient and emotionally stunted. </p><p>Either way, the pacing is Dustborn's biggest flaw. This campaign has a slow start with enough exposition to choke a donkey, leading with a seemingly endless amount of angsty conversations before you get a chance to do anything fun with these characters. It's particularly easy to get irritated when everything you're doing seems to involve people getting kind of mad at you. Eventually you learn more about each band member and how to navigate your conversations, and there's an emotional payoff to all the chit-chat, but at first Pax and the people she's dealing with just seem a bit lame. Turns out nothing brings people together like hitting robots with a baseball bat in combat combos or rocking out as a band, and it won me over too.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>To make Dustborn worthwhile, you need to embrace the whole package.</p></div><p>Those action sequences aren’t the deepest on their own, either, so to make Dustborn a worthwhile investment you're going to need to embrace the whole package. If you're in it for just one mechanic, say the music, you'll likely lose patience waiting for your next chance to jam out. Similarly, there's no way to speed run all the emotional stuff – even if you don't care about being a stone-cold bitch to your buddies and decide to cut them off whenever possible, you're still going to need to analyze those decisions to move a chapter forward. I stuck with it because every time I was ready to bow out some part of a narrative thread gently pulled me back in, and I'm a sucker for robots and relationship drama. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Whether it's in the story setup, the variety of its characters, or the way its conflicts are approached in conversations, Dustborn has clearly made a conscious effort to be as inclusive as possible. It’s to a degree that felt performative at first, and I say that as someone who is neither straight nor entirely mentally healthy, but that philosophy eventually becomes the driving force behind what makes both these characters and your decisions concerning them far more complicated and interesting. That positive message doesn't get in the way of gameplay, because the gameplay is all about being different and finding a place in society. X-Men did it in the 80s, and now Dustborn is doing it using the issues and visual language of 2024. </p><p>When that story hits its stride and shows the confidence to have more levity in its sometimes over-serious dialogue or give you bigger chunks of autonomy, I was all in. Investigating a sinister, robot-filled research lab with my bratty little sister; getting a perfect streak during a small-town performance of a punk track; taking a robot hat shopping in an abandoned mall; using increasingly weird combos of powers in combat; it all combined with the dialogue to give emotional consequence to my choices, good or bad. I won't be going back for a replay, but I will always think fondly of that time I went on a road trip with a bunch of weirdos and set fire to a gas station. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>After the first hour, I was sure finishing Dustborn would be up there with folding laundry in terms of chores – but just a few hours later and I was invested in the welfare of all my little freaky friends as they played gigs, fought robots, and had sometimes melodramatic conversations. Its band of well-intentioned weirdos tells an absorbing story in an alternate-history America, and while I may have started by rolling my eyes, I was high on science fiction satisfaction and wondering if I was too old to get a neck tattoo and some neon accessories by the end.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><p>good</p><p>Dustborn brings angst to a comic book caper about an alternate-reality America, and you'll get an emotional ride with a few exciting punk performances if you stick with it through a slow start. </p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/rachelsbrain" title="Rachel Weber"><span></span><figcaption><p>Rachel Weber</p><div><p>Reviewed on </p><!-- --><p>PlayStation 5</p></div></figcaption></a></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the cosmetics include new outfits for Mercy, Doomfist, Sigma, Illari, and more, with highlights including a Dorothy/Tin Man skin for Ashe and a sleek, golden look for Echo. Juno is the real star of the show, though, as Blizzard teases her return following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-reveals-newest-support-hero-and-shell-be-playable-this-weekend">a weekend trial period</a> that allowed players to go hands-on last month. Overwatch 2 Season 12 launches August 20.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reaper is the Hero to win the Mythic skin for Overwatch 2 Season 12. His Anubis outfit comes with three unique styles and what appear to be special voice lines and animations. That marks two seasons in a row that a Damage Hero has gotten the Mythic skin, but that doesn’t mean Blizzard won’t have more cosmetics to reveal as New Frontiers rolls on. Specifically, toward the end of the trailer, we get a sneak peek at a large, blue broadsword that looks remarkably similar to Frostmourne, the giant melee weapon that belongs to World of Warcraft’s Lich King. It seems Blizzard is teasing a full-on World of Warcraft collaboration following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-teases-transformers-collab-in-season-11-trailer">last season’s Transformers crossover</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1es5onv/comment/li3dzy0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some keen-eyed players</u></a> noticing that the sword’s rockets suggest that Reinhardt will be one of the characters to get some love yet again.</p><p>Blizzard also oversees World of Warcraft, and with so many nods to it already polluting Overwatch 2, it’s no surprise to see the studio doubling down. What is a surprise is Overwatch 2 Season 12’s new game mode: Clash. In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24116736/embark-on-an-out-of-this-world-voyage-in-overwatch-2-season-12-new-frontiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>, Blizzard describes Clash as “an adrenaline-pumping game mode that pits teams against each other in a relentless battle for dominance over multiple capture points.” It’s a straightforward, fast-paced mode that comes with new maps Temple of Anubis and Hanaoka, which might be familiar to fans who have been playing since 2016.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Overwatch 2 Season 12: New Frontiers Trailer Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>The former carries the same name as Overwatch’s first Assault (a.k.a. Two Capture Point) map, while the latter is clearly inspired by another fan-favorite location, Hanamura. They are both undeniably similar to areas fans have begged to see return since Assault was removed with the launch of Overwatch 2, but instead of simply plopping them back in, Blizzard has reworked them from top to bottom for Clash.</p><p>Overwatch 2 Season 12: New Frontiers is also bringing health reductions for a few Damage and Support Heroes, with updates coming for Lifeweaver, too. Players can also expect new Hero Mastery Missions for Zarya and Pharah, with the 2024 Anniversary Event scheduled to launch soon, too. While Blizzard continues to tweak Competitive, it’ll soon introduce a special Xbox promotion for Game Pass holders that nets subscribers a goodie bag come September 17. Included in the offering are 30 Mythic prisms as well as the fan-favorite Cardboard Reinhardt, Turtleship D.Va, Cyberdragon Hanzo, Street Runner Genji, Bee Mercy, and Cleric Lifeweaver. The company encourages players to link their Battle.net accounts as it promises additional rewards in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Overwatch 2 Season 12 aims to take the strategic team shooter to new heights, and it’s part of a wider goal to regain player interest with a number of foundational changes. These include plans for Blizzard to begin <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">testing a return to 6v6</a> without impacting queue times and on-screen clutter.

<p>Once all the proper devs are hired, they must ensure their game has an active player base. As for some of the customization mechanics, it appears that players will be able to create their own town and, of course, a dungeon. In the dungeon, they'll be able to place whatever items they want inside, such as weapons, structures, and even enemies. All of these can be changed whenever they see fit. Players will also be able to play the game that they made.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to that, they'll also be able to make decisions that allow players to introduce classes, such as Explorers and Mages. They'll also be able to introduce other mechanics to their game, which include Monster Catching and Fishing.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's Build a Dungeon doesn't have a release date yet, but it's expected to launch on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. You can register for the <a href="https://letsbuildadungeon.com/newsletter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">beta by signing up for its newsletter</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-fast-traffic-stream-twitch-youtube<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would not be unfair to call <a href="https://x.com/tomwalkerisgood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Walker</a> a madman. It would probably be more fair to call him an Australian comedian who streams games on Twitch – because that’s what he calls himself – but actions speak louder than words. And the fact of the matter is, Walker has spent nearly half a year <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65s6_9-Gh30&amp;t=27s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempting to complete <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></a> with <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/warp-eleven-carmageddon-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mod</a> that makes traffic move so quickly that it’s almost invisible to the naked eye. Any step onto a street could be his last. Cars ping off barriers, buildings, and each other with such intensity that they build into weather events, exploding tornadoes of twisted metal. Some missions have taken hundreds of tries, and yet he persists. Why? To affirm his humanity. And because it’s very, very funny.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI_N-KSDRamydGIKwJDLcLcC_VRH0g0-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walker’s <em>GTA IV</em> playthrough</a> has proven to be a slapstick spectacle for the ages. The sheer carnage of vehicles screaming by at a million miles per hour pairs perfectly with his tentative demeanor each time a new mission begins. Walker will often map out a route that avoids traffic as much as possible, take a deep breath as he begins to shuffle in the direction of his objective, and then… immediately get hit by a car so hard that his ragdolling corpse departs the surface of the Earth. It never gets old.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New video of me beating GTA 4 with every car set to 9999 km/h is up! The mission involves pulling over three individual vans and checking their cargo. Here's how that goes: <a href="https://t.co/LemXpmbHVO">pic.twitter.com/LemXpmbHVO</a></p>— TOM (@tomwalkerisgood) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwalkerisgood/status/1815993399138476314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>As far as Walker is concerned, playing <em>GTA IV </em>this way catapults the experience into a different genre altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"It's more survival-horror than any game I've ever played,” Walker told Aftermath. “Your resources are scarce, your foes are many, you are the only thing in the world made of soft yielding flesh. … Less cars just means the silence between cars is longer, suspense builds, then a sedan slams from the horizon into you in 0.5 seconds. When a car gets into an enclosed space, they slam around as skittish and furious and violent as a necromorph."</p><p>Descending into Car Hell has forced Walker to get clever about how he manipulates <em>GTA IV</em>’s systems. For example, he’s learned from speedrunners that he can subtly shift the flow of traffic using just his in-game eyes.</p><p>"If you look down a short street, cars won't spawn there,” Walker said. “A long street will still have cars spawning far enough away that you can't affect them, but sometimes when crossing a road you can shut off one source of cars by looking left as you start to cross, then WHIP your camera around to the right as you pass the halfway point."</p><p>Walker has also realized that the streets – nearly as much as cars – are his enemy.</p><p>“The cars own the ground,” he said. “Take to the air. Take to the earth. Raised railways, bridges with walkways, tunnels, any area with clearly defined paths for the traffic to take where there's a lower chance of it ricocheting into [<em>GTA IV</em> main character] Niko.”</p><p>Some missions cause traffic to behave a little differently, a welcome reprieve that’s also taught Walker more about how <em>GTA IV</em>’s engine works.</p><p>"Scripted chase missions have what I call a 'sanity aura' around the lead car," Walker said. "The traffic around them behaves normally until they get about three car lengths away [from your position], and then they rocket away as if they've been excused from the dinner table. … Cars don't seem to become physics objects until they're closer; at a far distance, a fast car will slam into the back of a regular car, and the regular car will just tank it. If they get closer, both get completely destroyed."</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This series of <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwalkerisgood?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tomwalkerisgood</a> trying to get literally anything done in GTA4 with the traffic speed overcranked is one of the funniest things I’ve seen in weeks. Had to pause multiple times just to breathe. <a href="https://t.co/Sro9U5F3iA">pic.twitter.com/Sro9U5F3iA</a></p>— Sam Winkler (@ThatSamWinkler) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1794046322145972671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Though always ready to deploy a well-timed one-liner, Walker rarely laughs during his streams. He takes the act of playing the game pretty seriously, in part because he has to if he wants any chance of ever beating it and getting on with his life. But also, good bits often happen <em>to </em>somebody. Whether they’re getting hit in the face with a pie or a two-ton slab of metal – amplified by Newtonian physics to weigh 1,000,000 tons – it’s funnier when that person doesn't seem to be entirely in on the joke.</p><p>"I feel like I'm often too invested to react with anything other than a scream. If I'm close to a mission finish I'm opening my eyes real wide, channeling all my energy into seeing cars and trying to work out what angles could possibly work,” Walker said. “And I think it's funnier if I'm just taking it seriously the whole time.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why subject himself to this at all, though? Why grind his teeth through an endurance test where he, more than any torrential downpour of exploding cars, is the punchline? That’s where things get existential.&nbsp;</p><p>"I get the idea in my head that I will defeat stupid challenges that don't matter pretty often,” Walker said. “To me one of the most human things you can do is commit yourself to a challenge that doesn't matter, that only you care about and that you could stop doing at any time. If life is suffering, why not choose more suffering – and more life?"</p><p>Walker has his eyes on the prize. Come hell, high water, or even more cars, he’s gonna beat <em>GTA IV</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“God help me, but I am so stubborn I will finish this no matter what,” he said. “People liking it certainly makes that easier.”</p><p>After that, he’ll probably move onto <em>GTA IV</em>’s <em>The Lost and the Damned</em> DLC. Not <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, though, even though <a href="https://x.com/MonkipiQuinn/status/1795286878016684340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a similar mod</a> exists for that game. <em>GTA IV</em> holds a special place in his heart, with car handling that’s “ponderous and boatlike” and areas that are “too big and expansive.”&nbsp;</p><p>"<em>GTA V </em>is not of much interest to me," Walker said, "basically because it's... I dunno, too ‘good’?"&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
