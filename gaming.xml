            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175240/summer-game-fest-2024-best-trailers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Summer Game Fest can be hard to keep track of. The sprawling event is spread out across several days, ranging from blockbuster keynotes like SGF Live and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173601/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-microsoft">the Xbox Games Showcase</a> to smaller indie focused streams like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171195/devolver-digital-direct-2024-summer-game-fest-news-trailers">Devolver Direct</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">Day of the Devs</a>. Some games even have their own dedicated showcases. That means there’s a lot to see, which also means it’s tough to see it all. So we’ve combed through each event and pulled out the best trailers to give you a good overview of what went down and what the next few months of video game releases will look like.</p><p><h4><em>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs</em></h4></p><p>Not only did Remedy show off the first expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, but the studio also launched it: so if you’re interested in the very <em>Twin Peaks</em>-inspired new storylines (which include lots of coffee), you can play them right now.</p><p><h4><em>Arranger</em></h4></p><p>A puzzle game crossed with an RPG, <em>Arranger</em> is about, well, arranging things. It also looks incredible, with visuals from<em> Braid</em> artist David Hellman.</p><p><h4><em>Avowed</em></h4></p><div><p>We might not know exactly when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175155/avowed-might-launch-on-november-12th">this fantasy RPG from Obsidian will launch</a>, but it’s certainly shaping up to be a worthy follow-up to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Cairn</em></h4></p><p>Despite how stressful mountain climbing can be, <em>Cairn</em> looks almost cozy in this new trailer, in which a climber goes an adventure to be the first to reach a summit.</p><p><h4><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h4></p><p>The sequel to a tabletop-style cyberpunk RPG, the next <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> puts players in the role of an escaped android in a stolen ship, who also happens to have no memory. No pressure.</p><p><h4><em>Civilization 7</em></h4></p><p>As a teaser, this clip doesn’t show all that much, but it does confirm that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173575/civilization-7-summer-game-fest-2k-firaxis-trailer"><em>Civilization 7</em> is coming next year</a>, which is more than enough.</p><p><h4><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h4></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Doom</em> meets dark fantasy</a>, which means not only medieval-inspired weaponry but also apparently a mech suit and a dragon you can fly on. It looks as brutal as ever, though.</p><p><h4><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h4></p><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172872/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveal">getting a new name</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">next <em>Dragon Age</em></a> got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176005/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024">its first gameplay trailer</a> that gave a deep dive into the early moments of the upcoming RPG.</p></div><p><h4><em>Fear the Spotlight</em></h4></p><p>Blumhouse Games made its debut at SGF, and one of its first games is a PSOne-inspired survival horror title that looks delightfully retro. It’s shaping up to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">a good year for old-school horror</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></h4></p><p>The best way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">introduce a new <em>Gears</em> game</a> is with the classic “Mad World” by Gary Jules. The next entry in the franchise will be a prequel, which makes the callback very fitting.</p><p><h4><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></h4></p><p>Sony didn’t have much of a presence at the event, but the company did reveal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24172801/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-trailer-summer-game-fest">a Lego version of <em>Horizon</em></a><em> </em>that makes the post-apocalypse playful.</p><p><h4><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></h4></p><p>It’s not surprising that a new <em>Life is Strange</em> is in the works, but it’s nice to hear that <em>Double Exposure</em> will bring back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">original hero Max</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Lok Digital</em></h4></p><p>What makes this word game particularly unique is that it involves discovering a new language as you solve puzzles, which each have a strange effect on the world.</p><p><h4><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h4></p><p>Developed by an all-star cast of former <em>Persona</em> creators, <em>Metaphor</em> looks like it will be taking all of the style of that RPG series and translating it directly to a new fantasy universe.</p><p><h4><em>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">The retro experts at Digital Eclipse</a> are crafting a side-scrolling Power Rangers beat ‘em up that looks like a long-lost arcade classic.</p></div><p><h4><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h4></p><div><p>It’s tough to follow-up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">a massive, series-altering hit like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em></a>, but the next <em>MonHun</em> looks like it’ll build on its predecessor in some exciting ways.</p></div><p><h4><em>Neva</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em> is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever played</a>, and it turns out a way to make it even prettier is by adding a wolf companion in the follow-up <em>Neva</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Perfect Dark</em></h4></p><p>Years after it was first announced, we finally got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft">our first glimpse of <em>Perfect Dark</em> gameplay</a>. The futuristic spy thriller is a co-production between The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.</p><p><h4><em>Possessor(s)</em></h4></p><p>It’s from the creators of <em>Hyper Light</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820899/solar-ash-impressions-annapurna-interactive-heart-machine"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>, so you know the action will be excellent in this 2D side-scroller about escaping a “sprawling, flooded city overrun with surreal interdimensional horror.”</p><p><h4><em>Screenbound</em></h4></p><p>I’ve watched this trailer a few times, and I still can’t wrap my head around <em>Screenbound</em>’s mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay. But it seems confusing in a good way.</p><p><h4><em>Skate</em></h4></p><p>This doesn’t show much of the game, but the Tim Robinson-led video does imply that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">the next <em>Skate</em></a> will be a lot funnier and weirder than I anticipated.</p><p><h4><em>Slitterhead</em></h4></p><p>The bizarrely-named horror game comes straight from the mind of <em>Silent Hill</em> creator Keiichiro Toyama, which explains just how disturbing this new trailer is. </p><p><h4><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></h4></p><div><p>There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172134/star-wars-outlaws-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">a lot of footage of Ubisoft’s open-world <em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, and thankfully most of it focused on the <em>GTA</em>-style gameplay.</p></div><p><h4><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></h4></p><p>More than a year out from launch, many <em>Starfield</em> players are looking for something new to explore — and it looks like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">the game’s first major expansion</a> will deliver just that.</p><p><h4><em>Tenjutsu</em></h4></p><p>This brutal, pixelated action game calls to mind <em>Hotline Miami</em>, only you play as a “renegade yakuza.” Even more impressive: it’s the work of a one-person development studio.</p><p><h4><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></h4></p><p>This trailer for the slapstick comedy game reveals an August 1st release date but, more importantly, confirms that Matt Berry will be featured.</p><p><h4><em>Wanderstop</em></h4></p><p>This seems like a cozy little tea shop simulator about a retired warrior, but the end of <em>Wanderstop</em>’s reveal trailer implies that there’s something more sinister at work.</p><p><h4><em>While Waiting</em></h4></p><p>If you have the patience to make it this far into this list, your reward is... a game about being patient.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="62UQpi">The Pacific Northwest is <em>creepy</em>.</p>
<p id="rsWePZ">From the dark forests of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23932094/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, to the ghostly radios of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23791491/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-release-date"><em>Oxenfree</em></a><em>,</em> to the absolute freaks who populate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/8/21316347/deadly-premonition-2-review-switch"><em>Deadly Premonition</em></a><em>, </em>so many games set in the ol’ Pacific Northwest give it that <em>weird sauce</em>.</p>
<p id="6Es77m">This trend of Weird Pacific Northwest exists outside of games too — from quirky characters in <em>Portlandia</em> to the terrifyingly wet environment of <em>The Ring</em>.</p>
<p id="fykuv1">I wanted to know why that is, so I started looking.</p>
<p id="wvQMQ2">I came up with 122 games, mostly set in Washington (go Huskies). After whittling it down to 35, the themes of Pacific Northwest Bingo started to clarify.</p>

<p id="gUGiFF">Sixteen games were what I would describe as “creepy;” 22 of them have a supernatural element, and others emphasize survival and nature. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/28/21084016/coffee-talk-game-ps4-xbox-one-pc-nintendo-switch-impressions">One is set in a coffee shop</a>. And quite a few are mysteries.</p>
<p id="ABjwKq">But these trends didn’t <em>start </em>with video games.</p>
<p id="leLnny">Long before games made the Pacific Northwest weird, TV and movies were carving that trail, and the most notable is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23434855/twin-peaks-november-lets-go"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>.</p>
<p id="vFHZ5x">It’s me, the <em>Twin Peaks</em> enjoyer. I’ve logged on.</p>
<p id="phOrsZ">David Lynch’s soapy, surreal murder mystery debuted in April 1990, and became the blueprint for a lot of water-cooler shows today.</p>
<p id="noDGhs">On the surface, Twin Peaks is quaint and safe. But gradually, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion">a seedy underbelly</a> of gambling, sex trafficking, and drug running is revealed — to say nothing of the actual crime that instigates the whole show. Alongside all <em>that</em>, the supernatural goes from implied, to <em>very</em> real and dangerous.</p>
<p id="D4OBis">It’s hard, if not impossible, to talk about Pacific Northwest media without talking about <em>Twin Peaks</em>. But the story runs deeper than that. Along the way I spoke with Stephen Groening, associate professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Washington, about how influential <em>Twin Peaks</em> really was — and what Washington state is like now, after decades of entrenchment from companies like Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p id="Lbobz1">I also spoke with Alex Dracott, creative director and studio head of Ironwood Studios, the outfit behind <em>Pacific Drive</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24079882/pacific-drive-review-steam-pc-playstation-5"><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a gritty, complex game</a> where the player drives a busted old sedan through the Olympic Peninsula — albeit an Olympic Peninsula besieged by strange, deadly anomalies after an experiment gone wrong.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/add-nine-remastered-fps-classics-to-your-backlog-for-just-20.898473/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/2024/6/11/24176164/nightdive-classic-fps-remaster-humble-bundle-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ZSOcYw">The developers at Nightdive Studios have quickly become one of the greatest forces for game preservation by optimizing classic games for modern systems, giving them a fresh coat of paint, and updating them with modern quality-of-life features to be enjoyed by a new generation of players.</p>
<p id="bIb0px">If you’d like to see what Nightdive has accomplished in bringing some of your favorite FPS classics into the modern era, check out the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=\u0026hmb_medium=product_tile\u0026hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;hmb_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hmb_medium&quot;:&quot;product_tile&quot;,&quot;hmb_campaign&quot;:&quot;mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Nightdive FPS Remaster bundle</a> at Humble. While this $19.99 bundle doesn’t include the more recent remasters of <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, virtually every other FPS Nightdive has retouched is included (a $154 value).</p>

<p id="sX3xry">Some of these remastered titles, like <em>Powerslave</em>, <em>Forsaken</em>, and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>, are a bit dated and difficult to revisit, even in their remastered states. But this bundle also includes gems like <em>Blood</em>, the Turok<em> </em>trilogy, and the excellent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/19/21183597/doom-64-eternal-impressions-history-reboot-port-nintendo-64"><em>Doom 64</em></a>. If you never got the opportunity to play these games in their heyday, Nightdive’s remastered versions are arguably the best way to experience them.</p>
<p id="7S6Fsa">As with any other Humble Bundle, a portion of each sale benefits a specific charity, in this case, <a href="https://www.activeminds.org/about-us/mission-and-impact/">Active Minds</a>, a nonprofit focused on promoting mental health awareness and education in young adults. Just note you can always change how much of your purchase goes to the developers or to Humble directly by using the “Adjust Donation” tab before you check out.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we%E2%80%99re-finally-getting-details-on-skate-4-%E2%80%94-including-custom-socks-and-tim-robinson.898470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3fiTlI">The fourth game in EA’s cult skateboarding series — formerly known as <em>Skate 4</em>, now simply called <em>Skate</em> — is finally starting to come into focus, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/18/21296386/skate-4-ea-its-happening">four years after it was announced</a>... in a manner of speaking. Fittingly for a game which took an unusual route to becoming a reality, and which is quite a departure from its predecessors, EA is also tackling the marketing for the game a little bit differently.</p>
<p id="txcPiM">Instead of a flashy trailer highlighting the new game’s features, EA confused and delighted everyone by dropping a live-action sketch starring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em></a>’s Tim Robinson into Friday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173215/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2024">Sumer Game Fest stream</a>. In the skit, Robinson plays Richie Dandle, an executive at M-Corp, the fictional corporation that previously owned and ran the city of San Vansterdam in which <em>Skate </em>is set. Robinson denies that M-Corp is leaving San Vansterdam while employees flee, cry, and shred documents behind him. (M-Corp is probably the new iteration of the tyrannical Mongocorp, which ran the city of San Vanelona in <em>Skate 2</em>. Yes, these skating games have lore.) Anyway, the video’s pretty funny, you should watch it.</p>

<p id="MhZzk4">This is all great fun, and backed up by an official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-story-so-far">story so far</a> blog post as well as a gloriously dated <a href="https://themcorpwebsite.com/welcome">M-Corp website</a>. But what about the, you know, game?</p>
<p id="cEh2Q3">Fortunately, the developers at Full Circle, a remote-only game studio formed by EA specifically to make <em>Skate</em>, followed up the Robinson sketch by lifting the lid on the current state of the game in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/2024-development-update">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_877568xsPg">development update video</a>. <em>Skate</em>, as previously announced, will be a free-to-play, live-service skating MMO for PC and console. It doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>
<p id="4M3zVo">There’s quite a lot of detail in the post and video, none of it all that surprising; Full Circle is iterating on the Skate series’ signature “flick-it” control scheme using new physics and animation technologies, and going big on player customization. One of the most exciting tidbits is a “quick drop” system that gives players the freedom to customise the city itself, adding rails to a balcony to enhance its trick potential. You can do this in multiplayer in real time, and then challenge other players to try out your creations: Throwdowns are a way to instantly challenge other skaters as they roam around the deserted city turned giant skate park.</p>
<p id="i5PCLv">Elsewhere, much is made of the fact that players will now be able to customize the color of their socks (I’m guessing this is a top request among fans), and Full Circle promises that the game will constantly evolve over time, with new areas opening up, and new music being added to the soundtrack, too. The studio is actively appealing for new playtesters to help with development, and says it will be expanding from PC to console playtests later this year.</p>
<p id="HWD6LK">The Skate series seemed to have been consigned to history after <em>Skate 3</em> came out in 2010. But, starting around 2014, that game found a surprise second life on YouTube, as creators exploited its wild ragdoll physics for comedy. In 2016, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/10/13587630/skate-3-xbox-one-backward-compatibility">made playable on Xbox again</a>. A fan campaign for a sequel built up steam and was finally rewarded by the announcement of <em>Skate </em>in 2020.</p>
<p id="rftPsJ"><em>Skate </em>may not be quite the game fans were expecting, and it remains to be seen whether EA’s decision to build it back as a free-to-play live-service game is a mercenary business move, or a smart way to serve this passionate audience. But <em>Skate </em>doesn’t look like much else out there, and that’s something.</p>

On crime-hub planet Mirogana, neon signs inject bright pops of color into dark, seedy alleyways, droids cook strange foods at little stalls, and citizens enjoy some back-alley gambling.

But there is <em>a lot of</em> playing to do here—<em>Outlaws</em> is a third-person open-world game that features gunplay, stealth mechanics, dogfights in space, platforming, and more. My hands-on demo was on rails and I was still somewhat astounded by how much Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment have packed into this game.</p><figure id="" data-id="ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-recommend-id="image://ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess shoots her blaster at Stormtroopers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess shoots her blaster at Stormtroopers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-recommend-id="image://ea7fb0c89d0f12cffbc4f95ea1e3567d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess shoots her blaster at Stormtroopers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h21571"><a id=""></a><strong>Playing the scoundrel</strong></h2><p>I was able to play three missions during my <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> hands-on, each of which had a 20-minute timer. One required Kay to escape an Imperial ship and dogfight some TIE fighters, another saw her platforming her way around a derelict High Republic ship, and the final one tasked her with infiltrating a Crimson Dawn base on snow-covered planet Kijimi. Ubisoft was smart to give us these little slices, as each one showcased all the tools and tricks Kay has in her arsenal.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> 1<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-new-trailer-gameplay-details-spotted-1851530971&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-new-trailer-gameplay-details-spotted-1851530971">4 Cool Details We Spotted In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>’ New Gameplay Trailer</a></span></p><p>The Imperial ship level leaned into using Nix as a distraction, which requires you to hold down the left bumper on your controller to bring up some commands you can issue the little guy. He can attack enemies, distract them, or interact with objects. Distracting enemies is a bit simplistic—Nix will fall over dead in front of them so that Kay can sneak behind them and knock them out, but none of the other enemies ever noticed the bodies I was leaving behind as I snuck around. I also had to do a bit of hacking in this level, which takes the form of a Wordle-like minigame in which you try and guess which three symbols will crack the code. Guessing the wrong one will give you a big red X, the right one in the wrong spot will go yellow, and the correct one glows blue.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The High Republic level was all about platforming, which feels like a mix of the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>games and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. Kay scrambles up yellow painted grates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">yes, yellow paint is in this game</a></span>), times her jumps to avoid getting her fingers caught in vents that are opening and closing, and can use her grappling hook to latch onto certain things and swing to faraway platforms. I struggled with the platforming at certain points, partially because I am bad at platforming but also partially because Kay can feel a bit unwieldy during these segments, and this mechanic does seem to be a bit too reliant on <em>Tomb Raider</em>-esque vibes and <em>Uncharted</em>-style gags (platforms fall out from under Kay <em>a lot</em>).<br></p><p>The third mission is all about stealth, which is another thing I am very bad at. You can really only duck behind cover and crouch-walk around in order to remain hidden, or duck into an occasional vent if you can do so without getting caught (I couldn’t). Nix can only distract one person at a time, and in the Crimson Dawn base there were quite a few baddies patrolling about. Fortunately, as soon as I’m spotted, a shoot-out ensues, and those are very fun.<br></p><p>Kay wields a blaster that can swap between lethal and EMP rounds, the latter of which works great for droids, shields, and powering up dead batteries. She even has a one-shot knockout round that’s on a long cooldown, and a <em>Red Dead Redemption-</em>style ultimate ability that slows down time and lets you mark up to three enemies to take out with ease. The gunplay is pretty tight and satisfying, but don’t expect much <em>Division</em>-style cover—Kay can duck behind things and dodge roll, but <em>Outlaws</em> feels more like you’ll either be avoiding combat or going into a room guns blazing. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h21572"><a id=""></a><strong>A thoroughly <em>Star Wars</em> world</strong></h2><p>Though the gameplay was very structured and likely won’t represent the final, open-world product, I was able to get a great taste of <em>Outlaws</em>’ version of the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy— and I was very impressed by the vibes Ubisoft has curated. Kay Vess is a fantastic character, voiced with a slightly scummy, plucky perfection by Humberly González. Nix is adorable and animated, and feels at times like a secondary protagonist because of how often he gets involved, how reactive he is, and how much Kay chats with him. He’s BD-1 with teeth, and I would die for him.<br></p><p>The side characters all feel like they stepped off a movie set, and getting to delve into the seedy criminal underworld we only get tastes of in things like <em>Solo</em> is a devilish delight. Deciding who Kay will align with will affect her reputation with different factions, a mechanic which was hard to get a feel for during my hands-on, but seems like a smart way to allow players to roleplay their version of a <em>Star Wars</em> scoundrel. Everyone loves Han Solo, but what would you do if you were in his boots?<br></p><p><em>Outlaws</em>’ aesthetic is beautifully retrofuturistic. It feels like you’re playing through an unreleased ‘70s <em>Star Wars</em> film, from Kay’s shaggy haircut to the retro menu design and the tactility of the gameplay. Whenever Kay plucks her data spike from her hair to unlock a door, you’ll have to complete a little rhythm minigame by pulling the trigger in time with a flashing light, your controller vibrating with each pulse. It <em>feels</em> like you’re actually cracking the lock yourself, high praise for a lockpicking mechanic considering how they can often feel like throwaway features.<br></p><p>And though I was a little bummed that a lot of the world I encountered felt like it was behind a display case (I desperately wanted to order a drink at a bar, or sit down at a random table and play sabacc, rather than just lean on a railing via a somewhat sticky animation), these are beautiful virtual spaces that are steeped in <em>Star Wars</em> lore and vibes. And I’m sure once Ubisoft launches <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and we’re free to roam these spaces without restrictions, I’ll be even more excited for what Kay’s journey has to offer.<br></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I strike him down but more waves of enemies follow, each snaking along different routes to try and get to the Maiden Yoshiro whose divine powers are the only thing that can cleanse the shadows. Some village archers pick off a couple while others get stuck on a gate. Another group of conscripted locals attack with axes, slow the enemies’ advances with auras, or heal one another with medicines. It’s classic tower defense presented in a very novel way, and I have a hard time putting it down when my appointment ends.</p><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,194088,195719" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of several games Capcom presented at a Summer Game Fest’s adjacent Play Days event for hands-on coverage, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</em> is a mashup of horde mode strategy, action combat, and Japanese folklore presented dutifully but vibrantly across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, as well as the last-gen consoles. Made by the company’s Development Division 1, which includes the <em>Resident Evil </em>and <em>Devil May Cry </em>teams, <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>is also coming to Game Pass when it launches on July 19, making it Capcom’s 2024 subscription service successor to last year’s dino shooter <em>Exoprimal.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike that one, though, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> isn’t a live-service game. Instead it’s a more traditional single-player action strategy game that revolves around cleansing a mountain of evil spirits as you, playing as the warrior Soh, guide Yoshiro across each level so she can complete a final ritual. A day-night cycle means that time is always moving when you’re not navigating menus and ordering comrades around. Players prepare for the onslaught by rescuing villagers, killing possessed animals, and collecting spirt orbs that are the game’s currency for managing recruitments, upgrades, and buildings.</p><figure id="" data-id="0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-recommend-id="image://0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-format="gif" data-width="836" data-height="481" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soh fights of Yokai to cleanse a village.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When night falls monsters, called the Seethe, come out of randomly positioned gates to try to attack the Maiden and end her journey. If that happens, it’s game over. But guiding Yoshiro farther along each level requires blazing a path with your spirit orbs, expending currency that can’t be used for your defenses. The result is a clever tension between trying to get her through the level as fast as possible and trying to take your time to build up your defenses. Take too long and you might get punished for it. After each nighttime the next wave of enemies gets progressively stronger. While there’s no time limit, dawdling can cost you.<br></p><p>But protecting her isn’t just a matter of just positioning your limited number of class-based companions on each level and utilizing the terrain, traps, and other structures to your advantage, it’s also about combat. Following a “Dancing Swords” fighting style, Soh completes combos by linking together strong and weak attacks that increase the power of his attacks while also helping him move around the battlefield gracefully and efficiently. There’s a stamina system, a dodge roll to get out of the way of enemies’ attacks, a guard gauge that can be broken, and a special power that can be used upon building up a meter to unleash more deadly moves. It’s not full <em>Devil May Cry</em>, which some of the developers also worked on, but it controls crisply and feels satisfying enough that <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> doesn’t suffer the normal intermittent doldrums of some other tower defense games, especially in boss fights where you have to not just worry about surviving but also finishing the fight before  Yoshiro gets killed. </p><p>Where the complexity comes in, and what makes me excited to return to <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>once it’s out next month, is in how varied loadouts and maps seem to get later on. As you complete levels you collect new gear that can be swapped out for certain bonuses that also come at a cost, like stronger attacks alongside taking more damage, offering the potential to give players the trade-off management of upgrades in a roguelike. You can also unlock new classes for your allies as you go, and earn resources that can be used to choose how they’re upgraded before going out into battle again. A representative from Capcom declined to comment but grinned when I asked if Soh would get to change weapon types during the game, so there might be that to look forward to as well. </p><p>As an action-strategy nerd, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> ticked all the right boxes for me. It’s impossible to know from a 30-minute demo if it can keep ramping up its complexity and challenge in an even and rewarding way across the whole game, but the slice I played showed a lot of promise. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Steam Next Fest for June 2024 is live now through June 17, and with it comes thousands of games to try out with new betas and demos. In addition to demos, there are also special offers on games with discounted prices to check out that you may have been waiting on for a while now.</p>



<p>From action-packed first-person shooters to being an over-the-top bike messenger to even a duck-themed survival game, there are so many options to choose from this time around. To help get you going with some new games, we’ve put together a list of games you should check out between now and June 17 during Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-play-in-june-2024">10 Steam Next Fest Games You Should Play In June 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-i-am-your-beast"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Your Beast</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developer of El Paso: Elsewhere, I Am Your Beast is a first-person action game with comic book-style visuals. You play as a secret agent who’s forced to go against the Covert Operations Initiative after turning down missions because you’d rather stay retired. </p>



<p>I Am Your Beast will feature 20+ levels at launch with a fully voiced story. The game even allows you to throw your pistol as a boomerang to take out enemies. That was enough to sell me right there.</p>



<h3 id="h-striden"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052970/STRIDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STRIDEN</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>STRIDEN is the first title from 5 Fortress, a sandbox looter-shooter with some innovative – and bizarre – elements. With friends (or alone, if you’re brave), venture into a harrowing world to loot, survive, build, and ultimately escape, taking advantage of a slew of multi-generational weapons and shapeshifting abilities to dominate your enemies along the way. </p>



<p>That’s right – you can turn into a radioactive bear as the timer counts down and a toxic fog closes in around you.</p>



<h3 id="h-duckside"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Duckside is one of the crazier entries for this month’s Steam Next Fest, a survival PvP/PvE title where you get to play as a Duck wearing a goofy hat. The developers state that the game is reminiscent of titles like DayZ and Rust, with the only differentiating factor being that you are a duck, which seems exciting enough. </p>



<p>This game will have you waddling around a post-apocalyptic open world, taking down your feathered opponents by wielding automatic and explosive weapons, while building and crafting a base and tools to protect your precious loot.</p>



<h3 id="h-enotria-the-last-song"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enotria: The Last Song</a></h3>

<p>An upcoming Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. The game gives off an incredibly creepy vibe while still being absolutely stunning, visually. Where Enotria hopes to stand out is with its masks mechanic that will allow players to take on the role of your enemies by simply wearing their mask. Players will be able to quickly swap between loadouts and masks, each having their own benefits and weaknesses.</p>



<p>When it launches in the fall, the game will feature over 100 different enemies with a 40+ hour story.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>It’s always nice when a studio tries something different and new, and that’s what Parcel Corps is. It’s a game where you work as a freelance bicycle messenger who is working to simply get by until a crude oil CEO comes to try and ruin everything. The game is presented as satire on the gig economy we find ourselves in, and wants you to save the world — yes, you read that right — by making your deliveries.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Balatro was a smash hit and will likely win a number of awards this year. If you wanted more roguelike card games, then Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers might be right up your alley. Instead of Poker, however, you are playing Blackjack with the goal of beating the house. Each suit also offers an added bonus whether that be healing, protection, extra money, or extra damage.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>A Souls-lite game with a unique tagline of “Kill All Gods”. The game sees you have to fight off the Gods and their armies of the dead as they attempt to end mankind. It launches in July, but you can check out the demo now on Steam.</p>



<h3 id="h-maximum-football"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maximum Football</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for a football game with customization and both college and professional modes, Maximum Football aims to be that game for you. The game has a beta that only offers customization and exhibition play right now, but when it launches it’ll offer Dynasty and Franchise mode for players. It’ll also be completely free to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-g-i-joe-wrath-of-cobra"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2516170/GI_Joe_Wrath_of_Cobra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of beat ’em up games, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra could be the next one you are looking for. The game sees you play as one of &nbsp;Duke, Scarlett, Roadblock, or Snake Eyes, among others as you fight to stop Cobra from succeeding in their destructive plans. Developer Maple Powered Games promises a game that’s “Easy to play, hard to master”. The game will support both local and online co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-aero-gpx"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2160360/Aero_GPX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aero GPX</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve been wishing for a new F-Zero fix but are tired of waiting for an official game, Aero GPX could quench that zero-gravity thirst. Each races features 30 vehicles — or machines — all vying for first place, and they’ll do whatever it takes to get there. That means even using their machine to slam and spin opponents to improve their chances of winning. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_5_9_"></a></p>

The suits include some new designs and some that return from previous games.</p><p>Meanwhile, the update also “addresses some community feedback” and adds stability improvements to the game. This includes the ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa.</p><p>Four new suits were created in partnership with Colm Dillane, AKA KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. Yes, even Brazilian footballers are designing Spider-Man suits these days. There’s even a comment from Real Madrid forward Vini Jr, who co-developed the Ginga Suit for Miles Morales:</p><p>“I wanted it to be a celebration of Brazil’s culture and people. I just love the overall design because it has the energy and action that I associate Spider-Man with, but it’s beautifully mixed with some Brazilian flair. Which makes this suit super special and different from others.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 KidSuper Suits Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The returning suits are from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. These four suits are being “retrofitted” for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, including two for Peter and two for Miles, Insomniac said. One is the Into The Spider-Verse suit for Peter Parker, another Miles Morales’ Animated suit.

            <p>I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.
</p>
<p>Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

<p>The cats are the problem. Plenty of other games feature melee combat with dodge rolls and dopamine-tickling levelling systems, but it's the presence of cats and cat puns that throw up a red flag. They're the warning sign that you're approaching something creatively shallow, a game which has opted to court the most tired of internet memes in lieu of developing its own personality.
</p>
<p>Yet I don't feel that way about Cat Quest. Its cat puns are so relentless, so laboured, they loop back around to being charming, and its combat has a reliable, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin sort of appeal. I feel the same way about Cat Quest that I do about the similarly-named Beast Quest children's books, which likewise have a straightforward fantasy world where there's always a monster, always a magical item, always a victorious final battle. I read those books to my son, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op which my son and I played together.
</p>
<p>And Cat Quest 3 adds sea combat! No guilty pleasure, only pleasure - right?
</p>
<p>I'm going to buy this and I'm going to like it, I can tell. It's out on August 8th, but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">Steam Next Fest demo if you want to play it now</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a> has been under development for over 15 years, but it's finally reaching a 1.0 release later this year. Ahead of that happening, it's received a final major content update which seeks to make the complex, detailed roguelike more approachable. The Spring Molting update, which is out now, makes the user interface work with both mouse and gamepad, adds Steam cloud saves, and more.

<p>The new interface does look pretty friendly, with the previously overwhelming amount of text now joined by illustrative quest maps, character build layouts, and so on. It's enough - when combined with no longer needing to remember umpteen keyboard bindings - to convince me I need to give Qud another go.</p>
<p>The update also refreshes the starting town, giving it "the same lived-in texture as the rest of the world", according to the press release. There are also hundreds of new sound and visual effects, 40 new achievements, performance improvements, bug fixes, and new narrative elements. There are a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4169849469500823121">full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Caves Of Qud is the work of Freehold Games, but they've partnered with the publisher Kitfox to help get the game ready for its 1.0 release. Kitfox seem to be the de facto choice for making hardcore roguelikes playable to masses, given their work on Dwarf Fortress's 2022 Steam release.
</p>
<p>We haven't made a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since nearly ten years ago, when Marsh Davies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">covered it for our Premature Evaluation early access column</a>. Marsh found plenty to excite him in Qud's procedural generation and systemic flexibility, but ultimately felt it required "more persistent, self-flagellating or forgiving gamers" than he to really scratch beneath its surfaces. Hopefully this update, and 1.0 to follow, will change that - for my sake, if not for Marsh's.</p>

This will cause White Mask Varré’s location to change to the Rose Church in Liurnia of the Lakes.</p><figure id="" data-id="b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-recommend-id="image://b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map screen highlights the location of Rose Church." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map screen highlights the location of Rose Church." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-recommend-id="image://b67aa4dc863e309f18a7324f2a930862" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Elden Ring's map screen highlights the location of Rose Church." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speak to White Mask Varré at the Rose Church to obtain a Festering Bloody Finger.

<p>EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-players-celebrate-the-games-mac-announcement-opening-it-up-for-a-wider-community/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=palworld-players-celebrate-the-games-mac-announcement-opening-it-up-for-a-wider-community<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Apple and PocketPair have confirmed that the <em>Pokemon</em>-esque open world survival crafting game <em>Palworld</em> will be heading to Mac later this year. This was revealed during Apple’s WWDC2024 and is slated for a launch in August 2024 alongside the new Mac operating system, Apple Silicon.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true"><em>Palworld</em> is one of the biggest games coming to Mac in terms of sheer player <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-has-just-one-game-to-beat-to-become-the-most-played-release-on-steam-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numbers and popu</a>larity. It quickly racked up players after its initial launch, and now, instead of coming to PS5 first, it’s coming to a platform that many people use, but few actually play games on. However, <em>Palworld</em> fans don’t seem to mind, and they are happy that there will soon be more new players hopping in to enjoy the game they all love. </p>
 <h2 id="h-palworld-s-mac-release-will-make-the-most-of-apple-s-latest-technology" data-injectable="false"><em>Palworld</em>‘s Mac release will make the most of Apple’s latest technology</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">User Hoak-em on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/1dcs4s7/palworld_is_coming_to_macos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld</em> subreddit</a> commented, “I’m so excited. I wonder if this means that it will also be coming to other platforms like iPhone and iPad as well, since they share a universal games platform for other games like the new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.”</p>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">The feel from the community is that they’re happy more players are about to join them. There are, of course, some disgruntled comments about how the Mac launch is happening before crossplay, and the inevitable discussion of how some Macs just can’t run games. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">As a Mac user myself, I like how this will make <em>Palworld</em> a bit easier to play for more people. Yes, it’s always been possible to use Boot Camp to run Windows and play the game, but running it natively will be such a massive step forward for those of us who do game on the platform. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Apple boasts that when <em>Palworld</em> arrives on Mac, it’ll make use of systems such as HDR and MetalFX Upscaling. At the time of writing, Mac users need nothing to do to secure their copy on launch day. However, pre-order information will be released soon. </p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="false">Also launching this summer is Palworld’s first expansion, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakurajima Update</a>. It’ll hit the game on June 27, 2024, and will add a new island, more Pals, an oil rig filled with enemies to attack, and a new raid. Between this and the Mac version, there’s never been a better time to get into the game and build up your collection of Pals to work tirelessly crafting every item under the sun for you. </p>

<p data-characters="111" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>This article is sponsored by War Thunder, <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">get it on PC for free here</a> or through the PlayStation and Xbox store.</em></p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">If you truly love military games and are looking for a community to match that energy, then <em>War Thunder</em> is the game for you. The free-to-play combat MMO boasts over 70 million players, so not only are you likely to meet your new best friend on the battlefield, but you might learn a thing or two about some real-world weapons of war while doing it.</p> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="841" data-injectable="true">With all manner of historic and modern vehicles to command, you can take the fight to some of the most passionate players on the planet on land, in the air, and at sea. Perhaps your new teammates are incredibly knowledgeable about the armor structure of the Challenger 2 tank, and the turret rotation speed of the Leclerc, or perhaps you’ll learn some interesting facts about the Apache helicopter. Either way, there will be plenty to talk about while you send rounds downrange at the enemy.</p>
 <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">You can experience the thrill of combat and the adrenaline rush of victory in some of the greatest feats of military engineering that mankind has ever devised, with access to over 2500 separate, highly detailed, and expertly modeled vehicles that cover over 100 years of warfare. More than 140 maps representing different theaters of war are waiting for you to devise cunning tactics and implement your battle plans. For those players who might be a little shy about some PvP action, there are rich PvE campaigns and solo missions for you to dive into.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The remarkably passionate team of developers at Gaijin Entertainment has gone to great lengths to offer fans a challenging, exciting, and detailed experience, allowing them to feel what it is like to take on the ultimate combat challenge from the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">And that passion is met by the most uniquely enthusiastic community that sees millions of people from all over the world take part in battles every day. Remember, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of every aspect of every vehicle in the game to have fun. You definitely don’t need access to any classified documents to take advantage of everything these vehicles can do in the game, but we guess it couldn’t hurt.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">If you find yourself caught up in a heated debate about the ins and outs of jets, helicopters, tanks, or battleships, remember that it’s best to believe the person you are talking to. They may just have the evidence to back up their point. Remember, <em>War Thunder’s</em> passionate players will go to great lengths to win a match, but they’ll go even further to win an argument.</p> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">To join in the fun, you can <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">download War Thunder here</a> for free or head to the PlayStation and Xbox stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="218" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When I read the description for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640300/Evolution_Survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evolution Survival </em>demo</a> on Steam’s Next Fest page – “a survival game where the universe evolves around you” – I thought it might be a bit like <em>Spore</em>. It was not like <em>Spore</em>.</p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">The game is scheduled for release this December, and it takes place on a solitary planet inhabited by bizarre creatures and surrounded by a stunning array of stars. You wake up on an island, unclothed, unhoused, and hungry. You start gathering wood and rocks to build campfires, tools, and a primitive shelter. Or, if you’re like me, you run into an overly aggressive animal and die immediately. No worries, there’s always the next generation, though without a shelter, it’s forced to spend the night wading through darkness.&nbsp;</p>

Time is sped up in <em>Evolution Survival</em>, and it doesn’t take long for you to notice that the planet you’re trying to survive on isn’t all that stable. Sometimes,w a massive sun floats overhead, roasting you and all the other blocky little creatures alive. Occasionally, a gleaming white dwarf takes center stage in the sky, and even though it looks pretty nice, it’s not warm enough to keep the planet alive. The oceans freeze over, but wave sound effects still drift up from beneath their icy surface. Your character dies, respawns, and groans in pain as the environmental damage saps its life away over and over again until a more stable sun rises.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">The game’s evolution system doesn’t just affect the stellar bodies above you and the weather around you. As each day progresses, the animals and even the landscape start to shift. Seeing each wave of creatures take on a new shape is exciting, but I’d also find myself chasing a rock for my latest tool, only to have it vanish with the sudden passage of time. Even when it frustrated me, there was something delightful about seeing the world slowly change to take on new forms.&nbsp;</p>

In <em>3 Body Problem</em>, the characters exist in an ever-changing world, and their only hope for building a sustainable civilization is to mathematically determine their planet’s orbit between its suns. <em>Evolution Survival</em> lets you host a server for your friends, so you are trying to gather resources to build sprawling structures and form a civilization together. Unlike <em>3 Body Problem</em>, though, there’s no solution to be found and no promise of survival. </p>
 <p data-characters="627" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="false">In stable periods, <em>Evolution Survival </em>plays like a pretty straightforward survival game. When everything falls apart, and the chaos stretches on for what feels like years, the game feels a bit like an exercise in existentialism. You might be able to build a fledgling society with a server full of friends, but eventually, a rogue star will wipe you all out of existence. Still, there’s something oddly satisfying about struggling against the inevitable. At least your ruins will remain for your future generations to discover. I’ll be excited to see what the game has in store when it releases sometime in December 2024.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="518" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We all knew this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> would be another entry in Treyarch’s <em>Black Ops</em> subseries, simply titled <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. However, one interesting and exciting new addition that was kept under wraps until the recent <em>Call of Duty</em> Direct was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">omnidirectional movement</a>. This means players will be able to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, and the team at Treyarch not only hopes fans will like it, but that it’ll be popular enough to become a mainstay for future <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">On June 10, associate design director Matt Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller answered questions from the press (including <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-how-treyarch-wants-black-ops-6s-new-movement-system-to-change-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) about <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Naturally, the topic of omnidirectional movement (or Omnimovement as they’re calling it) was brought up, and Miller admitted he hopes it will become a new standard for the <em>Call of Duty</em> series when asked. He added, “I think if it’s really good, it won’t just become the standard for other <em>Call of Duty</em> games,” suggesting other developers could pick it up for their games too.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">Of course, that’s dependent on how well Omnimovement is received; something Miller is acutely aware of too: “If it’s great, people are going to want it. … So we hope we do a great job at it…” He and the rest of the team won’t need to wait too long for feedback since there will be a beta session in a few months time. There’s no exact date for it yet, but frequent <em>Call of Duty</em> leaker BobNetworkUK has said <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1800153990354837582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a> it could start from August 28.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Once <em>Black Ops 6</em> is in players’ hands, the team will be able to tweak Omnimovement when needed, especially since Miller is expecting particularly skilled players to figure out ways of exploiting the mechanic: “We’re going to continue to tweak as we get different skill levels, really good players. People who’ll find ways to exploit it. We want that, so that we can just continue to polish it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="737" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="false">It will be interesting to see if Omnimovement proves so popular with fans that Activision will want to see it present in whatever Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, the other two major <em>CoD</em> developers, work on next. There is precedent for this; the Zombies mode in Treyarch’s <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> was such a hit that it’s not only a mainstay of the <em>Black Ops</em> games, but it was also included in Sledgehammer’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-vanguard-ps4-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a></em> and Infinity Ward’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a></em>. There’s also Prestige Mode, which was introduced in the original <em>Modern Warfare</em> from 2007 and would go on to appear in almost every mainline <em>CoD</em> game ever since (though it was ironically absent in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 <em>Modern Warfare </em>reboot</a>).</p>

			<p>Our most loyal readers might recall that Atomic Heart suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ditches-ray-tracing-on-pc-at-the-very-last-minute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> its promised ray tracing features practically the day before its February 2023 launch on PC. At the time, the development team at Mundfish only said it would re-evaluate the potential addition of ray tracing after launch.</p>
<p>Nearly sixteen months after the game's release date, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/668580/view/4178857302249724169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's 1.14.4.0 update</a> has finally introduced ray tracing to the PC version of Atomic Heart, albeit in a beta state. Here's what the update log says:</p>
<p><em>Added Ray Tracing (beta) support in 3 modes**:</em><br>
<em>Performance</em><br>
<em>Quality</em><br>
<em>Balanced</em></p>
<p><em>**Requires a graphics card supporting DXR with at least 12 GB of memory for proper operation. When these modes are activated, the enabled Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting is automatically disabled. When this mode is enabled, the player’s character is not reflected in mirror surfaces.</em></p>
<p>The PC version also gets a couple of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed crashes that occurred when disabling the Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the ability to assign multiple actions to one key at once.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, all version of Atomic Heart will receive several new accessibility features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Colorblind mode (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)</em></li>
<li><em>Special contrast mode</em></li>
<li><em>Black and white mode</em></li>
<li><em>Highlight of various elements and objects</em></li>
<li><em>Disable camera shake</em></li>
<li><em>Auto QTE</em></li>
<li><em>Puzzles auto-solve</em></li>
<li><em>Auto-heal</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Following the launch of the base game, Mundfish released the Annihilation Instinct DLC and the Trapped in Limbo DLC. There are supposed to be two additional DLCs, but the developers still have to reveal any concrete details about them, including their release dates.</p>

The term at least partially stems from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list of tips from the game’s developer Billy Basso</a></span>, in which Basso discloses that “<em>Animal Well </em>is designed with three different layers.” Layers that lay over one another, revealing themselves as you play and your perspective grows. Confused? We’ve got you.<br></p><h2 id="h22547"><a id=""></a>What are <em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers?</h2><p><em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers refer to three specific goals that you can chase sequentially. The first layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is a straightforward journey that involves collecting the four Flames listed on your map and descending into a distinct final area, and played on its own will offer a very satisfying experience. The second layer involves continuing on, uncovering roughly 99% of the game’s map, hunting down collectibles and uncovering secret areas with new bosses, items, and more. The third layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is designed for hardcore puzzle solvers, featuring yet another set of collectibles that require exploiting the game’s mechanics and cross-referencing information with other players.<br></p><p>For trophy and achievement hunters, <strong>know that you only need to complete layer two to technically achieve 100% completion</strong>. Layer three is reserved for those who are determined to see everything in the game, and don’t mind looking up guides or community resources to help out. That said, can you figure out which layer you’re on in <em>Animal Well</em>? And moreover, why do some players refer to a “fourth layer” when Basso himself says there are only three? We’ll dive into those topics below.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As mentioned above, <em>Animal Well</em>’s first layer is its most straightforward. After progressing through the opening area and obtaining your map, you’ll see four flame icons hidden in each corner of the world. These correspond with four distinct biomes, each of which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336">a boss animal</a></span> that you’ll have to deal with. Along the way, you’ll need to collect at least six items that will help you solve puzzles that block your path, and you may as well grab as many eggs as you can find. It’s standard metroidvania stuff, but just <em>so</em> much fun to play.<br></p><p>Once you collect the four flames, you can place them in the center of the map, where the statues of the four boss animals hang over you. This will unlock the “final” area of the game, which will lead you to a boss encounter that, once completed, will trigger a credits sequence. Congratulations! You finished the game?</p><figure id="" data-id="42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-recommend-id="image://42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well map" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-recommend-id="image://42af8b01bd508c2d2a2a106051793788" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <strong>Your reward for completing layer one</strong>: <em>Animal Well </em>doesn’t have endings in the traditional sense, but achieve this and you’ll find a few handy items that will help you progress through what emerges as the second layer of the game. This includes the <strong>F. Pack</strong>, which will let you hold a maximum of six Firecrackers instead of three. If you’ve successfully completed a speedrun, you can also collect a figurine at the clock in this last location to commemorate your achievement. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-recommend-id="image://f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-recommend-id="image://f8916d766ab76dbfc6f99e1b2ca2e005" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Animal Well's egg room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The overarching goal of <em>Animal Well</em>’s second layer is to <strong>collect all 64 secret eggs that are hidden around the game</strong>. However, you’ll need to complete a few “quests” first, since <strong>you’ll need a total of twelve different usable items</strong> to complete this task.

If you get stuck, visit the egg room near the center of the map and reference which shelves are still missing eggs. This will help you determine which eggs you specifically need to hunt down.<br></p><p>After collecting all 64 eggs, you’ll unlock an extra key item in the egg room. Take this item to a secret room in the “final” area in the game, and you’ll trigger a new final boss sequence that resembles how layer one ended. Congratulations! You finished the game again?</p><figure id="" data-id="244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-recommend-id="image://244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-recommend-id="image://244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <strong>Your reward for completing layer two</strong>: You’ll see the credits roll once more and achieve what one might generously call the “true ending” of the game.

So, as you may guess from this hint, <strong>the objective of layer three is to find 16 bunnies hiding behind predominantly esoteric puzzles</strong>. Whereas layers one and two were exploration based, layer three will involve decoding ciphers (which typically involve using the Animal Flute) and looking carefully at background details  for clues. You’re bound to have noticed loads of these while playing earlier, but now’s the time to put on your detective hat.</p><p><strong>You <em>will </em>get stuck in layer three of Animal Well without outside help</strong>, for two distinct reasons<strong>. </strong>Firstly, the puzzles here are tricky enough that you’ll want to trade tips and tricks with others to find every hidden bunny. Secondly, one bunny specifically requires assembling a puzzle that consists of 50 distinct pieces, and you’ll only see <em>one</em> of them on your file. In other words, unless you have at least 49 friends playing this game alongside you, you’re going to need to look up solutions here.<br></p><p>Fortunately, if you’re determined to solve layer three all on your own, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can click here to use a tool that will help you solve this 50-person puzzle on your own</a></span>.<br></p><p>After collecting the 16 bunnies, a new puzzle will appear inside the house you found after completing layer one. By solving this, you’ll get a series of directions that you’ll need to follow by flying on the manticore in the ending area of layer two. This will take you to a secret island that houses a neat secret for your troubles. Congratulations! You very probably actually finished the game!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Your reward for completing layer three</strong>: Unlike the first two layers, the credits won’t roll again.

Instead, <em>Animal Well</em>’s fourth layer consists of carrying out incredibly specific tasks across multiple playthroughs, that the game doesn’t necessarily hint at, to unlock a series of symbols (usually referred to as unicode or wingdings). These include tasks like speedrunning the game, letting a boss hit you several times on Groundhog Day, and circumventing the solution of a layer two puzzle.<br></p><p>By piecing these clues together, you can uncover another series of directions similar to the end of layer three, which unlocks yet another secret.

<p>Just days after announcing a number of games during Summer Game Fest, British game developer Sumo Digital — the studio behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others — has announced that layoffs are coming to the company.  The studio is set to let go 15% of its workforce, or 160 people, across five different countries.</p>



<p>The news of the layoffs was first revealed by <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1800565013700280422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter</a>. It also comes just days after parent Sumo Group announced a number of new games from the company.</p>



<p>According to the company, the layoffs come due to “recent difficulties” that the studio has “not been immune” to. This has lead to a decision to reduce costs “in a number of ways”.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dead-by-daylight-dev-makes-more-layoffs">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/">Dead by Daylight Dev Makes More Layoffs</a></h6>



<p>Shortly after the layoffs were revealed, Sumo Digital <a href="https://x.com/SumoDigitalLtd/status/1800566419735576756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released the following statement</a>:</p>



<p>“Over the last 21 years Sumo has grown from small beginnings into a family of studios across the UK and the world, which we’re incredibly proud of.</p>



<p>“While we have been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months, is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>



<p>“The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>



<p>“This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future.”</p>



<p>The latest set of layoffs now puts the total <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known amount to roughly 10,561</a> within the gaming industry. The number surpasses the 10,500 known layoffs from 2023 within the first six months of the year.</p>

McCaffrey is the sixth running back to serve as the cover athlete, following <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition">Adrian Peterson</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition-past-gen">Barry Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-12">Peyton Hillis</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2003">Marshall Faulk</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2001">Eddie George</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Madden NFL 25 Cover Reveal</h3></div></output><p>"To be on the cover of Madden NFL is a career achievement and an honor I share with all of my teammates, coaches and 49er Faithful who have helped make it possible," McCaffrey commented. "I'm pumped to get back on the field this year to give Madden players more reasons to keep scoring touchdowns with me in Madden NFL 25."</p><p>McCaffrey is one of the most recognizable stars in the NFL and one of the best running backs in the league right now. Last season, McCaffrey not only led the league in rushing with 2,023 scrimmage yards, but had the most touches with a total of 339 and the most combined rushing and receiving touchdowns with 21 for the year. In addition, McCaffrey tied a league record of scoring a touchdown in 17 straight games.</p><p>Due to his performance last season, McCaffrey won Offensive Player of the Year and was a finalist for the NFL MVP. In previous years, EA Sports used the cover athlete to represent the new features or changes made to Madden's gameplay. Unfortunately, EA did not reveal the new features and how McCaffrey's inclusion ties into them. </p><p>This is the first proper reveal EA has done for Madden NFL 25 after reliable video game leaker and data miner Billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a report</a> about when this year's game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25s-release-date-leaked">would release</a>. The report also alleged several updated features to various game modes, including Career and Franchise.</p><p>Madden NFL 25 is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">now available for pre-order</a>. Those who buy the $100 Deluxe Edition get access to Madden NFL 25 three days early. Those planning to buy Madden NFL 25 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/college-football-25">College Football 25</a> this year could also buy the MVP Bundle, which retails for $150 and includes the Deluxe Editions for both games. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>Video games should be upfront and honest with the player, but sometimes they have to mislead you a little bit. Case in point: according to a recent <a href="https://x.com/EbengerJohn/status/1799810812347117772" rel="nofollow ">social media post</a> from designer John Ebenger, if you tried to sprint in the Citadel in Mass Effect 1, you weren't actually moving any faster: the camera field of view (FOV) simply changed to give you a sense of speed rather than the real thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebenger served as a designer at BioWare on both Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and now currently works as a cinematic director at Firewalk Studios, which is working on the recently-revealed hero shooter Concord. Ebenger says Shepherd's turtle-like gait was due to technical limitations: the game simply couldn't stream in assets fast enough on the older consoles. Given how the original Mass Effect famously used elevators to hide its load times, this makes sense. The more you know.</p>

According to Twitter/X user <a href="https://x.com/dyingnome/status/1799571133567500510" rel="nofollow ">@dyingnome</a>, an anonymous Dragon Age: Inquisition developer once told her that the mounts didn't actually move faster when they sprinted, instead using some "wind lines" to give the illusion of speed. Who knows where else BioWare used dastardly tricks like this to mislead players. All for the good of the game, of course.</p><p dir="ltr">In other BioWare news, the studio recently showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-shows-off-stylish-combat-hard-choices-and-unique-art-direction/1100-6524161/" data-ref-id="1100-6524161">20 minutes of gameplay</a> of the next Dragon Age game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-gets-a-new-title-gameplay-reveal-coming-soon/1100-6523992/">The Veilguard</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Teaming up with everyone's favorite dwarven archer, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Varric_Tethras" rel="nofollow ">Varric</a>, lovable former Inquisition scout <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Lace_Harding" rel="nofollow ">Harding</a>, and Minrathous' resident mage-slash-detective, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Neve_Gallus" rel="nofollow ">Neve Gallus</a>, Rook hacks-and-slashes his way through the various demons that have begun slipping through the Veil. At a glance, Veilguard's third-person combat looks smooth and satisfying, and gives players the choice to attack in real-time or pull up a combat wheel, pausing time while they decide which power they want to make use of. Players can choose to be a rogue, a mage, or a warrior, and each class has its own skill tree featuring useful perks and combat abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">After fighting off a Pride Demon, Rook and his fellow Veilguards get within sight of Solas, who's slightly distracted by the whole tearing-a-hole-in-reality thing. Varric decides now would be a great time for a chat, directing Rook, Harding, and Neve to hold off the demons while Varric pleads with Solas to rethink his methods. Unfortunately, his attempt at getting the elven god to see reason goes awry, and Solas zaps Varric's crossbow with a blast of magic, shattering it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294"></a><figcaption>As with every Dragon Age game, The Veilguard forces players to make difficult decisions, though The Veilguard seems to give players some extra context.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Realizing things have gone sideways, Rook decides it's time for some hands-on diplomacy and opts to knock over one of several massive elven statues, hoping to create a domino effect that will interrupt the ritual. But first, he has a decision to make: Should he bring Harding with him, or Neve? An option wheel appears on-screen, and Rook decides to take Harding with him (earning some approval from her in the process) while Neve stays back to keep the demon attacks under control. Interestingly, the wheel provides some extra information about the choice, revealing that Neve is more likely to follow the player into serious danger.</p><p dir="ltr">With Harding's help, the statues are toppled, and Solas is nearly crushed by one of them. This seems to interrupt the ritual, but it's not clear if it's actually been stopped, as a massive tear in the Veil appears and two imposing, monstrous figures step through it. Even Solas looks a little concerned, but the trailer ends before more information about these creatures is divulged.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release sometime this fall.

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We have finally seen a decent chunk of gameplay for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. Developer BioWare has published a full 20-minute video detailing some beautiful locations, an encounter with Solas, and the tragic loss of Bianca in what seems like a very early part of the game. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">The video shows the player character following Varric as they move through a city in turmoil. Their plan is to prevent Solas from tearing down the Veil and opening up a hole to the Fade. This would allow demons to pour into the world, though many of them are already present and attacking the party as they collect more characters moving through the city. It’s the heartbreaking encounter with Solas that’s so impactful here, though. Poor Bianca never saw it coming. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dragon-age-the-veilguard-s-gameplay-shows-off-varric-and-solas-explosive-encounter" data-injectable="false"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>‘s gameplay shows off Varric and Solas’ explosive encounter</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="false">Bianca is Varric’s beloved crossbow. Ever since his introduction in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, she’s been a staple weapon for him. Capable of shooting dozens of arrows at once, she could make short work of any enemies. Now, though, as we see in the video above, she’s been ripped apart by Solas in a fit of rage when the two friends shared a moment, and Varric pleased with him not to tear the Veil. </p>

<p data-characters="318" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Even though it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg03d8C5XkQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the very earliest showcases of Nvidia’s RTX lineup </a>of graphics cards <em>way</em> back in 2019, <em>Atomic Heart</em> hasn’t officially supported ray tracing proper. It’s been a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/atomic-heart-puts-its-ray-traced-beauty-on-full-display-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good looking game</a>, to be sure, but ray-traced it wasn’t. Unless you’ve got the latest update, that is.</p> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Indeed, <em>Atomic Heart</em> has finally received a proper set of ray tracing graphic settings for players to peruse, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-destructoid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost a year and a half after its initial release</a> on PC. The update – patch 1.14.4.0 – is fairly exciting in a few different ways, mind, as it comes with a surprisingly comprehensive array of accessibility features <em>and</em> a set of new Steam achievements for one of the game’s DLCs, but ray-traced graphics are definitely the belle of the bunch. Just note that they’re currently still in public beta, as it were.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mundfish</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-atomic-heart-s-ray-tracing-support-is-now-in-beta" data-injectable="false">Atomic Heart’s ray tracing support is now in beta</h2> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Upon installing the 1.14.4.0 version of <em>Atomic Heart</em> on PC, you’ll be greeted with an all-new ‘Ray Tracing’ graphics setting in the menu. This beta version of the option allows you to set ray tracing to Performance, Quality, or Balance mode depending on your hardware and preference, which will elevate the game’s visual fidelity a few notches beyond its already impressive baseline.</p>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">This, of course, comes with a hefty performance malus. Further, you’ll also need a DXR-enabled graphics card with <em>at least</em> 12 GB of VRAM for ray tracing to work properly in <em>Atomic Heart</em>. This is a tad funny in hindsight, of course, as even though <em>Atomic Heart</em> was initially demoed on the now-humble RTX 2000 series of Nvidia graphics cards, it’s clear that the game’s current ray-traced graphics are still going to push even the latest RT-ready GPUs to the max.</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">If you’re uninterested in ray tracing for whatever reason, <em>Atomic Heart</em>‘s new suite of accessibility settings might prove more meaningful to you. The new update allows you to tweak all of the following settings however you wish:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li>Quick-time event auto-completion</li> <li>Colorblind mode (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia)</li> <li>Special contrast mode</li> <li>Black and white mode</li> <li>Environmental object highlights</li> <li>Camera shake settings</li> <li>Puzzle auto-solving</li> <li>Auto-healing</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false">Not bad, right? Patch 1.14.4.0 is now available for all PC players of <em>Atomic Heart </em>on PC, so give it a whirl.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arcanes-second-season-will-be-its-last-says-its-first-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>Arriving on Netflix this November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've never played League Of Legends and I have no interest in doing so, but Arcane was superb. Set within the world of Riot's MOBA and starring several of its playable characters, Netflix's mini series was better animated and better written than any of its peers.
</p>
<p>A second season is on the way and due to arrive this November. Its teaser trailer also refers to it as "the final chapter".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Probably don't watch this if you didn't see the first season:
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Arcane: Season 2 | Official Teaser | Netflix" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Arcane season two teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEbfiLaOdJA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>That its the final season is good news, right? I loved the first season of Arcane, but good stories have endings. 
</p>
<p>I might need to go re-watch the first season between now and November, because I've forgotten a lot of the details since the first season launched in 2021. Even I can tell its picking up the major plot threads from the original's ending, with several recurring characters - which is why you shouldn't have watched the above trailer if you didn't see season one.
</p>
<p>Arcane is the work of French animation studio Fortiche, who aside from Arcane also worked on K/DA music videos and game trailers for Riot. Riot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-buy-big-part-of-arcane-animation-studio">bought a substantital stake in the company in 2022</a>, which suggests Arcane might not be their last League Of Legends-themed animation project. Or maybe next time it'll be a Valorant series, who knows.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Won’t Actually Take Up Over 300 GB of Storage Promises Activision]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-won%E2%80%99t-actually-take-up-over-300-gb-of-storage-promises-activision.898326/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-does-not-take-up-over-300-gb-storage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty franchise has become rather notorious in recent years for gobbling up unreasonable amounts of storage, which is particularly frustrating on current-gen consoles with limited SSD space. So yeah, most people were expecting <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> to be a big game, and yet, many were still shocked when the game’s pre-order pages indicated the game will require a <em>310 GB install</em>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops69.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Say whaaaat? Thankfully, the <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1720119892697821399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty X account</a> has since popped up to reassure players that the Black Ops 6 install won’t be <em>that</em> unreasonable. That 310 GB is for somebody who installs Call of Duty HQ, which is the launcher required for all recent CoD titles, along with CoD Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and all DLC for those games. While you can’t get away from installing Call of Duty HQ, obviously you don’t need to install Warzone or any of the other games to play Black Ops 6.</p>
<p><em>“Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</em></p>
<p><em>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone and all relevant content packs, including all localized languages combined which is not representative of a typical player install experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Players will be able to download Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at launch without downloading any other Call of Duty titles or all of the language packs . The actual estimation of the Black Ops 6 file size will be available closer to launch.”</em></p>
<p>As for how big Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will actually be, that remains to be seen, but Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and III “only” require about 150 GB apiece to play if you strip them right down and don’t install Warzone, DLC, other games, ect. Interestingly, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will also be utilizing cloud-based texture streaming, which means the game is always online, but perhaps that might also keep the game’s file size somewhat in check.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC (via Steam, Battle.net, and Microsoft Store), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on October 25. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-omnimovement-campaign-zombies-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get more details on the game here</a>.</p>

This will also include the chance to recreate their protagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, who will appear in <em>The Veilguard</em>, though you’ll be controlling Rook, a new protagonist for this game.</p><p>“What’s not lost on us is that it’s been 10 years since existing players have played,” Busche told <em>IGN</em>. “They might not remember [what they did in previous games]...They might need that refresher and we don’t want new players to feel like they’re missing out on those decisions. So in the character creator, I like to call it ‘Last Time on <em>Dragon Age</em>,’ but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make.”</p><p>Busche explained the decision was made to not import save data this time around because “technology is so different and [BioWare] wanted it to be in the client.” That makes sense given <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>is 10 years old and was played on old hardware. I’d also be surprised if a lot of those decisions tracked by Keep will factor into <em>The Veilguard</em>. So maybe as novel as it was, it’s just simpler to give players a menu to pick the decisions that will play into things rather than importing <em>everything</em>.</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall, and takes a notably more action-oriented approach with combat than the series has ever had.

Now in full production, senior members of the development team spoke about their goals for the remake.</p><p>One of the first challenges was finding the right balance between being faithful to the original game and modernizing it. According to creative director Bio Jade Adam Granger, there was a fine line between keeping "the original recipe" intact and tweaking other parts of the experience.</p>

<p>"We have things that are staying as-is, like the wall run, which is so iconic that we will try to match it as much as we can," Granger said in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/5bpvgE64gxlTtkBULl98XT" rel="nofollow ">Ubisoft blog post</a>. "The dagger as well. There are core elements of the original recipe that we respect and sanctify: time powers, the tone of the game, and the gravity-defying gameplay. But we modernize stuff like the level design, for example, and really enhance the scale of the world."</p><p>Game director Michael McIntyre added that combat has also been reworked, but signature moves like the overhead vault strike and rolling attacks have been kept so that players still feel like an acrobatic hero.</p><p>Addressing the lengthy development cycle--the project was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">first revealed during the 2020 Ubisoft Forward Showcase</a>--Granger explained that "the landscape of remakes has evolved a lot" in the years since Sands of Time was first announced and that the bar had been raised. Big changes to the characters, camera, and controls have been made, and Ubisoft Montreal had to build prototypes to fine-tune the gameplay further.</p><p>"It takes time and craftsmanship and people, which is why we have reinforcements from other studios to help us here," Granger said.</p><p>While the story will remain the same, McIntyre says players will get to experience more interactions between the Prince and companion, Princess Farah. "Probably the biggest development that we've done is to make Farah more present," McIntyre said. We're able to add more interactions between her and the Prince, so you can get more from their relationship. They will simply spend more time beside each other.</p><p>This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Prince of Persia franchise, and Ubisoft is celebrating with new content for two of its recent releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has more DLC on the way and it will receive its first expansion, Mask of Darkness, in September. Currently in early access on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" data-ref-id="5000-625410">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>'s first big update adds a new biome to explore, more weapons to master, and deadlier enemies to try them out on.</p>

        <p>Nearly 250 employees at risk</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sumo Group has announced it is seeking to cut costs with up to 15%, or nearly 250, of its employees at risk.</p>
<p>The firm says it hasn't been immune to the challenges facing the games industry and needs to reshape its organisation to 'navigate upcoming challenges'.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its work-for-hire and co-development services, and has built games for the likes of PlayStation, Microsoft and Sega. It also has an indie publishing team called Secret Mode. The firm has offices across Europe, India and Canada.</p>
<p>It was acquired by Tencent<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-high-court-approves-tencents-sumo-acquisition"> in a $1.27 million deal in January 2022.</a></p>
<p>The firm said in a statement: "Every day the incredibly talented people across Sumo studios are dedicated to creating great games and bringing ground-breaking experiences to players worldwide. That work and dedication over the past 21 years has helped to put Sumo on the map and build a family of studios that are second to none, and we are incredibly proud of what Sumo has become.</p>
<p>"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>
<p>"The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>
<p>"This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future."</p>
<p>Sumo Group has developed games including the BAFTA-winning Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Crackdown 3, and supported the development of games such as Team Sonic Racing, Forza Horizon and Hogwarts Legacy. It also develops its own internal projects, including Snake Pass and the upcoming Still Wakes The Deep.</p>
