                <p dir="ltr">Season 6 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> includes Call of Duty's annual The Haunting event, and the spooky theme brings one of the battle royale's most interesting limited-time modes. Purgatory isn't your typical Warzone experience, but it's a fun sandbox-style mode that feels like the perfect send-off for this final season of Modern Warfare 3. It's also a refreshingly chill mode that should stick around long-term.</p><p dir="ltr">Purgatory is played with 10 squads of four battling on Season 6's Hellspawn variant of Rebirth Island. The map's hellish makeover includes an eerie sky, blood-red water, zombified NPC creatures, and flesh-covered walls, providing enough atmospheric changes here to get you in the Halloween spirit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first glance, it's unclear what you're supposed to do with your time in Purgatory. This is a sandbox mode with custom loadouts and infinite respawns, so there's no real objective dictating how you play. This makes the mode great to play with friends while just chatting and completing challenges. Purgatory is perfect for finishing up your camo grind, completing daily or weekly challenges, or knocking out the seasonal Warzone Rewards objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Purgatory also introduces some weird mechanics to Warzone that sound completely outlandish, but they all add to the unique character of the mode. There are mystical ball-shaped portals that you can use to teleport around the map, and giant killer balls called "Terriballs" that bounce around and you can shoot at enemies, causing the ball to smash into opponents and down them.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shipment multiplayer map floats as an island above Purgatory, and you can not only land on the island and fight opponents, but you can also drive the island. Yes, you literally pilot the Shipment map around the sky like a helicopter. This is as silly as it sounds, but it's a lot of fun to take control of the island and cruise around looking for fights. Plus, it's hilarious to see someone making Shipment do loop-de-loops in the sky.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372044" data-ratio="0.56237218813906" data-width="2445" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372044"></a><figcaption>Purgatory's flying Shipment</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372044-purgatoryflyingshipment.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This mishmash of new mechanics makes for a lot of quirky fun , like the awkward moment when you realize both you and an enemy are chasing after the same Terriball. It becomes a panicked scramble to make sure you're not the one knocked out by the bouncing Terriball. Of course, some matches of Purgatory are still sweaty, with a lobby of players just hunting you down for kills, but others feature welcomed comradery as some players use the in-game chat feature to team up and help each other complete challenges. You can quietly and casually play much of a match without too much heat on you, but you also have the option to play more aggressively and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-purgatory-island-event-challenges-all-rewards-and-how-to-complete/2900-5788/">build up a high Torment level</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Torment level is shown below the minimap as a meter with five skulls, and the more kills you rack up, the higher the meter goes with a rating of 1-5 skulls. You earn more XP as your Torment level increases, but it also elevates the match difficulty. For example, reaching Torment Level 5 marks you on the map for all your opponents, and it sends an attack chopper to hunt you down. You can also lose your entire Torment level by dying or entering a safe zone, so this can be an intentional or unintentional loss of heat on the map. Again, just another welcomed mechanic that can shake things up and allow you to go for extra XP, but there's no pressure to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">The hardest part of Purgatory might just be convincing your friends to play a full match. One of my biggest gripes about the mode is Purgatory's two-hour match timer. This makes it longer than a Zombies or DMZ match, yet you don't have a way to exfil and bow out early. On the positive side, leaving early doesn't seem to tax you with any penalties. There's usually a warning for attempting to leave a standard Call of Duty match early, reminding you that you'll sacrifice the match XP if you exit early. I didn't get that warning when I needed to leave a match of Purgatory, which is nice because two hours is a lot of time to commit to one match of Call of Duty.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372045" data-ratio="0.562574970012" data-width="2501" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372045"></a><figcaption>Purgatory's Terriballs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4372045-purgatoryterriballs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The mode would feel more satisfying if you could exfil early or have an optional game-ending objective. If you stay the full time, the map just gets nuked and there are no winners declared or additional rewards offered. It just ends.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's worth noting that players are reporting some games are ending with a nuke animation before the match timer ends. I've not experienced this in any of my matches, and there doesn't seem to be any hidden nuke challenge discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Another minor complaint is that all of the contracts on the map are just the standard Warzone variety. It would've been nice to see something Halloween-themed or outside of the normal contracts added in like zombie-killing contracts or something of a spooky nature. Even a special bounty contract similar to the HVT contracts in Zombies mode, which require you to take out a special zombie type. It feels like a missed opportunity not to have Mangler, Mimics, and Disciple enemies from Zombies appear in Warzone. Even Zombies' giant Abomination enemy would be cool to see lurking around on Rebirth Island.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the flaws, I've spent a great deal of time racking up XP in Purgatory since Season 6 launched, and it makes me think a sandbox mode would be great to stick around, or at the very least, exist as a recurring mode. Call of Duty features an abundance of events and challenges that aren't always easy to grind in Warzone, especially in the normal sweaty playlists with limited respawns, and this would serve as a great option for those who don't own the yearly Call of Duty releases. It doesn't even have to remain on the spooky Hellspawn variant of Rebirth Island--Warzone's larger Urzikstan map would also be great to host a larger sandbox-style experience and seasonal events.</p><p dir="ltr">The Haunting event runs until October 16, and I highly recommend this mode for anyone looking for a spooky, fun way to level up and finish up any challenges before Season 6 ends. And while there's no real winning in Purgatory, you do have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-purgatory-island-event-challenges-all-rewards-and-how-to-complete/2900-5788/#1">Purgatory Island event themed rewards to earn</a> in the process, including some really sweet-looking animated weapon camos.</p><p>This is the final season of Modern Warfare 3 as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> arrives on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous-2">Blasphemous 2</a> - developer The Game Kitchen's acclaimed Souls-like action-platformer sequel - is delving further into the mythology of The Penitent One on 31st October, when its paid Mea Culpa expansion and an accompanying free update arrives for all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Mea Culpa tells the story of the eponymous lost sword, wielded by The Penitent One in The Game Kitchen's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> game. It promises two new zones featuring "harsh winds", "towering heights", and two new bosses. That's alongside four new quests - in which players piece together their sword - as well as new NPCs, prayers, rosary beads, Argent board figures, and an alternate ending. It also includes a "new (yet familiar) weapon and ability" - no prizes for guessing what'll be - plus new achievements.
</p>
<p>
Blasphemous 2's Mea Culpa expansion launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879370/Blasphemous_2__Mea_Culpa/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/blasphemous_2_mea_culpa">GOG</a>, and the Epic Games Store) on 31st October. It'll cost £11.99/€11.99/$11.99 USD, but there's a 20 percent discount if you pick it up in its first two weeks of release.

<p>
Mea Culpa arrives alongside a big free Blasphemous 2 content update for all players that The Game Kitchen is calling True Torment. There's a lot going on here, starting with expanded versions of existing zones. Choir of Thorns, Sunken Cathedral, and Basilica of Ancient Faces have all been "reforged" with new challenges, and the developer is introducing new connecting zones for quicker traversal between key areas.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, True Torment adds a new Labyrinth of Tides challenge, new enemies, a New Game+ mode (including "totally adjustable difficulty options"), as well as new Penitent One upgrades, quality of life improvements, and achievements. So to recap: all that arrives for free on 31st October, alongside Blasphemous 2's paid Mea Culpa expansion.

<p>Activision and Treyarch were paying attention to everyone’s feedback during the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, jotting down fixes for multiplayer maps, spawns, performance, weapons, movement, and more on the road to the game’s launch. Here’s an overview of everything they intend to improve upon for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer following beta feedback!</p>



<p>In preparation for next month’s release, Treyarch’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-mp-road-to-launch#more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest blog post</a> unveils how they’re improving the core multiplayer experience for competitive players.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p>You likely noticed that the multiplayer beta only featured a small handful of small-size maps, which made for chaotic matches. In the full launch, most of the maps will be slightly bigger—medium size—and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault</li>



<li>Protocol</li>



<li>Lowtown</li>



<li>Red Card</li>



<li>Vorkuta</li>



<li>Subsonic</li>



<li>Payback</li>



<li>Warhead</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-spawns">Spawns</h3>



<p>After spending tens of hours playing the multiplayer beta apiece, one of our biggest complaints was the spawn mechanics. They were too chaotic, too close. According to Treyarch, a core reason for the beta was to delve into the spawn system and gather data, which helped. They found that spawn logic required improvements and implemented changes to make it better.</p>



<h3 id="h-game-performance">Game Performance</h3>



<p>The whole point of a beta is to uncover bugs and performance issues. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 featured a few, and Treyarch found and squashed them. These include script errors, user interface issues, asset streaming glitches, and “hitching,” all of which they fixed for launch day.</p>







<h3 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h3>



<p>Regarding the game’s weapons, which felt impactful on day one of the beta, Treyarch is fixing a few key areas:</p>



<ul>
<li>Headshot damage is significantly improving, with location multipliers playing a pivotal role in time to kill.</li>



<li>Bullet penetration will improve before release, reducing the damage bullets deal after passing through surfaces.</li>



<li>Improvements to sniper DS</li>



<li>Better fluidity when swapping weapons</li>



<li>Reduced weapon motion during crouch animations</li>



<li>Target adjustments to shotguns and SMGs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-movement">Movement</h3>



<p>Activision and Treyarch touted the reimagined movement system as a highlight of Black Ops 6’s multiplayer gameplay, and while it felt fluid and frantic, it left something to be desired. Before launch, they intend to touch upon:</p>



<ul>
<li>Animation fluidity and fidelity</li>



<li>Adjustments to slide mechanics</li>



<li>Intelligent Movement updates</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-other-notable-changes-to-black-ops-6-multiplayer">Other Notable Changes to Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</h3>



<p>While those key areas will see significant updates before launch day, that’s not the only way Treyarch intends to improve the core experience!</p>



<ul>
<li>Shortened time in the Winner’s Circle</li>



<li>Kill Counter added to the HUD</li>



<li>Reducing camera motion while sprinting and sliding</li>



<li>Improvements to the Kill Order game mode</li>



<li>Equipment and Perk tweaks</li>
</ul>

But while you’ve typically had to buy specific keyboards (or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9edtQJaISko">set up null binds</a>) to get this functionality, Razer has <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/snap-tap-available-on-razer-blade-more-keyboards/">just brought it</a> to <em>years</em> of keyboards and laptops as well.</p><p>Every Razer keyboard and Blade laptop that works with the company’s Synapse 4 desktop software — <a href="https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6120/~/razer-synapse-4-supported-devices?_ga=2.55002408.2006252788.1727199777-367611044.1727199777">here’s the full list</a>, including laptops that go back to 2018 — can now update Synapse and toggle on Razer’s Snap Tap feature. (Other manufacturers call it “Snappy Tappy” or “Speed Tap,” and Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions, or SOCD, is the generic term.)</p><p>Razer notes that Snap Tap may not be as effective with <em>just any</em> Razer laptop or desktop keyboard. It’s best in combination with magnetic Hall effect switches that can actuate rapidly to begin with, or other Rapid Trigger-style ones, instead of switches that wait to detect a full physical press. </p><div><p>So, should you do this? Your answer depends on whether you’re willing to risk getting banned from games for what many consider cheating — including Valve, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">which is preventing players who use these features from playing <em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>. You also might want to ask whether you’re <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-cheated-not-only-the-game-but-yourself">cheating not only the game but yourself</a>.</p></div><p>Personally, I will keep it off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Considering the first movie was the kind of film that college-age (male) cinephiles tout as one of their faves, and that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_folie_a_deux&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_folie_a_deux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews for the sequel (which is also a musical) have been less-than-stellar</a></span>, I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that Gaga’s upcoming album, titled <em>Harlequin</em>, will be the best thing to come out of this movie. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Lady Gaga had been teasing <em>something </em>on social media over the last few days, sharing text-based images on her Instagram account that read “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DAJe0NkS4_m/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAJe0NkS4_m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m ready for my interview</a></span>,” and “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DAMfBA2zjqj/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAMfBA2zjqj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don’t tell me what to wear</a></span>” in scribbly font. The cryptic posts sent the Little Monsters into a frenzy, especially since they’ve known the Oscar- and Grammy-winning performer recently said LG7 (or “Lady Gaga 7,” referring to her seventh studio album) wouldn’t be out until next year. </p><p>Today, September 24, she announed <em>Harlequin</em>, her seventh studio album (but likely <em>not</em> the one she was hinting will drop in 2025), which she’s calling a “companion album” to <em>Joker: Folie à Deux. </em>You can pre-order a digital copy or the very nice-looking vinyl <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shop.ladygaga.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shop.ladygaga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>. </p><p>From the tracklist, it appears the album will be a mix of covers and original music. Check it out below:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>1. Good Morning</p><p>2. Get Happy</p><p>3. Oh, When The Saints</p><p>4. World On A String</p><p>5. If My Friends Could See Me Now</p><p>6. That’s Entertainment</p><p>7. Smile</p><p>8. The Joker</p><p>9. Folie à Deux</p><p>10. Gonna Build A Mountain</p><p>11. Close To You</p><p>12. Happy Mistake</p><p>13. That’s Life</p></blockquote><p>For example, “World On A String” and “That’s Life” are references to/the exact names of iconic Frank Sinatra songs, “Oh When The Saints” is a shortening of the title of a Louis Armstrong tune, and “That’s Entertainment” is the name of a track written for the 1952 musical <em>The Band Wagon</em>. I have a feeling a lot of these songs are going to sound like showtunes, based on the trailers we’ve seen for the upcoming film, and Gaga’s penchant for old-school Hollywood songs and jazz (she’s done two albums of covers with icon Tony Bennet). </p><p>I could listen to Lady Gaga sing the damn phone book, and combine that with the really cool album art, which shows her standing in a shower, makeup running down her face, wearing a life vest, consider me sat. I don’t even need to see the movie, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@yahooentertainment/video/7029040588079058223?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yahooentertainment/video/7029040588079058223?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I believe in the empowerment of women</a></span>, and I will be buying this album.

It's in development for PC. Check out the first trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p>Relay describes how they're aiming to set their game apart: "Gravity Forge offers the player an extra degree of freedom in both movement and combat. The environment becomes a weapon. You can walk on walls, create gravity wells, change properties of the environment (gravity, size, mass), and discover new ways to interact with the world. This is a spatial shooter, spatial imagination is your best weapon."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Gravity Forge - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here's how they describe what they're going for with combat: "Imagine the Prince of Persia with a machine gun. Or Doomguy with a katana and the fluid fast movement of a Warframe. Combine that with the cinematic flair of bullet-time action from Max Payne and you will get an idea of how Gravity Forge plays."</p><p>Gravity Forge is set in the dieselpunk city of Gaston City, where you play as Elsa, a treasure-hunter whose big heist goes bad, leaving her to deal with the consequences of the "Living Magnet" technology she's unleashed. </p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2848760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Gravity Forge on Steam if you're interested in following its progress.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There are two big story beats revealed in the trailer. The first revolves around the Cathedral of Light, which has fractured after the death of Inarius at the end of the base game. Now, a new militant sect called the Burnt Knights is looking to take control, and they don't seem particularly friendly. In the trailer we see a new character, the Burnt Knight leader Urivar, getting ready to execute someone as his adoring followers cheer him on. It certainly seems like Urivar could be a potential boss fight in the expansion, as the knights blame Neyrelle, Lorath, and the player character for the Cathedral of Light's defeat in hell and are hunting them down.</p><p dir="ltr">With Inarius dead, it's unclear if the Burnt Knights have a new angel to look towards for guidance, but there is some evidence that players may battle the forces of heaven in Vessel of Hatred. A new Mythic Unique item, <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/two-new-mythic-uniques-coming-to-diablo-4-with-vessel-of-hatred/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heir of Perdition</a>, coming in the expansion sports an affix that grants "+200% damage to angels and demons." Players haven't yet faced angels in Diablo 4, and the item seemingly confirms that players will battle both heaven and hell in the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the other story spoiler revealed in the trailer, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that players will be facing off against Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. The core story of the expansion revolves around Neyrelle, traveling with a Soul Stone containing Mephisto, as she looks to rid the world of the Prime Evil for good. All the while she is struggling to contain Mephisto's influence, as her mind becomes slowly corrupted by his malice.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer reveals what might be the game's final boss battle against Mephisto, one where he has taken the form of a massive, demonic tentacle-wolf. Whether or not this is Mephisto's final form remains to be seen. Regardless, it is a little surprising that Blizzard would spoil one of the expansion's climactic showdowns in a pre-launch trailer, even if players were already expecting to do battle with Mephisto in some form. Might that indicate Blizzard has some kind of trick up its sleeve, with Mephisto not actually serving as the expansion's final boss? It's possible, but players thankfully won't have to wait much longer to find out.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred releases October 8 and will introduce a number of new gameplay systems to the ARPG. As seen in the trailer, recruitable Mercenaries are returning, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">endgame co-op dungeon coming as part of the expansion will be the first of its kind in Diablo</a>. The expansion will additionally add a new class, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">the Spiritborn</a>, for players to play as, as well as see the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">return of Runewords from Diablo 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first Dying Light 2 DLC, Bloody Ties, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-bloody-ties-release-date-story-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in October 2022. Originally, Techland had promised two story DLCs included with the Ultimate Edition, and the second DLC was supposed to be far larger than Bloody Ties.</p>
<p>It turns out it became so large that it's now its own standalone game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beast</a>. The upside is that the aforementioned owners of Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition will get it for free once it is released. What about the future of Dying Light 2, though? Here's what Franchise Director Tymon Smektala told me at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p><em>We have promised five years of support for the game. There will be more updates coming to Dying Light 2 this year and in the next years. That's all I can say; we don't want to reveal too much right now because the message that we have right now is that Dying Light: The Beast is a new zombie adventure set in the world of Dying Light. Kyle Crane is back and we have a great game on our hands. We'll focus on this for a moment, and then we'll get back to Dying Light 2 quite soon.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Right now, we are not planning a narrative DLC for Dying Light 2, but the game will be supported and you can expect more content coming to it over the next years.</em></p>
<p>The last major content update for the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Raid Open Beta</a>. If Techland doesn't produce any more major story DLCs, the Polish studio may focus more on cooperative multiplayer content in the game's future.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the studio is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-game-new-concept-art-climbing-huge-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on an open world fantasy RPG based on a brand new IP. However, we haven't really heard any updates on this project in a year and a half.</p>

<p>Sony may have accidently leaked some of the games being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-september-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown during Tuesday’s</a> State of Play via the PlayStation Store. </p>



<p>Multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/some-of-the-state-of-play-24-09-2024-games-leaked-by-playstation-store.374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people have seen a collection</a> on the PlayStation Store titled “State of Play” with a list of a number of games that could be appearing at some point during the show.</p>



<p>According to the collection, the following games could be part of the event in some way:</p>



<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>



<li>The Last of Us Part 1</li>



<li>Stellar Blade</li>



<li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li>



<li>LEGO Horizon</li>



<li>TMNT Shredders Revenge</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Metro Awakening VR</li>



<li>Dynasty Warriors Origins</li>



<li>Fantasian Neo Dimension</li>



<li>Fear the Spotlight</li>



<li>Dragon Age The Veilguard</li>



<li>Sonic x Shadow Generations</li>



<li>Alan Wake 2</li>



<li>Hell is Us</li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, until the event actually airs it’s hard to no for sure exactly what will be appearing. There are also rumors of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remaster</a> being announced in the near future, possibly during the show. </p>



<p>The full event will feature over 20 games shown over a 30+ minute show. Based on the list of games above, even if it’s 100% accurate, there are still at least five games not shown via the store. As far as what’s on the list, one would assume that it could range from DLC announcements to release date reveals.</p>

                <p>Jason Rohrer is known for <a href="https://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/" rel="nofollow ">creating video games with some pretty off-the-wall concepts</a>, but his latest venture--a battle royale known as Project Skydrop--takes things a step further. Rohrer teamed up with friend and musician Tom Bailey to create the game, and unlike most battle royales, Rohrer's new adventure won't see players fighting to the death. There is a catch, however: Project Skydrop takes place in real life, and the winner will receive a custom-made solid gold trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">Rohrer says he's been working on Project Skydrop since 2021, and after years of planning, plotting, and acquiring a sufficiently impressive reward for the winner, the game is now afoot. The treasure--a 10.9-ounce 24-karat solid-gold trophy worth roughly $26,000--was commissioned and paid for by Rohrer himself, but according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/project-skydrop-jason-rohrer-treasure-hunt-begins/" rel="nofollow ">a profile by Wired</a>, the winner may also receive a "life-changing amount of bitcoin," with the exact number dependent upon how many players take part in the hunt.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKY53B3Y8gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EKY53B3Y8gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The game only lasts for 21 days, and at the time of writing, there are 16 days left for players to track down the prize. Rohrer has revealed that the trophy is located "somewhere in the northeastern United States," and at this point, Project Skydrop might sound like a simple (albeit extremely lucrative) treasure hunt. So what exactly makes it a battle royale?</p><p dir="ltr">Rohrer says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> inspired him to put the treasure somewhere inside an ever-shrinking circle. The circle was 500 miles wide the day the hunt began, and has been shrinking each day since. Every day, the circle grows smaller, and a map on <a href="https://projectskydrop.com/" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a> is updated to show players the size and location of that day's circle.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, each day of circle-shrinking is accompanied by a new photo of the 24 karat trophy. The photos started out as close-up shots of the prize's hiding place, but as the circle shrinks, the photos of the trophy zoom farther and farther out, giving players a more detailed view of the surrounding area each day. Based on the circle's current position, the prize is hidden somewhere in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Rohrer has sent players on a wild goose chase in exchange for some premium loot. In Fall 2021, Rohrer created Project Skydrop's precursor. With the help of his kids, Rohrer hid a chest containing $3,000 worth of silver coins in a state park near his home in Dover, Delaware. Then he slipped some clues about its location into his (computer) game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/595690/One_Hour_One_Life/" rel="nofollow ">One Hour One Life</a>. Rohrer feared the clues--which were hidden in a poem that was programmed to disappear from the game after just one day--were too cryptic, and would ultimately prove too difficult for players to solve.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4371917-skydrop%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371917" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4371917-skydrop%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371917"></a><figcaption>The game's one-of-a-kind prize is hidden somewhere in the northeastern US.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4371917-skydrop%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Eight hours later, One Hour One Life players had decoded the poem and were headed to the chest's location. Rohrer was amazed--and slightly frustrated--by the speed with which players had solved the puzzle. After the Dover chest's rapid discovery, Rohrer began working to create the "perfect" treasure hunt: one that "doesn’t last 10 years and doesn’t last one day." Thus, Project Skydrop was born.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the game's 21-day run time, Rohrer told Wired it's all about the spectacle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Three weeks is a pretty good timeline for a dramatic arc," he said of Project Skydrop's lifespan. "It seems long enough for people to feel like they have a chance, but not so long that everyone loses interest."</p><p>For more information on Rohrer's wild battle royale (including the latest updates on the shrinking circle's location) see <a href="https://projectskydrop.com/" rel="nofollow ">the official Project Skydrop website</a>, where Rohrer has set up a live video stream of the trophy to ensure the game's dramatic end is caught on camera.</p>

            <p>
Satirical Doom WAD Thatcher's Techbase has returned to Bethesda's official mod browser - now shorn of Maggie and anything else that might conceivably be deemed offensive - after initially being booted for daring to dabble in "real-world politics".
</p>
<p>
Thatcher's Techbase - which sees players descending to the Tenth Circle of Hell in order to thwart the return of "one of humanity's greatest threats" - has been around for a while, originally launching in 2021. However, when Bethesda's official community published mod support arrived for Doom in August, developer Jim Purvis opted to take advantage of it, giving console owners the chance to play the WAD for the first time.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it wasn't long before Bethesda <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-yanks-thatchers-techbase-doom-mod-from-in-game-browser">stepped in</a>, yanking Thatcher's Techbase from its browser after telling Purvis the mod had been reported for "real-world politics". Purvis was also instructed to "educate" himself on modding guidelines and community rules.

<p>
And with his education now complete, Purvis has restored the mod to Bethesda's browser in a new, passive-aggressively inoffensive form. "To celebrate its 3rd birthday," he <a href="https://x.com/letshugbro/status/1838551302017540397">wrote on social media</a>, "I am rereleasing Thatcher's Techbase for Doom 1 &amp; 2! However, in light of the recent Educational Notice received from Bethesda, all real-world politics have now been removed."
</p>
<p>
"The team here at 3D: Doom Daddy Digital has worked tirelessly to remove all references to real-world politics from Thatcher's Techbase," Purvis continued, "and create a Doom WAD that can be enjoyed by all gamers, regardless of political persuasion."
</p>
<p>
To that end, the mod, in a blaze of malicious compliance, is now known as ███████'█ Techbase, while its accompanying logo has been altered with the absolute bare-minimum of effort, its "Thatcher's" bit half-heartedly doused in a splotch of red digital paint. In-game, meanwhile, changes include tweaks to signage, with one picture of Maggie now obscured by a jolly smiling face, its caption altered from "PURE EVIL" to "PURE NICE" (the 'nice', incidentally, has been rendered in jaunty Comic Sans, immediately making this whole enterprise infinitely more offensive than the original).
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, a whole bunch of fliers have been  replaced, with one notably changed from "No pit closures" to "No politics, no religion, no drama". And perhaps best of all, an area designed to resemble the House of Commons has been gracefully robbed of its capacity to offend by removing every single one of its textures.

But that isn't quite everything. Composer Barry "Epoch" Topping (of Paradise Killer fame, among other things) has also reworked the soundtrack for ███████'█ Techbase "to ensure no politically-motivated rhythms can be heard by players". Now, as you're descending into hell to confront whoever the milk snatcher has been replaced with, you can enjoy a <a href="https://x.com/letshugbro/status/1838552884775907338">more uplifting version</a> of the soundtrack, played in a major rather than minor key.
</p>
<p>
███████'█ Techbase is available to download right now via Bethesda's official Doom mod browser, but if you really must sully yourself with all that "politics", the original version <a href="https://t.co/y3abUSFRBF">remains available</a> to play on PC through the usual, non-Bethesda channels.

			<p>Yesterday, a dev diary showcasing Assassin's Creed Shadows went<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-assassins-creed-shadows-dev-diary-featuring-gameplay-leaks-online/"> live on the IGN China website</a>. Since then, <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft has announced</a> that they are canceling their appearance at the Tokyo Game Show, which was due to take place from September 26 to September 29. In addition, Ubisoft has also canceled press previews of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows press previews were reportedly due to take place next week, with the embargo date being released during that time. However, they have since been canceled. It's not been confirmed as to why the press previews have been canceled, but it's a safe guess that it has something to do with the various leaks of Assassin's Creed Shadows appearing online, and the huge controversy that has gone along with them.</p>
<p>Regarding their appearance at the Tokyo Game Show, they've cited their reason as "various circumstances," which is a very broad and vague response as to why they are no longer showcasing at the exhibition. In addition to their appearance as an exhibitor at the Tokyo Game Show, they've also canceled the stream that was scheduled for September 26. Again, the reasons haven't been stated, but it's possible that it's due to the significant amount of criticism Assassin's Creed Shadows has been facing, with complaints citing that the game is an inaccurate representation of Japanese history and culture.</p>
<p>While the game is still expected to have a preview event at the end of September, it's unsure as to whether there will be any event showcasing the game at all this month. Ubisoft has had a rocky year financially, with their <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">share prices dropping significantly</a> and their revenue taking a huge hit with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and XDefiant not quite performing the way they were hoping.</p>
<p>Additionally, their shareholders are pushing for them to restructure the company, and to hire a new CEO, which, so far, the changes have not happened. Whether they will go ahead remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Although they are no longer doing the live stream showcasing the game, Ubisoft has stated that the ongoing giveaway campaign will continue despite the fact that the broadcast is no longer going ahead.</p>
<p>There is already huge speculation as to whether Assassin's Creed Shadows will be delayed with all of the ongoing controversy and peculiar cancelations, but now it seems even more likely after they pulled out of the biggest Tokyo Game Show to date. Whether it will be severely delayed or it will just be a couple of weeks or months, remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/try-the-demo-for-top-down-undead-slayer-moon-watch-in-which-time-is-movement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A week ago, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/among-the-many-beauties-of-arco-is-that-its-a-secret-gentle-introduction-to-bullet-hell-shooting">belabouring the nuances of Arco</a>, I expressed a wish to play more bullet hell games with time freeze mechanics, the better to savour the intricacy of their projectile patterning. Now here's Moon Watch, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-ish pixelart shooter in which you have a watch that stops time when you stand still. Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.</p>

<p>At least, until you run out of energy for garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets. In a sadistic reversal of the premise - akin to offering a child a spoonful of pudding, only to swap it for a spoonful of disgusting, nutritious vegetables - energy for weapons must be restored by moving about. So when you're not laughing in the faces of the living dead, you'll be carefully kiting them and dodging their shrapnel, with one eye glued to the energy reservoirs in the bottom left.</p>
<p>Why is Moon Watch "Vampire Survivors-ish", rather than "Vampire Survivors-like"? Well, firstly because many of the abilities have to be manually aimed and fired using the mouse. And secondly, because the game is made up of distinct levels or arenas sprinkled across a roguelitey campaign path. Each arena asks you to hold out for a certain time, rather than being a continuous, upward spiral of enemy waves and unlockables - it's a bit reminiscent of Into The Breach, I guess.</p>
<p>The vampire swarms aside, similarities with Vampire Survivors include a choice of three unlocks when you level up. These are the usual mix of passive buffs and new weapons for your hand. You can get turrets, for instance, and throwable zombie bait, and a teleport dash. I'm sure you can figure out some way to combine these things.</p>
<p>What else is there to tell? Well, the starting character is some kind of warrior-nun who looks like the ogreish blonde girl from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsnJ9jlwns">Hey Arnold!</a>, but doesn't seem nearly as ogreish. When you beat a level she does a victory twirl, even as the remaining zombos mob her position like pigeons spotting a dropped sandwich. I find this charmingly plucky. Also, developers The Jaspel are the same depraved, genre-muddling scientists wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a>.</p>
<p>Find the demo for Moon Watch on <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/moonwatch">Itch.io</a> with a full release to follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/">Steam</a> at some point in the tactically deferred future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
