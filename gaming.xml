		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is no longer going to be released on September 5th, Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau have announced. Instead, the new release date will be October 31st due to a couple of reasons. The main reason is that there has been a delay in manufacturing the physical copies of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and the second is that the extended window allows for additional development of the game.</p>

<p>In a statement, Reef Entertainment wrote, <em>“Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025. Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game. We apologise, and thank you for bearing with us. This delay will also give the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself and we would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of Terminator 2D: NO FATE together. As such, this delay will apply to both physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>From the moment we announced Terminator 2D: NO FATE, the response has been absolutely amazing and truly humbling.So, to all of you, thank you so much for your support. We know that this news is disappointing and we appreciate your understanding. We are dedicated to delivering the best release possible for Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we look forward to sharing more of the game with you soon.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.</p>

<p>The very fabric of puzzling</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Thunderful Publishing and Sad Owl Games have announced that their acclaimed 2023 puzzler, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a></strong>, will be coming to Switch consoles this winter, although they haven't gone as far as to give us a specific release date.</p>
<p>You can check out the game's trailer above for a little taste of its exquisite flavours, and we can tell you that this one really is quite the get for Switch fans. It's currently sitting pretty on a whopping Metacritic score of 86, and is an effort that's wowed across the board with its clever approach to puzzling and the twisting of its players' realities.</p>

<p>Here's some further details about the game from the official press blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a BAFTA and UKIE Video Game Awards 2024 winner, <em><strong>Viewfinder</strong></em> immerses players in a mind-bending first-person puzzle adventure that brings pictures to life by placing them into the world. Players will embark on an unforgettable story that digs deeper into the ever changing world, human experience and relationships, meaningful and misguided passion for change and overcoming loss. Viewfinder is currently available on PC and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Key gameplay features include:</p>
<p><strong>Reshape Reality</strong> – Players can bring photographs, paintings, sketches, screenshots and postcards to life while reshaping the world and uncovering what the founders left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration is Learning</strong> – Players will learn the secrets of the world, the reason why it exists and the freedom to create by exploring multiple hub worlds that are all cohesive and encompass similar, but complex, differences.</p>
<p><strong>Endless Experiences</strong> – Viewfinder’s narrative is player driven, featuring an approachable experience for players who just want to solve puzzles, and a rich well thought off world for those who want to learn more</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wildgate, the PvP shooter that goes between ship-to-ship battle and boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting from Dreamhaven, a team made up of former Blizzard developers is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>The studio debuted a new trailer for the game alongside the launch, which shows off more gameplay and the Sea of Thieves-like gameplay with a sci-fi setting that Wildgate features.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wildgate | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDcX7Kf_gTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The launch also came with a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530978642895831122?l=english">development blog</a> with patch notes and changes to the game based on feedback from players who had checked it out in open beta format, ahead of the full launch. </p>



<p>The patch notes include changes to player cards, and the introduction of new methods of progression, including an Infamy System, Streaks, and Milestones. It also includes the announcement of a new game mode, changes to ship balancing like updates to the health, design, and interactions between ships. There were also weapon, equipment, and loot updates, as well as balances to the combat overall, like adjusting the respawn time to 16 seconds for dying outside your ship and 12 seconds for dying on your ship.</p>



<p>Then there were also user interface changes, quality of life updates, and of course, several bug fixes to help make the launch run smoothly.</p>



<p>"<em>The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible,</em>" said co-founder of Dreamhaven and chief executive officer Mike Morhaime, in a<a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/22/wildgate-the-crew-based-space-shooter-from-dreamhaven-and-moonshot-games-available-now/"> press release</a>. "<em>It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun. Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds</em>."</p>



<p>When<a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/"> Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Wildgate</a> earlier this year in March, he wrote "<em>The game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the game is out for everyone, hopefully it's able to live up to that promise.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/supermassive-games">Supermassive Games</a>, best known for developing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-pictures">The Dark Pictures</a> Anthology, have announced they've begun the consultation process for a round of redundancies that'll affect "up to 36" staff. As part of this, sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Directive 8020 has had its release delayed to early next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Supermassive have confirmed that the development of puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a> hasn't been affected by these job cuts, with that game still being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better">on track to come out October 10th</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the studio blamed these layoffs on a need to "better align" with the games industry being "a challenging and ever-evolving environment", whatever that means.</p>
<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected," Supermassive wrote, "We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans."</p> <div>

<p>This latest round at layoffs follow the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">laying off around 90 workers in February 2024</a>, citing similar reasoning to that which they've employed here in a social post that looked pretty similar too.</p>
<p>Directive 8020, a standalone entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020s-teaser-trailer-has-leaked">first leaked back in 2022</a>. Supermassive pencilled in a 2025 release for it as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-next-dark-pictures-horror-game-directive-2080-is-out-2025-and-looks-like-alien-meets-the-thing">a proper announcement last summer</a>, which showed off a game the very much looked like it'd be putting the phrase 'in space, no one can hear you scream' to the test. It's all about a colony ship called Cassiopeia crash landing on a planet and its crew then having further bad times as they're hunted down by an alien organism in true Xenomorphy fashion.</p>
<p>"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," reads the first line of Directive 8020's blurb, which I wish didn't vaguely feel like it unintentionally reflects the mood in the games industry right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-lay-off-up-to-36-workers-delay-interstellar-horror-directive-8020]]></content:encoded>

Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destory my soundbar and subwoofer combo that cost's nearly double the price of these.

Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup.

The cuts follow an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-developer-supermassive-games-plans-to-lay-off-around-90-workers">earlier round of redundancies in March 2024</a>, when the developer said it would shed around 90 workers in a similarly-worded statement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Supermassive previously stated it had around 350 employees as of 2023, meaning it has laid off around a third of the studio over the past 18 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026," Supermassive said. "The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A standalone entry in Supermassive's Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/supermassive-6-more-dark-pictures-anthology-games-planned">one of a list of apparently-upcoming entries in the series</a> spotted back in early 2022. The game was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-and-the-quarry-developers-next-game-is-a-sci-fi-horror">made official later that year</a>, in a trailer included at the end of The Dark Pictures: The Devil In Me.

Next up was the murder hotel-inspired The Devil in Me in 2022, before then the virtual reality spin-off Switchback VR a year later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, progress on further entries in the series appears to have slowed, with Directive 8020 now set to arrive at least three years after the franchise's previous entry, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade">positioned as a more standalone title</a>. Supermassive has said it has used the extra time to improve the franchise's gameplay, though links to previous games — such as via the mysterious recurring character of the Curator — sound like they'll be played down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Supermassive will continue working on its delayed Little Nightmares 3, currently set to launch on October 10. Development on this project is unaffected by today's layoffs, the studio has confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Rest For The Wicked Is Brutal And Ambitious, But A Little Confused | Early Access Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>In a social media post, Mahler clarified his statement further, explaining that Moon Studios is looking to eventually "ship on all platforms," and on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-be-skipping-xbox-due-to-market-conditions-update-dev-reply-added-to-op.1686511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum</a>, he mentioned that optimization for PS5 was easier in comparison to Xbox Series X|S. For a small developer like Moon Studios, this simply made more economic sense for the studio to focus on that platform, Mahler explained.</p><p>"We'll first support the platform that has the most users purely out of resource reasons," Mahler wrote. "We're a comparatively small indie studio, so doing a console port at the quality level we want is not a small task. Porting to Xbox means porting to Xbox Series X and Series S, and that'll take more time to optimize compared to porting to PS5 and PS5 Pro. So we're most likely going to do PS5 [and ] PS5 Pro first and launch there in order to make fans happy and supply other ports later. So there's nothing to see here; it's just common sense with us having to make the right moves given the resources we have while making sure we give players what they want as fast as possible."</p><p>Moon Studios wouldn't be the first developer to bring its game to PS5 first and Xbox Series X|S later, and data released last year suggested that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-has-outsold-xbox-series-x-s-2-to-1-newly-revealed-sales-data-suggests/1100-6520964/" data-ref-id="1100-6520964">PS5 may have outsold the Xbox Series X|S</a> by roughly a 2:1 margin. That divide may have increased further since then, as Sony recently confirmed that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-4-years-later-ps5-has-more-monthly-users-than-ps4/1100-6532430/" data-ref-id="1100-6532430">49 million monthly users on PS5</a> as of April 30, 2024.</p><p>Microsoft remains cagey with exact figures related to its Xbox Series X|S console, and over the last couple of months, it has adopted a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">this is an Xbox</a>" multiplatform strategy that has seen more of its formerly exclusive games released on PS5. It has also teamed up with Asus to make an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245"> Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC</a>.</p>

This limited-time event is only playable during certain times, but if you happen to catch it and play through a full set of rounds, you can earn some very valuable loot.</p><p>The Sieve is a three-person cooperative activity based in and around the Caldera, the main hub area on Kepler. It is only active for thirty minutes and then has a 1 hour and 44 minute cooldown, meaning that you'll need to be patient or lucky to hop in at the right time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4535920" data-ratio="0.56260575296108" data-width="2364" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4535920"></a><figcaption>When it goes live, you can boot into the activity from this icon on the Kepler map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg"></figure><p>If you do launch into it, you'll be matchmade with a Fireteam to take on a series of tasks oriented narratively around the Drifter's mining rig. You'll need to place beacons for Drifter to mine dark matter from around the Caldera, and your Fireteam will need to fend off waves of enemies, including difficult sabotage Minotaurs that can shut down the mining operation for an extended period of time.</p><p>If you successfully complete the mining activity, you are granted rewards and are given the opportunity to start another activity. These are usually oriented around bosses, but the type and strength of the boss varies randomly. After killing the boss, you'll get some more rewards and can start another mining rig defense run.</p><p>Fireteams can go through this back-and-forth cadence for several iterations. Occasionally, you'll get a special one-off event of banking motes (like Gambit) which appears to grant even more valuable rewards. I've reached this point once and didn't get any Exotics, but reports from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1m3dy1b/the_sieve_drops_exotics_you_dont_own/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Destiny community</a> suggest that you can get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-destiny-2-edge-of-fate-expansions-new-exotic-armor-does/1100-6532685/" data-ref-id="1100-6532685">the new Exotic armor piece for each class</a> from The Sieve--rather than the "normal" path of acquiring the armor by grinding through the Legendary campaign.</p><p>In addition to being a fun and extremely chaotic change of pace from the normal Destiny gameplay loop, The Sieve is also a required step on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-destiny-2-graviton-spike-exotic-hand-cannon/1100-6533185/" data-ref-id="1100-6533185">the Exotic questline to acquire Graviton Spike</a>. After doing the exploration steps throughout Kepler, you'll need to finish a round of The Sieve to finally nab the cool Arc-Void hand cannon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-closed-beta-september-vi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-closed-beta-coming-in-september-new-champion-vi-revealed.1250055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that its&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year, and a new champion has been announced for the roster as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-closedbeta-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, <i>2XKO</i>'s closed beta begins on September 9th, and Riot says that once the beta is online, its "goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance". That means there won't be any downtime; once you're in, you're in.</p>

<p>However, this does also mean that&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s closed beta will only be available for PC, so if you're hoping to check the game out on consoles, you'll have to wait a while, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ny8DU7MY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ijwjn5Pd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The silver lining here, however, is that&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>will support cross-progression, so if you get started in the closed beta on PC, you'll still be able to transfer whatever progress you make to your preferred version when it launches.</p>

<p>To get a chance to check out the closed beta, you can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. If you participated in either of&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s Alpha Lab tests, then you're already signed up for the closed beta and you can just wait for your confirmation email.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the closed beta, Riot also revealed a new champion for the game's roster in the form of the Piltover enforcer Vi. Given that she fights with a massive pair of gauntlets, she's pretty much a no-brainer for&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>.</p>

<p>Vi's trailer reveals her to be a powerful and fearsome combatant, and her design looks like it's somewhere in between the original&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>look and the newer&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>aesthetic. You can check out her trailer here.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;fighting game that features champions from the MOBA's roster duking it out in two-on-two combat.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" rel="nofollow">designated&nbsp;<em>Project L</em></a>, the game was subsequently renamed to&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">in February last year</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, but its PC closed beta begins on September 9th, and it's also set to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in full.</p>

            <p>If I'm interpreting the press materials for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gossamer-matrix">Gossamer Matrix</a> correctly, this is an FPS in which you might accidentally stuff a chocolate bar into your AK47 while trying to reload. The result will not be a fusillade of chocodrops. Instead, you will be gunned down like the miserable office slob you absolutely are. So keep your workspace tidy, chief.</p>
<p>I'm looking at my desk as I type these words. It contains: a piece of paper with "gel" written on it, purpose unknown; a stolen Cafe Nero mug, never cleaned; Vikram Chandra's memoir Geek Sublime; and a bag of raisins. I do not own a gun, because this is the UK and one of the UK's few advantages is that the vast majority of people don't own guns, but if I did own a six-shooter and were lured into a gunfight right now, I guarantee I'd be stuffing raisins into the chamber while choking to death on my own bullets.</p><!--more-->

<p>Which is hopefully the kind of doofiness that will make Gossamer Matrix fun. In this, gloriously non-widescreen and Haribo-coloured arcade shooter from catmilk, you are a security guard tasked with rescuing your company's board members from the invading forces of Mallow Corp. To do this you must wrangle with a "physics-based interaction scheme" that obliges you to load guns by dragging bullets onto them and yanking at their bits. All the while managing a screenful of other stuff that has minimal ballistic potential.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a clear sense of things in the absence of a demo, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002840/Gossamer_Matrix/">the Steam page</a> fills in the picture somewhat. "Things can quickly get overwhelming if you don't take the time to keep your workspace clean," it notes. "Empty magazines, candy wrappers, and dirty syringes will crowd your vision and obstruct your pockets if not disposed of properly, and being distracted on the clock is not a luxury you can afford."</p>
<p>This looks and sounds like a hoot and a holler. I now consider games with dedicated reloading buttons desperately quaint. If you're wondering where you've come across this before, it turns out Alice0 (RPS in peace) listed it as one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-101-most-anticipated-games-of-2023">most anticipated games of 2023</a>. That was before I started at RPS, mind you, a period popularly known as the "Bozo's Interval", so I feel no shame about posting the game again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-acid-bright-office-shooter-gossamer-matrix-you-have-to-reload-while-managing-a-deskful-of-junk]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> reimagines the <em>Pac-Man </em>franchise in the darkest and weirdest way you could possibly expect, but it manages to be a hell of a good time nonetheless. Whether you’re someone who loves anything starring the little yellow pellet-muncher, or just want a challenging Metroidvania to sink your teeth into, this one should be right up your alley. You’ve got quite a journey ahead, but the first few hours can be a lot to take in, so here are four tips to help you acclimate to <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196646,196215" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h572508"><a id=""></a>Take it slow and steady</h2><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is a surprisingly tough Metroidvania with a lot of traversal between checkpoints, so surviving the powerful foes and dangerous environments takes patience and precision. Take your time and consider your next move when approaching groups of enemies or hazardous obstacles. You can even move your camera around to survey the vicinity when needed. </p><figure id="" data-id="5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-recommend-id="image://5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-recommend-id="image://5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And make sure you explore each area thoroughly, too, as there are tons of well-hidden secrets to find. You’ll sometimes even find that the environment is hiding secret pathways that are only revealed when you come in contact with it. Sneaky!</p><h2 id="h572509"><a id=""></a>Always be chompin’</h2><p>One of <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>’s most unique mechanics is Devour. By pressing in on the right stick, you can pick up and eat enemies after you kill them. Doing so will fill up your GAIA meter (more on that below) and reward you with materials you can trade for useful perks (stylized as PERKs in the game). So, yeah, you’ll want to be doing this <em>constantly</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-recommend-id="image://609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-recommend-id="image://609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dead enemies will disappear if you don’t Devour them quickly, so make sure you’re consistently jamming that right stick to grab ‘em up and toss ‘em down your gullet. Luckily, you can pick up multiple dead enemies at once, making things slightly less tedious when dealing with groups. </p><h2 id="h572510"><a id=""></a>Save GAIA for bosses to make quick work of them</h2><p>As you eat enemies and fill up your GAIA meter, you can eventually transform into GAIA, allowing you to dish out huge damage while taking none yourself. You’ll occasionally need to use this to traverse through otherwise impassable environmental spots, but otherwise, I’d really recommend you save it for bosses. At least early in the game, transforming into GAIA trivializes foes that might otherwise take a while to kill. I mean, I obliterated this stupid bear boss in the picture below so quickly I didn’t really even see its moveset. </p><figure id="" data-id="e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-recommend-id="image://e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-recommend-id="image://e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And as I mentioned above, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> often has quite a bit of ground to cover to reach checkpoints. So, if you don’t want to have to make the long trek back to a boss, it’s probably best to use everything at your disposal to get past it. That being said, if you feel GAIA makes things too easy, go at it the swordfighter way. It’s your game — play it however you want.</p><h2 id="h572511"><a id=""></a>For love of god, manually control PUCK</h2><p>You’ll spend a lot of time riding D-Lines as PUCK in <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>. These segments function like on-rails Pac-Man levels, and they often require a significant amount of twitchy movement to overcome. As such, you’ll want to be sure you’re being as precise as possible and really thinking through how to handle D-Line movement.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-recommend-id="image://ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-recommend-id="image://ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By default, PUCK will automatically move in whichever direction you’ve recently faced it. You can brake by using the right trigger on your controller, but due to the constant hazards in your way during D-Line rides, I’d really recommend switching to manual control. By pressing the left bumper on your controller, you can take full control over when and how PUCK moves. It’s so much better.</p><hr><p>Now that you know to do, get PUCKin’ in <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/shadow-labyrinth-tips-pluck-manual-eat-gaia-1851786714]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Obsidian has expressed a strong interest for game preservation to Eurogamer while talking about whether Grounded 2 will usurp and replace Grounded 1 when it arrives in early access at the end of July.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview, executive producer Marcus Morgan told me: "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history." He pointed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ten-years-after-its-launch-pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-a-turn-based-combat-mode">the surprise patch Obsidian released for 10-year-old isometric role-playing game Pillars of Eternity</a>, earlier this year, as proof. "There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved," he said.</p>
<p>"Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1?" he added. "No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released our [update] 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up; it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well.</p>
<p>"But we are, in terms of where we're moving the story, where we're expanding things: if you want more Grounded, we'll be more into Grounded 2 versus Grounded 1. We're pushing things forward with Grounded 2."</p>

<p>Morgan's comments reference a bigger problem games face where if their servers are taken offline, they effectively cease to exist. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">EA recently announced it would switch the Anthem servers off</a>, for example, and when that happens, no one will be able to play the game. Anthem will, for all intents and purposes, disappear.</p>
<p>It's become such a problem that an anti-closure movement has sprung up in response, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">Stop Killing Games</a>, and its petition has amassed hundreds of thousands, potentially more than a million, signatures of support. It seeks to ensure publishers leave their games in a playable state after official support is pulled.</p>
<p>Grounded theoretically falls into the at-risk category by being multiplayer, it being built on the idea of co-operative survival in a back garden world, as an inch-high teenager. But there's a crucial difference that potentially future-proofs it.</p>

<p>Morgan explained: "One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>"And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that," he added. "More to say it does establish [Grounded 1] so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases in early access on 29th July. The sequel introduces mounts and moves the action from a backyard world into a larger space called Brookhollow Park, introducing new biomes, deeper systems and gameplay with it. I'm currently playing the sequel but can't say anything more until the day it comes out. Pop back then.</p>

			<p>The Pokémon Company hosted a Pokémon Presents event today, which had a slew of announcements, including a new mobile game called Pokémon Friends that's out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 and mobile devices, a 2026 release window for Pokémon Champions, and a new story trailer for the highly-anticipated Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new game that was announced, Pokémon Friends is a new puzzle game that can be played on iOS and Android mobile devices, or on your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 system. It's a puzzle game that includes 2D and 3D puzzles, all in the service of creating your own plush room that you can stuff to the brim with Pokémon paraphernalia. </p>



<p>"<em>Solve puzzles and get your daily 'aha' moment,</em>" the trailer proclaims, as Pokémon Friends is seemingly the latest in The Pokémon Company's line of mobile games it wants people checking in on daily, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sms37W1x3-M">Pokémon TCG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbW585_nTj0">Pokémon Sleep</a>. And speaking of those mobile games, there were also announcements for the above two, along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4YBHig-wfA">Pokémon GO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLBCN7LsQkY">Pokémon Unite</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_GOGmkusY">Pokémon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBoDsuE1t0Q">Pokémon Café ReMix</a>. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There were also two announcements on the adaptation front, with new episodes announced for the Netflix series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzL8NUUgwdc">Pokémon Concierge</a>, and the reveal of a brand new stop-motion animated show, Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's being developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a>, a stop-motion animation studio that has worked on films, television series, and video games for the last 40 years. You've seen their work if you've ever seen films, shows and games from series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, Chicken Run, and Shaun the Sheep. The only downside is that it won't arrive until sometime in 2027, so we still have some time to wait for its launch. </p>



<p>Pokémon Champions being shown off was one of the other highlights in the presentation, which is also releasing on Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and mobile devices. A gameplay overview dug into various elements of the game, including how battles, training, and recruiting Pokémon work. It's another title that doesn't have a 2025 arrival point, as it'll launch sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> getting a story trailer was what The Pokémon Company closed the event on, showing off more gameplay of it running on Nintendo Switch 2, and of course digging into the plot's narrative, and what appears to be the main conflict of the plot, that Pokémon are mega-evolving on their own, causing danger and chaos across Lumiose City. Which also reveals new mega-evolutions, like Mega-Dragonite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There was also the reveal of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle including Pokémon Legends Z-A, which will be available when the game launches on October 16, 2025.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Lastly, the other key highlight from the show was more information about the Pokémon Kanto theme park, which is due to be open "<em>soon</em>," which is being built in Tokyo, Japan, in an amusement park called Yomuriland. Over 600 Pokémon will be featured in the park, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemons-upcoming-theme-park-was-inspired-by-isolation-during-the-pandemic-says-junichi-masuda/">according to</a> The Pokémon Company chief creative fellow, Junichi Masuda.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As one of the longest Pokémon Presents events in the history of this showcase, it delivered on having enough announcements to fill up the 24-minute runtime. </p>



<p>This year's previous Pokémon Presents event was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">dedicated look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which also announced the October release date, and promised that the Switch 2 version of the game will feature "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>," which sounds great, but hopefully it doesn't mean that the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be anything like previous Pokémon games in terms of <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/">performance</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/betrayal-evil-of-pennywise-expansion-review-welcome-back-to-derry</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/betrayal-the-evil-of-pennywise-expansion-review-welcome-back-to-derry.1249983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> is one of my go-to games for replayability. With so many haunts, variability in gameplay, and even the way that a house develops differently sitting down you've always got to be prepared for something new. With the <em>Betrayal At The Niebolt House: The Evil of Pennywise</em> expansion, players get to take on the roles of a group returning after 27 years of torment to put a stop to Pennywise.</p>

<p>Included in the box you'll find a "Come Home To Evil" Scenario Card, ten Pennywise Encounter cards, four tokens, a Henry Bowers character overlay, and three IT-themed miniatures for Henry Bowers, Pennywise the Clown, and Pennywise the Spider. The expansion also includes four new rooms, a thematic story preamble for the Derry setting, and five new haunts inspired by <em>IT Chapter II.</em></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-11.jpg?itok=YxwpUwO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-11.jpg?itok=BquPj372 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>Come Home To Evil<br>
You are a group of friends who survived It's last feeding frenzy in the town of Derry when you were kids. Now, It has stirred again after 27 years, and you've been drawn back to the Neibolt House to confront the savage shapeshifter. As you explore the house and experience nightmarish events, will you turn on your friends? Or will you band together to defeat It once and for all?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is <em>Betrayal</em>?</h2>

<p>If you're new to <em>Betrayal</em>, the basic premise of it is that you and your group of explorers begin in the entrance hall of a mysterious mansion. As you take turns, you'll enter rooms and flip over tiles from a large stack of rooms, building the house as you play the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=1snp6sUF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=_Le6PjM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Exploring the house, you'll have a chance to earn items, experience strange and supernatural events, and discover ominous Omens. Once enough Omens have been gathered, a Haunt kicks off.</p>

<p>Once the Haunt kicks off, you're no longer playing a collaborative game of haunted house exploration, but instead, one (or maybe more) of the players will turn to the side of evil. They may have been killed, with the player now controlling monsters in the house, have become evil themselves, or some mix of the two.</p>

<p>Each team of players now has its own unique goals to win the game as new mechanics come into play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=t5Y-qPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=0aHkYeCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, there are a number of changes made to the base game so that no matter what, you always feel like you're part of the universe of IT.</p>

<p>The largest critique of <em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em>&nbsp;is also one that it shares with the base game, as you move into the Haunt and there's a chance for players to die if things go awry and if you die quickly, then you're fully out of the game. When these haunts can take 30+ minutes, that's time that you're just not getting to engage in any aspect of the game.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Betrayal At The Neibolt House</h2>

<p>In order to adapt your game to fit the theme of the expansion, you'll get to add your four new tiles to the game board. From there, you'll start your game as normal with the expansion-specific scenario card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=tR291cYU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=UVru6pKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The largest change is that instead of pulling Omen cards when you see an Omen symbol on a revealed room, you'll instead pull a Pennywise Encounter card. These cards pull inspiration from the source material, where you'll see a red balloon pop and potentially take damage, or overcoming floating lights is able to help you gain sanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The four new room tiles are unique to the expansion, but that doesn't mean that they can't be staples of your standard Betrayal experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that a few new tiles are in the deck, and you're pulling Pennywise Encounters instead of Omens, is really all you need to change going into <em>The Evil of Pennywise,</em> making setup an incredibly fast process and for it to be familiar for all returning players.</p>

<h2>Experiencing The Haunts</h2>

<p>Discussing the haunts can be a bit difficult without spoiling too much, so I'll keep it generic here for a bit. There are five themed Haunts in <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, each focusing on a key plotpoint from IT Chapter II, whether it be facing Henry Bowers, or facing off against Pennywise The Clown itself.</p>

<p>The game has done a fantastic job of adapting these scenes to best fit the gameplay of <em>Betrayal</em>, with Haunt number 2 in this book probably becoming my favorite Betrayal experience with a great mix of unique gameplay, interesting problems to solve, and a very visible threat continuing to grow until it becomes too much for any player to handle.</p>

Starting by having to fight Henry Bowers, then getting trapped in a disconnected house, having to find your artifacts, and then performing the ritual and taking on Pennywise.</p>

<p>It almost feels like there should be a recommended goal to build the house, but make alterations so you can do each of the haunts in order to create a legacy game feel as you and your friends make it through the events of <em>IT Chapter 2</em>.</p>

<p>To cap off the experience, I'm a big fan of the final two haunts of the game having no traitor, but Pennywise be an mechanic-driven antagonist. It stays true to the source material while also creating a very unifying experience for the players.</p>

<p>If there was ever a board game to use the IP of <em>IT</em> and Pennywise, <em>Betrayal </em>is the perfect choice. This expansion is incredibly fast to setup, enhances the base game, and allows for you and your friends to experience a variety of mechanically unique haunts.</p>

<p>While only adding five new haunts, this won't take long to get through; each of the haunts is very unique and memorable to the source material.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Betrayal</em>, there's really no way that more haunts are ever going to be a bad thing, this should be a must buy.</p>

Cool stuff! </p><p>However, some of the new games didn’t really have traditional, modern soundtracks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to reopen the Bureau.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Pokémon Presents, we saw a ton of new footage of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including a brand new Mega Evolution. But for lore nerds, what was far more interesting was the official, confirmed appearance of a very popular character from our adventure in Pokémon X and Y. And yes, I'm going to spoil it for you below this video, so don't keep scrolling if you don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you watched today's trailer, you'll know this isn't much of a spoiler: Emma, from Pokémon X and Y, is officially confirmed for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Emma <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">has been a part of fan speculation</a> ever since the game was announced, and theories about her presence in Z-A have only multiplied over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some context, Emma is a young girl in X and Y who is adopted and trained by Looker, a detective in Lumiose City who's become a fan-favorite character after multiple game appearances. At the end of X and Y, Looker effectively hands over the keys to his Looker Bureau to Emma. We've already seen that the Bureau appears in this futuristic Lumiose, so it makes sense that Emma would be running it. What's more, her design suggests she's still running around the city as the crime-fighting Essentia, based on the outfit under her jacket.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— 【公式】ポケモン情報局 (@poke_times) <a href="https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1947648245611536839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Emma's presence does beg some questions. When exactly is Pokémon Legends: Z-A set? We don't know! Emma is definitely older in her Z-A appearance, but probably not so much older that there would have had time to essentially rebuild Lumiose from the ground up, from its X and Y aesthetic to the futuristic city appearing in Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have there been time-traveling shenanigans? Is this Emma's daughter, also named Emma? Probably not that second one. Maybe the denizens of the Kalos region are just really, really fast at building cities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="de" dir="ltr">Serebii Update: Official artwork for Emma &amp; Mable in Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/zsdP9u36Dw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zsdP9u36Dw</a></p>— Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1947648427816308992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out here that another familiar face from X and Y appeared during today's trailer, albeit one that's maybe a little less instantly recognizable. If you spotted Mable, the new director of the Pokémon Research Lab, you might have recognized that she's a former member of Team Flare. She's uh, not exactly the most moral of people in X and Y, so it will be interesting to see if she's reformed since then or if there's something unsavory going on at the research lab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other reveals during today's trailer, including brand new characters like Naveen, Lida, and either Urbain or Taunie. We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">saw a brand new Mega Evolution, Mega Dragonite</a>. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-july-2025-everything-announced">during today's Pokemon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

"I’d like to express our thanks on behalf of the entire development team for the incredible response to the State of Play trailer. The game is still under development, but we’re really looking forward to sharing more in our Evo panel, and especially for fans to try it out for themselves with the very first trial version at the event. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My hope is to 'Assemble' with all of the players and create an amazing game together.
