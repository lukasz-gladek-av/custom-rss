<figure data-uuid="eb5c8d1d3feff"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eb5c8d1d3feff/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom is truly treating us Switch 2 owners this week, as it releases not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Village</a> on the new hardware, but also the brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Requiem</a>. Yep, that's on the same day as other platforms!</p>
<p>All of these launch on <strong>27th February</strong> (a Pokémon Day surprise, if we've ever seen one), and today, the Requiem reviews have started rolling in to clue us up on Leon and Grace's latest.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a fantastic time with RE9, calling it "a love letter that celebrates RE’s origins; one that will have you grinning from ear to ear until the credits roll" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a brief snippet, followed by the full shebang, so you can catch all the details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem sets a new benchmark for a series that has been pretty consistently great for the last decade or so. By combining classic survival horror with the more action-focused gameplay of RE4, the result is an experience paced to perfection. Add in a lore-heavy narrative and copious easter eggs, and you've got what might be the ultimate expression of Resident Evil</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:197602 @ 1772043321 -->
<p>But, of course, we're not the only ones with a Requiem review out today. Being the big multi-platform release that it is, there are a fair few write-ups for the game at large across the internet, and below, we've gathered a bunch of them together for you to easily see the full range of opinions. Do note that while we've highlighted some reviews that focus solely on the Switch 2 version, many outlets will have been playing on different platforms.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with a full beans 10/10 score for the PS5 version from <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/resident-evil-requiem-the-mercenaries-mode-326263-20260215">GAMINGbible</a>, where the outlet praised just about everything the game had to offer, particularly in its lore drops:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a horror game in its own right, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> is a very solid nine out of ten, but as a passionate fan of the series, it earns an additional bonus point thanks to the attention to detail and craft that’s gone into every pore of this game</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full scores kept coming with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-review">Eurogamer</a>'s 5/5 review, where even the game's strange second act wasn't enough to detract from the overall experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/resident-evil-requiem/review">Pocket Tactics</a> opted for the same score as us in another 9/10 Switch 2 review, calling out how impressively well the title runs on Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It runs incredibly well on the Nintendo Switch 2, boasts a compelling cast, and a story that fits nicely into the Resident Evil universe at large</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an opinion that was echoed in <a href="https://www.vooks.net/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-review/">Vooks</a>' 4.5/5 review of the Switch 2 version, where the hybrid's visuals got a major nod of their own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t say it’s the very first visually impressive game running on the Switch 2; however, it does stand out as one of the first day-and-date games that truly holds its own</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The Switch 2 version was laden with even more praise in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-review">TechRadar Gaming</a>'s 4/5 review, even if the outlet was a little disappointed with the game's second half:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To developer Capcom’s credit, while events may veer unapologetically into the camp and ridiculous, I was practically on the edge of my seat, wondering what on Earth could possibly happen next</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a slightly lower PS5 review, our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/resident-evil-requiem">Push Square</a> gave Requiem an 8/10 after struggling with the "imbalance" between the survival horror and action gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is brilliant, both when you’re avoiding zombies as Grace and cracking their skulls as Leon — but, eventually, there’s slightly too much of one and not enough of the other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll round things out with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-review-36772690">The Mirror</a>'s multiplatform 3/5 review, where, despite the "drop-dead gorgeous" visuals (even on Switch 2), that sense of imbalance was enough to bring things down a little:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem attempts to blend all eras of the franchise together with a dual-pronged campaign that features terrifically scary highs and some all-too terrifying lows</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em>Some</em> range in opinions, then, but it looks rather positive overall. As it stands, Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2 is currently sitting at a 90 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/resident-evil-requiem/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metascore</a> across 12 critic reviews, and an 88 on PS5 across 112.</p>

              <p>If you randomly received a bunch of test messages from the Xbox mobile app today, you didn’t do anything wrong. Many others, including myself, received the random spam messages this afternoon.</p> <p>On February 25, at around 12:30 PM, people with the Xbox app installed on their phone began receiving multiple test notifications in quick succession. I received eight such test messages, and all of mine featured the icon for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> for some odd reason.<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolefacee.bsky.social/post/3mfp7awat4s2h"> Others online shared screenshots</a> that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numbereighty3.bsky.social/post/3mfpakbuot223">showed even more messages</a> than I received. Each message contained the following text:</p> <blockquote><p>“This is a dummy message sent via Braze, please capture a screenshot once you receive it. This should take you to the recently added gallery.”</p></blockquote> <p>A quick Google seems to indicate that <a href="https://www.braze.com/product/overview">Braze is some sort of cross-platform social media and digital messaging platform</a> used by a lot of different big companies. So it seems likely that the Xbox app is using Braze or is switching over to it, and something went wrong and now a bunch of people have random test messages spamming their home screen.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Xbox for comment. We only sent one email. Not seven.</p> <p>The timing of this odd tech snafu couldn’t be worse for Xbox as the company is going through a big and <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">reportedly messy shake-up, with longtime CEO Phil Spencer stepping down last week</a> and a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">AI-focused CEO taking over in his place</a>. Some, including myself, have suggested this is the end of Xbox as we know it. That it might be dead. But I guess a dozen random messages in the afternoon proves it’s still alive. At least part of it.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC will release next week, in March 2026. </p>



<p>Team Ninja’s latest mainline entry to the Ninja Gaiden franchise was released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-world-record-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in October 2025</a> and has been faring quite well since release. Now, the developers have finally provided an update on how they plan to expand the experience with a brand-new DLC for the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-dlc-will-add-new-story-missions-weapons-and-more">Ninja Gaiden 4 DLC Will Add New Story Missions, Weapons, and More</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new post by Team Ninja on <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the release date of the new The Two Masters DLC for Ninja Gaiden 4, and it arrives on March 4, 2026. The new DLC will add three new chapters, weapons, enemies, and the Abyssal Road challenge mode. Learn more about the new additions below. </p>



<p>The story expansion for Ninja Gaiden 4 will see Yakumo and Ryu’s battle against fiends continue, as the two characters battle against even deadlier enemies, challenging bosses, and new trials. The new weapons will also help expand Yakumo and Ryu’s combat styles. Yakumo will receive the “Solitaire” scythe, which is great for crowd control, and Ryu’s will get “Jakotsumon” serpent gauntlets, which are useful for fast, close-quarters combat.</p>



<p>Abyssal Road in the Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters DLC is an endurance-style mode where players face 100 unique combat encounters. These encounters include enemies from both the base game and the DLC, and introduce the new Special Blood Essence and Frenzied enemy mechanics, which dynamically alter battle conditions.</p>



<p>The DLC will also arrive with “a wide range of quality-of-life improvements, balance adjustments, and bug fixes, including combat responsiveness improvements, new weapon set customization options, and fixes across multiple chapters to ensure a smoother experience throughout the campaign.” Players with Deluxe Edition or Deluxe upgrade will get the DLC for free, and others can buy it for $14.99 on March 4. </p>

Hocking had been leading work on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-hexe">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>, the upcoming entry in Ubisoft's flagship series that's set to feature a witchcraft vibe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to IGN, a Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed Hocking was "departing Ubisoft" without providing further detail as to why. His current role as creative director on Hexe will now be assumed by Jean Guesdon, the series' new Head of Content, who has a lengthy track record working on numerous titles in the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Clint Hocking, creative director on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe, will be departing Ubisoft," a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement provided to IGN. "We sincerely thank him for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team. The game will deliver something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise. Jean Guesdon, Head of Content for the Assassin's Creed brand, is now acting as the Creative Director on the project.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to sharing more information in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hocking initially joined Ubisoft to work on the legendary 2002 stealth action adventure Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, which he contributed to as a designer and scriptwriter. Hocking then served as creative director on its follow-up, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, before holding the same role on 2008's Far Cry 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a period away from Ubisoft, Hocking served years at LucasArts, Valve and Amazon, respectively, albeit without ultimately launching a game. Hocking then returned to Ubisoft to serve once again as a creative director, this time on Watch Dogs: Legion, which launched to a mixed response. Following that, Hocking moved over to Assassin's Creed, and had been leading work on Hexe out of the company's Montreal studio.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Ubisoft named its trio of top staff tasked with taking the Assassin's Creed brand forward. Development on the series will now ultimately be led by Martin Schelling, a veteran Ubisoft producer who previously served senior roles on Assassin's Creed titles such as Black Flag, Origins and Valhalla, and has recently served as Ubisoft's Chief Production Officer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schelling is being assisted Guesdon, who has worked on more than a dozen titles in the franchise, back to Assassin's Creed 1 in 2007, and notably served in director roles for both Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed: Origins. Finally, François de Billy will serve as Head of Production Excellence, following previously acting as Production Director on Valhalla and Origins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes follow last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">sudden departure of Ubisoft's previous Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté</a>, a veteran staff member who announced his departure from the company last October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embattled-ubisoft-forms-subsidiary-for-ips-like-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-with-the-help-of-116-billion-tencent-investment">shortly after Ubisoft's new Tencent-backed subsidiary Vantage Studios took control of the brand</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft-for-13-million-alleges-his-disguised-dismissal-was-to-avoid-severance-pay">Côté has since launched a lawsuit against Ubisoft</a> over the nature of his replacement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reaffirmed that the company had "several" Assassin's Creed titles in development, comprised of both single-player and multiplayer experiences. Back in 2022, Ubisoft announced a raft of upcoming games including Hexe, as well as a multiplayer spin-off codenamed Invictus. The company is also widely-expected to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ah-s-here-we-go-again-ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leak-responds-with-gta-meme">announce its long-awaited Black Flag remake soon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, nothing has been said of Hexe's progress, though fans had assumed this was simply because Ubisoft was focused on launching and marketing last year's Assassin's Creed Shadows. Almost a year on from Shadows' arrival, there's no suggestion that Hexe will debut in 2026, particularly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">Ubisoft delayed a raft of upcoming titles back in January, as part of the company's major corporate restructure</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Christian Petersen/Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has seemingly lost another one of its veteran developers as part of its ongoing organizational restructuring following the company's announcement of a <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"major reset</a></em></strong>" last month. After learning <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-taps-senior-assassins-creed-black-flag-devs-to-lead-assassins-creed-future/">who would be taking charge</a> of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise going forward in its new structure yesterday, today we've learned that <strong>Clint Hocking</strong>, a Ubisoft veteran who was the creative director on <strong>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</strong>, <strong>Far Cry 2, Watch Dogs: Legion</strong>, and most recently the creative director on the upcoming <strong>Assassin's Creed: Hexe</strong> project, has left the company.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/">VGC</a> initially reported Hocking's departure, and when we reached out to Ubisoft to confirm the report, we received the following statement in response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Clint Hocking, Creative Director on <strong>Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe</strong>, will be <strong>departing Ubisoft</strong>. We sincerely thank him for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter.</em> <em>Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team. The game will deliver something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise. <strong>Jean Guesdon</strong>, Head of Content for the Assassin's Creed brand, is now acting as the Creative Director on the project.</em> <em>We look forward to sharing more information in the future.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since the Hexe project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/">announced in 2022</a> alongside other future AC titles, we've only <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/">heard rumours about the upcoming title</a>, and most recently heard that it had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/">pushed to sometime in 2026</a>. Since the company's major restructuring announced last month, and now Hocking's departure, it seems likely that Hexe is one of the titles that was delayed in the portfolio shifting Ubisoft did, which included cancelling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/"><strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>.</a></p>



<p>Hocking was with Ubisoft across two significant periods in his career. The first was a nine-year stay at the company during which he led development on Far Cry 2 and Chaos Theory as creative director. He left in 2010 to join <strong>LucasArts</strong> for two years, then <strong>Valve</strong> for one year, and <strong>Amazon Game Studios</strong> for one year. He then rejoined Ubisoft in 2015, where he led the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/"><strong>Ubisoft Toronto</strong> </a>team on Watch Dogs: Legion before joining the Montreal team to work on Hexe.</p>



<p>Hocking may not have been with the Assassin's Creed franchise throughout his whole Ubisoft career, like another recently departed Ubisoft veteran, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">Marc-Alexis Côté,</a></strong> but as the creative director behind two of the company's most iconic titles, his departure signals how the company's 'reset' continues to include a changing of the old guard, of sorts, at least when it comes to those in major creative roles.</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">Julian Gerighty</a></strong>, and now Clint Hocking are all senior creative leads, all of whom have led successful projects for Ubisoft, all of whom the company has now lost in this reorganization. While we know that Gerighty left to go work on the <strong>Battlefield</strong> franchise, it's unclear who will scoop up Hocking and Côté.</p>



<p>Ultimately, in a company as big as Ubisoft, a project's success or failure cannot be laid at the feet of an individual person. That said, it does not bode well to continue seeing people who have stuck with Ubisoft for years look elsewhere in the industry.</p>

              <p>If you’re a <em>Pokémon</em> fan, you have no doubt experienced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-big-pokemon-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1849984595">mainline games</a> with all their catching, battling, and being the very best like no one ever was. But the series has a wide selection of spin-off games that span different genres and subject matter. Even if you’ve only ever played the RPGs, there’s probably something for you in the spin-offs simply because there’s such a wide range of experiences to be found. So what better to do with an eclectic collection of <em>Pokémon </em>games than to come up with a qualitative ranking to decide which is the best? We’re just days away from the series’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968">30th anniversary stream</a> where we’ll learn what The Pokémon Company is up to in 2026, so to get ourselves in the mood, we’ve rounded up 25 of the most notable <em>Pokémon </em>spin-off games, putting them in order from real stinkers to some of the most important games and sub-series in the franchise.</p> <p><em>This ranking was originally published in 2023.</em></p>

<p>The eShop listing doesn't go into any detail about what's added on the new hardware, but we're already taking it for a spin and have noticed a smooth 60fps bump, HD Rumble 2, and the addition of Mouse Mode for super quick card selection.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8uGWdOGD83w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uGWdOGD83w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8uGWdOGD83w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8uGWdOGD83w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uGWdOGD83w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41126extnyjm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<p>It's all a very welcome sight, and an unfortunate sign that we're probably signing ourselves up to another batch of sleepless nights. The only wrinkle that we've found so far is that there doesn't seem to be any way to transfer your data from the Switch 1 version to the Switch 2, which is weird. We'll keep investigating and will update this post if we find a workaround.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed this one back in 2024, we described the original Balatro as "Utterly sublime" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/balatro">our 10/10 review</a>, praising just about everything it could throw at us.</p>

<h2>Which Way, Witcher Man?</h2><p><em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> is all about telling the greatest, and often most outrageous, ballad possible. All of which is sung via our favorite bard, Dandelion, so you might expect a bit of embellishment when it comes to these tales. By swiping either left or right, you choose the path of your adventure while also trying to prolong death for as long as possible.</p><p>Like other games in the <em>Reigns</em> series, you're given a few values to monitor, and should those values reach a certain threshold, you're dead. Failure is inevitable and unavoidable, but it's what you make of the life you're given that matters, right?</p><p>As this is in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/witcher" rel="nofollow"><em>Witcher</em></a> universe, you're contending with several factions, of which you'll have to monitor several different values: Humans, non-humans, sorcerers, and Geralt's focus on hunting monsters.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>How does this work in practice, then? Curry too much favor with humans, and the rogue non-human faction, the Scoia'tael, will riddle Geralt with arrows. Conversely, if you're too chummy with the Scoia'tael, the city guard will hang Geralt for treason.&nbsp;</p><p>The ideal scenario is to have all of your values are at an even balance, right in the middle; this is done by picking choices by either swiping left or right. It's this simplicity that makes <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> so addicting, and it always had me going for "one more run" just to see what happens, since runs are quick.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Getting Inspired</h2><p><em>The Witcher</em>, be it in the original novels, video games, or TV adaptation, has a fair few silly moments, but the mood still typically errs on the side of "dark and gritty." The world of <em>The Witcher</em> is unforgiving and cruel, and even when you have moments of levity with Geralt's quips to Dandelion or hijinks with Lambert and Eskel, nothing is quite like <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Signature to the <em>Reigns</em> series is a sillier tone, and that is definitely what we have here. The tone was something I was conflicted with in the first few hours, but I soon came to a realization: These stories are all told through Dandelion's POV. It stands to reason, then, that ballads meant to entertain -- as told by the de facto comic relief character of <em>The Witcher</em> -- would be downright silly</p><p>I find that to be super clever. Rather than going for a darker tone, <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> doesn't hold back on the humor. Honestly, the writing brings a smile to my face. There are so many references to stories within the <em>Witcher</em> universe, but everything still feels fresh from this lighter perspective.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Geralt always loved a good bath, and he's a flirtatious fellow for sure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are some seriously funny situations you can find yourself in here, most of which are told through various "Inspirations." Basically, you have three Inspirations per run, and these are the topics of your song, as well as your objectives. They can alter some characteristics of your run, too, like making sorcerers easier to please.</p><p>The Inspiration "Geralt the Equine" requires you to be kind to Roach, so you'll be given many prompts relating to Roach and treating him like the good boy that he is. By being nice to Roach a number of times (or whatever your objective is at the time), you complete that Inspiration and unlock more, which allows you to see more characters, fight new monsters, and reach new endings.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Guess I'll fly now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Completing an Inspiration is easier said than done, as you'll have to contend with those values I mentioned. By balancing values and intuiting whether you should swipe left or right, these Inspirations are essentially just elaborate "Choose Your Own Adventure" puzzles.</p><p>With 51 different Inspirations, <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> is meatier than one would expect. Some of the playtime is padded by how obtuse some of these Inspirations are. Often, I'd feel like I had exhausted all my options across runs, picking different choices each time to see how the narrative would change, only to fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Such was the case with "Geralt the Shedder," which was a thorn in my side for most of my playtime. With this Inspiration, Geralt is tasked with releasing a curse-stricken snakewoman from her malady. Despite reading every option and picking every choice, the text just seemed a bit unclear on how to proceed.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2>How Do You Like That Silver?</h2><p>At the end of the day, Geralt is a Witcher, and a Witcher must do what they always do: Slay monsters. While some runs might end with your "Witcher" value so low that Geralt retires, you'll <em>usually</em> have to fight a few beasts before your eventual demise.&nbsp;</p><p>If Geralt's "Witcher" value -- how dedicated he is to his job -- fills too high, he has to fight. Normally, exceeding a value would end in death, but Geralt can fight his way out of a situation. As such, there are dozens of monsters in <em>Reigns: The Witcher</em>, and ones fans will certainly recognize: Drowners, Leshen, trolls, and heck, even dopplers.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Silver for monsters.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Combat doesn't deviate from the swiping gameplay <em>Reigns</em> is known for. It takes place on a grid, with Geralt on the bottom row moving from left to right. Swipe left or right to change direction, all the while tiles fall to the bottom row. The gist of it is, avoid enemy moves while trying to land on your own attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>The trick here is timing, and though it is simplistic in theory, it's honestly a bit difficult to get the hang of at first. Geralt's speed versus that of the falling tiles need to be taken into consideration. Sometimes, you'll have to weigh taking an attack from an enemy in order to land on your own attack to whittle away the monster's health.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reigns-the-witcher-signs.jpg?itok=Fw5FvBKJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Steel for humans.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Geralt can also use Witcher signs, which often spawn on the bottom row. These can rapidly change the pace of battle by slowing down enemy attacks, or even outright removing them from the board. The sign Quen, for instance, completely tanks an attack, while Igni hurts an enemy without needing to land on an attack tile.</p><p>Fighting monsters is a bit of a drag in the early stages of <em>Reigns: The Witcher. </em>As you achieve new victories in battle, your signs will upgrade, making battles easier. Some of the foes are just way too tough to fight near the start since their attack patterns can be nigh impossible to deal with without the help of signs.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Reigns: The Witcher</em> doesn't throw too many tough enemies until you've acquired more endings and Inspirations, but there are still some instances of RNG that will absolutely destroy you.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Reigns: The Witcher </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>You're able to reminisce about all of these weird, whimsical stories on various occasions. Throughout the land, certain individuals might call on Dandelion to perform -- these are called Song Puzzles. With these puzzles, you're met with a short narrative that tasks you to choose the correct prompt, with those prompts being various Inspirations you've completed.&nbsp;</p><p>These puzzles add another layer to <em>Reigns: The Witcher'</em>s gameplay that helps it feel more than a random re-skin of the usual <em>Reigns</em> formula. Overall, I sense that the developers and writers have a reverence for the source material, and those who are fans of <em>The Witcher </em>will definitely come to appreciate the callbacks and interactions with familiar characters as we wait for <em>The Witcher 4</em> in the coming years.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Reigns: The Witcher </strong>was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 12 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/reigns-witcher-review-ballad-by-dandelion]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I’ve long thought of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a>’s gunplay as an underappreciated component of the eerie survival shooter. It’ll never top anyone’s FPS all-timer list but its shootsticks are thunderously bangy, handling with both weight and smoothness, and your own barely-there mortality usually flavours encounters with a delicious high-stakes tension.</p>
<p>The only shortcoming is a lack of visual drama, but that can now be addressed with Cazanu’s new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/2059">CinematicFX mod</a>: where missed bullets hitting innocent masonry would previously amount to an understated thunk, scenery impacts now throw up vast clouds of dust, smoke, and debris. Cinematic effects, indeed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve given it a whirl and it works as advertised, imbuing STALKER 2’s action moments with some of the exaggerated wall-ruining flair you’d get from a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">FEAR</a>, or a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trepang-2">Trepang2</a>, or a Black. God, remember Black? Anyway, the mod does well to reflect the specific texture of whatever you’re raking, so while brick buildings erupt into a shower of heavy ships, metal structures flash with gleefully over-egged sparks. I absolutely went around hipfiring at empty buildings just to see what it’d look like, albeit only for a few seconds at a time, quickly running of out ammo on account of it still being STALKER 2.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that this is a relatively small change, as far as STALKER series tweaks go, which to some might seem like I’m tentatively trying Baby’s First Mod. "Urgh, James, why did you never write about <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_gamma">STALKER Gamma</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_anomaly">Anomaly</a> or any of those other massive mods that make the original games bigger and scarier and more apocalyptic?" Well, smart guy, it’s because I’m a coward. Ever think of that?</p>

            <p>Gather round, lovers of classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. The enhanced editions of the first two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> game, plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icewind-dale">Icewind Dale</a> and BG expansion Siege of Dragonspear, have gotten their first patch since 2021. Well, I say gotten, patch 2.7 is only out in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/228280/view/540005249102907846?l=english">Steam beta</a> for now - it'll hit GOG too further down the line.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We know it’s been a long wait since 2.6 (and for iOS players, since 2.5)," developers Beamdog wrote in <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/90560/new-infinity-engine-2-7-beta-release/">their announcement</a> of  We’re truly sorry it took this long. With 2026 marking 14 years since BG:EE first launched on PC, we want to thank you for staying with us on this journey."</p>
<p>At this point in these Infinity Engine games' lifespans, Beamdog noted that their main focus is just on keeping things running smoothly as hardware evolves and adding in some handy tweaks where possible. In line with that, patch 2.7 delivers proper Steam cloud saving, by making sure saves can be controlled via Steam's interface, rather than via in-game options menus. Native support for Apple Silicon Macs is another new addition.</p>
<p>Finally, dynamic language support should make it easier from here on out for Beamdog to add new translations to the games without the need for a full patch "on most store fronts". Instead, the developers anticipate being able to drop in new languages "on an ad hoc basis". Speaking of, patch 2.7 adds community-made Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, and Ukrainian translations to Baldur's Gate 2, plus Hungarian and Japanese ones to Icewind Dale.</p><p>While you'll have to opt into the Steam beta to enjoy those additions for now, Beamdog <a href="https://x.com/BeamdogInc/status/2026404541009187223">have confirmed</a> that the patch'll also be coming to the games' GOG versions on full release. They've also <a href="https://x.com/BeamdogInc/status/2026404639654940719">issued some advice</a> for folks looking to avoid have their load orders messed up. "For everyone using mods and worrying about mods, just copy/paste the whole of your game folder in the meantime," they wrote. "This is a beta for now, so you have plenty of time to do that copy. That way, after the live game updates, you'll still be able to launch 2.6 with all your mods."</p>
<p>If this patch has you fancying a return to one of these classic RPGs for the the first time in a while or thinking about trying them for the first time, here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear-review">some</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/icewind-dale-enhanced-edition-released">words</a> you may <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/not-forgotten-bioware-on-baldurs-gate">fancy</a> reading.</p>

            <guid>1446130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft revealed three <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-vets-leading-frnachise-series-vantage-new-games-2000672792">new leaders for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a>. One of those will now be taking over as creative director for <em>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</em> as its existing lead, Clint Hocking, departs the company after a cumulative 20 years working on Ubisoft games.</p> <p>As first <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/">reported by<em> VGC</em></a>, staff were informed about Hocking’s departure during an internal meeting with the new Assassin’s Creed leadership team just this week. “We sincerely thank [Clint] for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft said. “Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team.”</p>

 <p>Hocking first joined the French publisher in 2001 to lead projects like <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em> and <em>Far Cry 2</em>. He eventually left for <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-lucasarts-fell-apart-1401731043">brief stints at LucasArts, Valve, and Amazon Games</a> before returning in 2015 and later directing <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>. Like <em>Far Cry 2</em>, it was an ambitious, systems-driven sandbox where players swapped between procedurally generated characters on the streets of London to fight a fascist surveillance state. It was mechanically innovative but sales disappointed.</p> <p>Hocking has been on Hexe, the next blockbuster <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game coming in the pipeline with <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-extraction-shooter-assassins-creed-hexe-ubisoft-2000672574">a reported release date goal of 2027</a>. “After over a year of working in the darkness, happy to announce I’m working as the Creative Director on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe, with an amazing team in Montreal,” he posted back in 2022.</p>

 <p><em>Hexe</em> takes place in the “latter stages of the Holy Roman Empire,” involves witch trials, and would seemingly take on a much more survival horror-infused tone than other games in the series. We’ll see if that’s still the case now that, as <em>VGC</em> reports, Assassin’s Creed veteran Jean Guesdon, a director on <em>Black Flag</em> and <em>Origins</em>, is taking over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin’s Creed Hexe’s creative director will be leaving Ubisoft, with the new Head of Content taking his place. </p>



<p>Vantage Studio recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassin-creed-franchise-announces-new-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new leadership</a> for the Assassin’s Creed franchise, with a trio tasked with taking the brand forward. The new roles included Head of the Assassin’s Creed Brand, Head of Content, and Head of Production Excellence, with the Head of Content serving as the new creative director on Hexe. </p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-hexe-development-will-continue-with-new-creative-director">Assassin’s Creed Hexe Development Will Continue With New Creative Director </h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> report, a spokesperson revealed that Assassin’s Creed Hexe’s creative director, Clint Hocking, will be leaving Ubisoft. The spokesperson also revealed that development on the title will continue “with a seasoned team” and the experience will be “something distinctive within the Assassin’s Creed franchise.” More information will be shared by the studio “in the future.”</p>



<p>The report states that there is a new creative director for Assassin’s Creed Hexe: Jean Guesdon, the new Head of Content for the franchise. Guesdon is an experienced creative director, having served in that role on both Assassin’s Creed: Origins and Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. </p>



<p>Most recently, we were informed that Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-hires-veteran-writer-christopher-grilli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hired its lead scriptwriter</a>, who has worked on the scripts for Origins, Valhalla, and Mirage. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what is known about the game</a> is that it will be more like an old-school Assassin’s Creed game, with you playing as a female protagonist named Elsa, set in Central Europe during the 16th-century Holy Roman Empire. </p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that two Far Cry games and multiple Assassin’s Creed games are in development. Additionally, a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-listing-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Flag Remaster art book</a>&nbsp;surfaced online recently.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s privacy policy featured a disclaimer indicating users' voices were being used to train AI. This privacy policy, last published this January, has since been quietly updated to remove this clause.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ohpsksibwwtlsfe3n4dp6p2j?ref_src=embed">Spotted by user Cevian on Bluesky</a>, section 1 subsection xviii of the Policy, 'what data we collect and process' prior to the clauses' removal stated: "Where applicable, our services may offer voice-based chat functions that allow users to communicate with others in real time using voice. If you choose to use such features, we may process voice communication data for the purposes described in section 2 and section 13 of this Privacy Policy, including providing communication services, maintaining service security and stability, content moderation, and complying with applicable laws and regulations." This subsection has since been removed entirely</p>
<p>Section 2 of the Privacy Policy, titled 'why we collect and process your personal data' states, among many other uses: "Like many AI-powered experiences, we may use your user-generated input such as chat data to train and improve the model that we use to provide our Services. You can opt-out of model training anytime in your Service-related settings. Opting out will not affect your existing gameplay."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this was just once clause of Section 2, and other clauses including providing customer support and preventing malicious content to "ensure a harmonious and healthy online environment" are included. This same policy states that users must opt out of model training through service-related settings.</p><p>MiHoYo has been open about its embrace of generative AI in the past. It  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">released a teaser for an upcoming Unreal Engine 5 MMO project that used generative AI late last year</a>. This game, while largely still a mystery, will feature: "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System", All-Terrain Battle AI, and "Intellectual NPC".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted MiHoYo for comment on exactly what users' voice communication data is being used for, and why the subsection related to the gathering of such data was removed from the Privacy Policy.</p>

If you’ve been holding off playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> because you’re fervently hoping they’ll eventually add robot cowboy wizards, then firstly, you are eccentric to the point of deranged, and your mother and I are very worried about you, and secondly, why not play the Far Far West demo instead? It’s a one to four player co-op FPS with robot cowboy wizards out the wazoo. Except that robots don’t have wazoos, I think.

<p>
Far Far West feels gentler than Helldivers 2, so far, more of a Blazing Saddles-style romp than a Starship Troopers-esque bloodbath. It drops you into a procedurally generated map full of mission objectives and steadily spawning undead. 
</p>
<p>
You will: climb towers to find music discs; unearth graves; activate totems and kill 25 bony buckaroos; endure storms; possibly murder a ghost train; dual-wield; ride a minecart; gather gold; waggle your dukes; drop a nuke.</p>
<p>Just to add to your confusion, the combat puts me a little in mind of Destiny. Aside from dusting upstart skeletons with your clonky gaspunk ordnance, you’ll cast spells by flicking cards and summon a metal horse to ride around on. It’s just as well you don’t have a wazoo, because that metal horse looks like it’d be murder on the ol' nether regions, pilgrim.
</p><p>
There’s the usual progression and cosmetics nonsense between missions, because levelling up is how the West was won. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124540/Far_Far_West/">full game</a> will launch in early access this year. The devs are Evil Raptor, otherwise known for the well-received Akimbot and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pumpkin-jack">Pumpkin Jack</a>. The publishers are Fireshine Games, who also brought us Shadows Of Doubt and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reka">Reka</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3819240/Far_Far_West_Demo/">Find the demo on Steam</a>. I can’t think of a cowboy joke to end on. Oh wait, how’s this: if they added support for another two players it’d be a six shooter, ho ho!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Intlist, a website that allows users to post bounties “on griefers &amp; throwers” in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Valorant</span></i><span>, went live on February 23, and the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> community is particularly ticked off about it, mostly because they believe that NetEase is to blame for letting things get to this point in the first place. Intlist promises that those who respond to the bounties on the website will be paid for their work, but it’s clearly trying to have its cake and eat it too, as its founders state that the posted bounties are ”not a green light to harass the target.” In spite of this statement, several bounties on Intlist feature information about the targets in question that can be used to track them down elsewhere, such as their Twitch usernames.</span></p> <p><span>Founded in part by a “former pro player” called EchoRivals, Intlist’s official page on </span><a href="https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2025963500653203478"><span>X</span></a><span> states that the site’s creation is also NetEase’s fault, due to their implementation of Engagement-Oriented Matchmaking in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>(via </span><a href="https://fandomwire.com/marvel-rivals-fans-demand-shutdown-of-a-website-letting-players-post-bounties-on-throwers-and-griefers/"><i><span>Fandomwire</span></i></a><span>). “intlist.org exists because the devs left a gap — and the community filled it. Remove EOMM and actually ban throwers? We’ll gladly shut down.” For context, NetEase </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1955117077561593877?lang=en"><span>has stated</span></a><span> on multiple occasions that </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> doesn’t use EOMM.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000673662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673662">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However,</span><i><span> Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> players are upset with NetEase due to the lax methods it uses to punish people who throw games and grief teammates. Prior to Inlist’s creation, posts criticizing NetEase for not banning those who abuse this fact seemed to pop up on r/rivals on a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1r03rip/throwers_are_killing_the_game/"><span>daily basis</span></a><span>. “Can we just start banning people for throwing. I don’t get how we’re a year into this game and people are still throwing games left and right 24/7 without anything happening to them.”</span></p> <p><span>That being said, the same subreddit isn’t too fond of Intlist either, as the community is now asking NetEase to go </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/are_we_for_real_there_is_bounties_for_throwing/"><span>after the website</span></a><span> directly. According to several players in the thread, Intlist is clearly only making the problem worse. “There is also a Saudi millionaire paying people to target throwers, and now every game is people throwing each other’s games. Can we do something about this, please? Perma these people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps the most obvious sign that Intlist isn’t doing its due diligence here are the specific names featured in the bounties. One of the targets posted on the site is pro player Jay3, founder of the Jay3 Community Clash tournament, who has a 7-dollar bounty on his digital head. It also doesn’t help the founders’ case that the </span><a href="https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2026535423938265521"><span>latest post</span></a><span> on Intlist’s X page states that the website is currently down for maintenance so they can “cook a few things.” That is slightly underselling the reason behind its “maintenance,” as earlier this morning, founder EchoRivals announced on the official Intlist Discord server that the site is offline because they “detected unauthorized access.“ As a result, a “limited number of email addresses tied to bounty posts were exposed.”</span></p>

              <p>For nearly 20 years, I have been constantly astonished by what people are capable of creating in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>. Thanks to Creative mode, people have been able to build the most astonishing buildings, then towns, then cities, then countries. Maps like <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/city-of-newisle-v-07032015-solo-modern-build/">Newisle</a>, <a href="https://www.westeroscraft.com/">Westeroscraft</a> and, well, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PippenFTS">the entire planet Earth</a> are breathtaking pieces of work, years in the making, but it turns out they’re being created in easy mode. At least, in comparison to YouTuber stan616, who took it upon himself to spend nearly 80 days building a spectacular recreation of <em>One Piece</em>‘s Marineford in Hardcore, using over a million blocks.</p> <p>To explain: Usually, when people take on enormous builds like this in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, they play in the game’s Creative mode, which allows you to generate any number of any block type at will. Also, it lets you fly. This means that while still huge feats, people at least have the resources and dexterity to just crack on with constructing their masterpiece. But stan616 has opted for something far sillier. In Hardcore, every cube of every part of every building, ship, pathway and mountain has to be mined, harvested and crafted from scratch. Oh, and every tool used to do this, too. And if he wants to fly, that’s going to require vast numbers of eyltra and fireworks, and you can’t build while you’re doing that. Sound ridiculous enough? Because that’s the easy bit. That’d be how you’d do it in Survival mode. But in Hardcore, the world is also filled with aggressive mods spawning in and attacking, and should he die, the <em>whole build is lost</em>.</p>

 <p>Heck, if he fell from a wall he was building and missed a bucket clutch, he’d be in big trouble. Yes, he did the whole build with a Totem of Undying in one hand, meaning death can be averted, but once that Totem’s gone he’s got to swap another one in damn fast or he could be done for. Anyone who’s fallen in <em>Minecraft</em> will know how horribly possible it is to pop your Totem, then fall again before you know what’s happening. (Never. Dig. Straight. Down.)</p> <p>There are moments in the 90-minute edit of the 77 days this project took where he comes horrifically close to death. Like the time a Creeper sneaks up behind him as he’s building and blows itself up, popping his Totem and leaving him shaking in his chair. Or, far more stupidly, when he flew full-pace into a wall, narrowly missing the window, and nearly brained himself. Why do this? Why make it this hard? Because you gotta stand out.</p>

 <p>The video is great fun. Despite the embarrassingly pompous opening narration, the rest of the hour is nothing like that, with stan616 including moments of humiliation (like when he realizes he spent a day working on the wrong template), humility, and good-natured humor.</p>

  <p>You’ll note that when building in Hardcore, he’s working from schematics. This is a technique where elaborate crafts are designed in Creative, then the designs are exported with a mod like <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica">Litematica</a> into the Hardcore world. These then appear like ghosts in the world, and builders fill them in with the appropriate blocks. It makes builds of this scale plausible, but as you’ll see from the video, doesn’t guarantee success.</p> <p>The logistics here are phenomenal. The designing, the blueprinting, the mining, the networks of chests, the oxidizing all the copper, the smelting, the searching the map for Trial Chambers and amethysts and everything else, all before the build even begins, all of this while risking death at any moment. If you want to avoid all that for yourself, stan616 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/stan616">is selling the build on his Patreon</a> for $55.50.</p>

 <p>Just the thought of gathering the blocks required makes me want to go back to bed. In total, he used 1,187,773 blocks. But doing it in Hardcore? Dude. No. Just imagine. Absolutely incredible work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon has been a part of my life for as far back as I can remember. I was just starting first grade when Pokémon Red and Blue came out on the Game Boy, but I still remember it like it was yesterday. My brother and I only had one Game Boy between us, and since he was older, he got to play it far more often than I did. Before we got a copy of Pokémon Blue for Christmas that year, the only Game Boy game we'd actually had the chance to play was Tetris. So needless to say, I was instantly enamored with the concept of catching and battling with all 151 of the original Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of those original Pokémon in that game, I was always particularly interested in Eevee. Not because it's arguably the most adorable, but because of all of the evolutionary paths you could take once you had one. And you could <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/eevee">only have one per playthrough</a>, after all, since you couldn't actually catch Eevee in that game. As one of the most versatile Pokémon out there and I always find myself choosing a different Eevee-lution each time I play a new game.</p><div id="234361"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234361" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eevee - LEGO Pokemon</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now in 2026, with a new collaboration with LEGO, I had the chance to experience Eevee evolving into something much more exciting: an adorable little LEGO set. LEGO provided IGN with a copy of the set for a test build and I was lucky enough to be the one to put it together. At just 587 pieces, it only took me a few hours to assemble, but I was in love with every part of this build. Each new section of the set has you slowly piecing together a surprisingly lifelike LEGO Eevee, and the end result is nothing short of phenomenal. Once I placed the final touch of the build, I was honestly amazed at just how good it looks despite being made up of tiny plastic bricks.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Pokémon Eevee Build</h3></div></span></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $59.99, the LEGO Eevee build is the most affordable of the three Pokémon sets now available to buy. And of those three, I think Eevee is the most realistic looking. Due to its price compared to the other sets, it's also the one I think most people are probably going to buy. Despite that lower price point, however, the whole build still felt like a premium experience. The set came with a total of six bags, all of which were made of nice recyclable paper. The instruction booklet also included the official Pokédex entry for Eevee, which I thought was a nice touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You start off the build with Eevee's core body. This is the foundation of the whole set, which you can see start to come together with various places for the legs, tail, and head to connect. This is the least exciting part of the whole experience, but I always enjoy these parts of the build due to the insight you get into how LEGO actually designed these sets to work. The connecting slots for legs give you a glimpse of how you'll be able to articulate those limbs once they're added, and the giant connector on top gives you an idea of just how massive Eevee's head is going to be compared to the rest of its body.</p><p>I was honestly amazed at just how good it looks despite being made up of tiny plastic bricks.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you move on to building the actual legs, the set really starts to come to life. Starting with the front legs, the instructions have you build one limb at a time before attaching it to the main body. Each of these is fairly straightforward to put together and looks fairly blocky until you get to the voluptuous fluff on each shoulder. You use a series of rounded pieces that really smooth out the overall look of each leg. Then the final touch of rounded pieces at the end ensure almost all of the LEGO studs are covered up. The end result is a surprisingly soft looking leg that will contribute to Eevee's overall fluffy visage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After you finish building and attaching all of the legs, you can already start playing around with all of the different positions the final product will be able to move into. Each of the legs can articulate forward and backward, allowing you to move the body into various sitting and standing poses. I was even able to move it into a full standing position, which is admittedly much harder to balance once Eevee's head and tail are added to the equation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tail is where I really felt the build starting to add enough complexity to earn its 18+ age rating. Because you're essentially turning bricks into what will appear as a fluffy tail, you need to ensure that each of the pieces is facing the right outward direction. I ended up making a few mistakes here without realizing and had to backtrack later so I could actually connect all of the rounded pieces on both sides later on. You shouldn't have any issue here unless you try to rush through things and ignore instructions like I do. Once the whole thing is put together, it attaches neatly to the back of the set and can move from side to side.</p><p>"Each of the legs can articulate forward and backward, allowing you to move the body into various sitting and standing positions."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the entire body and tail put together, you get to move on to Eevee's surprisingly massive noggin. I was particularly nervous about this part of the build because I had feared that it would involve some sort of sticker element. I had put together <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-wednesday-things-apartment-76785">a LEGO Wednesday set last year</a> that had a ton of different stickers and made some horrendous mistakes that made the end result look just weird enough to bother me forever. Thankfully, my fears of having an Eevee with horribly misplaced eyes were quickly banished when I found that the pieces themselves already had the designs printed on them. So once you build the actual head, all you need to do is attach a few pieces to get a perfectly designed face.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final step of the build is Eevee's long pointy ears. These are relatively easy to put together, and like all of the other parts of the set, can be articulated into various positions. Each ear can be moved up and down, allowing for a symmetrical look or that cute lopsided look that you see on the box. And although you've already got a mostly complete Eevee set right up until this point, it isn't until you add the ears that the whole thing comes alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All-in-all, I found the Eevee set to be one of the most enjoyable LEGO builds I've ever done. I'm obviously a bit biased due to my deep nostalgic love of Pokémon, but it's honestly just a really cool build at a surprisingly affordable price point. And now that it's been fully put together I have a full-on Eevee action figure that I find myself adjusting and displaying in random spots throughout the house. It's my new favorite display set and it has me excited for what the LEGO Pokémon collab will bring in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior Audience Development Strategist and Writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the hallways of the sinister sanatorium where Resident Evil Requiem’s opening hours take place lies some of the most frightening encounters I’ve experienced in the series to date. With my headphones on and the lights off, the ninth mainline adventure in Capcom’s longrunning survival horror saga forced me to endure moments so palpably tense and prolonged I discovered muscles to clench that I didn’t previously know I had. Yet hours later I was no longer holding my breath, but holding my fist in the air instead, as I gleefully mowed down masses of undead meatsacks like it was D-Day in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/world-war-z">World War Z</a>. In an effort to please both survival horror stalwarts and action-horror advocates, Resident Evil Requiem runs the gore-soaked gamut from anxiety-inducing chills to trigger-happy thrills. The result is yet another supremely hair-raising horror story, despite the fact its most potent scares have all been delivered by the time it arrives at its more gloriously gung-ho second half.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not unlike 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a>, Resident Evil Requiem initially focuses on a young FBI agent, in this case series newcomer Grace Ashcroft (Angela Sant'Albano), a fresh-faced analyst who’s sent to investigate a series of mysterious deaths among the survivors of Raccoon City, several decades after the 1998 outbreak. Grace’s flashlight-lit forensic search through the grimy insides of a shuttered hotel is ultimately short-lived, however, since she’s soon ensnared by Victor Gideon (Antony Byrne), Requiem’s main antagonist whose menacing air, disgustingly disfigured face, and greasy goggles make him seem like some sort of steampunk Emperor Palpatine. Victor traps Grace in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center, a Spencer Mansion-style labyrinth of locked doors crawling with all manner of flesh-eating freaks, but thankfully help is on the way in the form of uber stylish series veteran, Leon S. Kennedy (Nick Apostolides). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survival horror’s preeminent himbo has clearly seen better days – the strange bruising on his skin suggests he’s battling some sort of affliction potentially related to T-Virus exposure, while the shiny new Porsche he’s driving implies he’s also not immune to a midlife crisis. But it’s Grace who is the standout here. Resident Evil characters have historically exhibited an exaggeratedly campy quality that’s injected a large dose of goofiness amidst the gore, but for my money this inexperienced FBI agent is by far the most relatably human heroine the series has ever had. Her evolution from being perpetually on the brink of a panic attack to becoming self-assured enough to fight back made for a journey that I found as captivating as it was consistently creepy. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Saving Grace</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem allows us to alternate control between Grace and Leon at specific story junctions over the course of its roughly 10-hour campaign, but it’s the former whose predominately stealth-based sections are undoubtedly the most fear-inducing. Underpowered and under constant threat from twisted stalker ghouls that are liable to descend from the rafters at any moment, Grace’s efforts to escape from the terrors of Victor’s hospital is a wonderfully stressful slab of unrelenting survival horror. There’s precious little ammo to find, a miserly number of inventory slots to manage, and Grace moves at such a slow speed that it makes timing your careful crouch-walk to avoid a prowling pack of zombies an exercise in pinpoint pathmaking, especially if you don’t have a rare breakable bottle to toss in order to create a distraction. All the while you have to puzzle through a stimulating series of body part-based riddles and elaborately locked doors, never really knowing when you’re going to turn a corner and come face to flabby face with a grotesquely girthy golem that’s urgently squeezing its way down the hallway towards you.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent so much time trying to steer clear of the numerous considerable threats, that on the occasions Grace was forced into a confrontation the results really rattled me. When played in the default, claustrophobic first-person perspective, her guns feel genuinely startling to fire and the impact of every precious pistol shot is immense. Bullets tear the festering flesh off zombie faces leaving eyeballs to dangle from their stems, and blood spatter paints the walls and persists even when you backtrack through the area later on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gallons of gore that covers the floor isn’t just there for spectacle, mind you, since Grace is equipped with a handy blood collector that allows her to syringe up the infected plasma pooling around zombie corpses, and combine it with other pieces of scrap to craft invaluable items like medkits and single-use hemolytic injectors. The latter can be jammed into the spine of an undead monster caught unaware, causing their entire body to swell up and explode in the most gloriously blood-soaked manner of stealth-kill possible, but you can also use it to effectively dispose of a body you’ve downed previously. I found that to be a smart move in areas that I knew I’d be revisiting, since Requiem’s zombies also have a terrifying tendency to reanimate and mutate when you least expect them to. (Seriously, these guys reform and come back more often than The Eagles.)   </p><p>On the occasions Grace was forced into a confrontation the results really rattled me.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace’s quest only grows more intense as it takes her through the suffocating shadows of the hospital’s basement and beyond, but moving through Requiem’s danger-filled surroundings at a snail’s pace didn’t just keep my nerves on edge, it allowed me to observe and appreciate the efforts that Capcom has put into enhancing the eerie behaviour of its undead army. These are no longer the groaning, foot-dragging mouth-breathers encountered during the original Raccoon City outbreak, instead they retain traces of humanity that somehow makes them seem far more unsettling than the more animalistic werewolves in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>. Like the ones that idly flick light switches on and off like bored toddlers, or the others that wander around muttering and laughing to themselves before suddenly collapsing to their knees to hungrily feast on the corpse of one of their former friends. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Leon: The Professional</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Grace’s plight is a desperate and deliberate crawl that had me second-guessing every shadow, the ominous sounds of silence are shattered by the roar of ferocious ultraviolence when you switch control to Leon for what are initially brief, tension-breaking bursts, as everyone’s favourite ex-RCPD recruit attempts a not-so-subtle rescue mission. These levels default to a third-person view to really show off the slaughter, and within minutes of his arrival I’d slipped comfortably back into Resident Evil 4 mode, nailing headshots and ending the undead with effortless execution moves. To my surprise, however, Requiem quickly pushed the insanity meter beyond <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising</a> levels of delirium by allowing Leon to actually wield a chainsaw to carve through the zombie crowds. Leon’s sections are up-tempo and gruesome to a degree that left me giddy, and almost every major zombie Leon dispatches is met with a delightfully deadpanned dad joke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Grace must use the scarce amounts of scrap in her surroundings to make her own rapidly destructible knives, Leon is toting a powerful hatchet that can be easily maintained with an everlasting flint. While Grace has to carefully count each round in her small handful of handguns, Leon enjoys an extensive bevy of teeth-rattling boomsticks from beefy shotguns to head-splitting sniper rifles. Plus, if Leon gets bored of his own weapons he can use someone else’s – after killing a zombie who drops a fire axe or lead pipe, he has the option to smoothly scoop it up and launch it at another enemy nearby, which is every bit as slick and satisfying as the similar sword-flinging feature of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>. That’s not to mention that instead of having to painstakingly harvest blood samples to craft with, Leon is rewarded with a special currency for every kill that can be conveniently cashed in at a de facto ATM for artillery to buy useful weapon upgrades, extra ammo, and even body armour. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, there's no off position on Leon’s arse-kicking switch – his gunplay is John Wick-slick and bloodier than ever before – and in addition to his surging slaughter of zombie hordes it’s also within Leon’s levels that the bulk of Requiem’s appropriately epic boss encounters take place. There are plenty of colossal clashes to be found here, from brand new behemoths to brilliantly reimagined threats from previous Resident Evil stories, and there isn’t a single Del Lago-sized dud among them. I particularly loved how the hulking nasty faced inside a cramped chapel midway through the story subverted my expectations of how a Resident Evil boss fight should play out. Sure, being tasked with blasting the glowing weak points that cover a marauding monster’s torso is nothing new. That is, until you realise that while piercing each swollen blister does inflict damage to the beast, it also spews streams of infection onto the zombie underlings around him, instantly mutating them into brawnier forms of backup for you to contend with. Leon may be armed to the teeth, but that doesn’t mean Requiem doesn’t still find creative ways to ramp up the challenge.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shorn of the Dread</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I love Leon, though, I do wonder if perhaps his sections become a bit too dominant once Requiem settles into a more action-oriented groove in its second half, as the story moves beyond the grounds of Rhodes Hill and deep into what remains of Raccoon City. Let me be clear, Resident Evil 4 is my personal favourite instalment in the series, so it certainly gave me a great deal of pleasure to once again wield a military grade arsenal and pull-off skull-shattering finishing moves as the series’ hunkiest mutant murderer. There’s also plenty of variety in the violence, from a full-throttle highway chase sequence to heavy artillery strikes that seem straight out of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> campaign. But after playing almost exclusively as Leon through a roughly five-hour stretch towards Requiem’s conclusion, I did find myself yearning for a few more tastes of Grace’s superbly nerve-shredding stealth sections as a more regular change-up from Leon’s comparatively scare-free carnage.</p><p>There's no off position on Leon’s arse-kicking switch.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That desire was eventually gratified to some extent by a terrifyingly taut late-game tip-toe through a facility crawling with some truly menacing monsters returning from the series’ past, but given that the story ended soon afterwards my overriding impression of Requiem was that it was very much a game of two halves. The former predominately a slow and steady scare-a-thon, and the latter largely a run-and-gun splatterfest. I very much enjoyed both flavours in their own right; I just wish for the sake of its pacing that they’d been blended together a touch more over the full course of the journey. Instead, Requiem is a bit like ordering a whiskey and Coke and having it served in two separate glasses instead of being mixed into one. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/tristan_ign_au/lists/tristans-favourite-survival-horror-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, Grace’s absence from a significant stretch of Requiem is justified within the context of its story, and overall it’s a tale that gripped me harder than a zombie nurse gnawing on my neck. There are a number of blindsiding twists that cast new light on the origins of the Umbrella Corporation and the ambitions of its founder, along with an excellent mix of zombie-riddled locations both fresh and familiar to puzzle and pummel your way through, and plenty of vital notes to collect along the way. Some of these memos are crucial to understanding the intriguing mystery behind Grace’s abduction and the truth about her past, while others are just genuinely funny gags to help ease the tension. After encountering a specific zombie type in one medical wing that was obnoxiously singing at the top of her lungs, I got a good laugh out of uncovering a doctor’s report that had diagnosed her with ‘Main Character Syndrome’, for example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also one particularly iconic location that Leon explores that I’m reluctant to spoil here (although it has been teased in pre-release trailers), which is jam-packed with fun Easter Eggs that made it a real treat to revisit as someone who’s been enjoying Resident Evil adventures ever since the T-Virus made its first outbreak on a black-bottomed CD for the original PlayStation. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Like the result of an experiment conducted in an underground Umbrella Corporation lab, Resident Evil Requiem successfully splices two separate strains of survival horror together into the one highly infectious new mutation. It signals the return of a series legend and the arrival of a likeable new lead, amps up the gore to a new stomach-turning standard, and unleashes a scarier breed of zombie alongside some truly beastly boss fights. The lack of any meaningful side content like The Mercenaries mode is a touch disappointing, and I do wonder if a slightly more consistent balance could have been struck with the ebb and flow from jaw-clenching moments of tension to all-out assault, rather than frontloading the story with frights before giving way to a more bullet-riddled back half. Even so, from my first trembling steps into its shadows all the way to the tremendous, titan-sized takedown at its climax, Resident Evil Requiem kept me completely absorbed and consistently entertained whether it was all hair-raising or all guns blazing.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been playing Overwatch during the last couple of weeks, you’ve likely been haunted by the sound of a pair of small thruster engines followed by a squeaky “meow” serving as a precursor to your chosen hero’s face being scratched to death. Well, in order to soften this horror, Blizzard has released a hotfix attempting to address the terror that is Jet Pack Cat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch, released on February 24, applies the following nerfs for the supposed support character — not to her healing capabilities, nor her core offensive skills, but to the perks that lead to her becoming a killing machine.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch "The Reign of Talon" New Hero Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These include her minor perk, Claws Out, having its cooldown increased from 6 to 8 seconds, meaning you’ll at least feel the pointy end of her paws a little less frequently. Also listed is a significant reduction to the major perk, Territorial, which sees the damage dealt reduced to 33% from 50%. Interestingly, there is no mention of any planned tweaks to her Ultimate ability, which effectively guarantees an enemy elimination due to its pick-up-and-drop nature. Cats don’t like wells, unless they’re lobbing you into one, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will come as no small irony to long-term Overwatch players that the owner of this feline friend, Brigitte, also pretty much broke the game upon her introduction back in 2018, which led to a fair few weeks of her being practically unkillable before her loadout was addressed. While Jet Pack Cat is nowhere near as powerful as the Swedish support hero was, there’s no denying that they were a nuisance that needed to be tweaked. We’ll see if these fixes have the desired effect over the coming days, but as is the case with any online multiplayer game, adjustments always need to be made, especially when introducing five brand new characters in one go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of those other additions, they’ve also received a mixture of buffs and nerfs to their kit and cooldowns. Fellow healer, Mizuki, has seen the duration of his ultimate, Kenkai Sanctuary, increased from 6 to 7 seconds. DPS hero Emre’s burst rifle has had its damage increased from 20 to 22, and flaming fan-wielder Anran has seen the cooldown of her Inferno Rush ability reduced from 8.5 to 8 seconds, as well as an increase to the distance you can move while Dancing Blaze is active to 2.25 meters from 1.5.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not as new as Emre or Anran, fellow walking weapon Vendetta has seen the damage of her overhead sword swing reduced from 130 to 120, as well as a bug fix allowing for that move to now be affected by horizontal knockbacks. Then there’s Domina, my dear beloved — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/domina-from-overwatch-will-you-be-my-valentine"><u>you can read all about how much I enjoy her here</u></a>. The destructive tank has, thankfully, only received a minor nerf, with the cost of her ultimate increasing by 12%. I’ll still be able to have my fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you make of each of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes">five new heroes that have made their way into Overwatch ever since it ditched the “2”?</a> Let us know in the comments.
