            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sony has announced a new type of State of Play event, which will premiere tomorrow, on November 11, 2025. It's called a 'State of Play Japan,' and is set to specifically feature games coming to PlayStation made by developers in Japan and across Asia. </p>



<p>The event will be 40 minutes long and kick off at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CET, and according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that revealed the event, it'll feature "<em>beloved series to distinctive indie creations</em>," and be hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, who players might recognize from their work on several anime series including Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, and their work in several video game series including Final Fantasy, Ys, and Fire Emblem.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As it is a live stream event focused on games from Japan and across Asia, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStationJapan">PlayStation Japan YouTube channel</a> will feature a full Japanese-speaking live stream. If you want to follow along but don't speak Japanese, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation/featured">watch a version with English subtitles on the main PlayStation YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike previous State of Play events, there hasn't been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">a long, stretched-out rumor cycle</a> leaking the event and what will be shown, so most of what we see tomorrow will be a surprise. That said, there are definitely a few games that come to mind that we could see tomorrow.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">is out on PS5 and PC later this week</a>, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see it appear at this event as a final marketing push. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls from Arc System Work</a>s is another game that could very likely be shown off here, as we've seen a couple of gameplay trailers by now, and it was playable at EVO 2025. We might finally get a proper release date for it at tomorrow's event, even if it might not arrive in 2025.</p>



<p>And if it doesn't arrive in 2025, then that might also be because it'll arrive alongside PlayStation's new fighting stick accessory, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike, which is due out in 2026</a>. It's a good bet that whenever Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is ready to release, the FlexStrike will not be far behind, if it isn't already out, or even launching on the same day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/legos-statue-of-liberty-1635-piece-set-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-sells-tons-at-this-record-low-price-2000642378</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego%E2%80%99s-statue-of-liberty-1-635-piece-set-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-sells-tons-at-this-record-low-price.1348606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Few ideals are more powerful to the collective of humanity than freedom and there are few symbols more representative of that concept than Lady Liberty standing tall in New York Harbor. <strong>LEGO Architecture Statue of Liberty Set #21042</strong> brings this iconic monument into your home, pieced together from an astounding 1,635 pieces, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5416/">and now is available for only $80 on Amazon, down from its regular $119 price</a>. This is the lowest price this set has ever reached and for this reason alone, it’s a great opportunity to own a piece of American history in buildable form.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5416/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>More Than Just a Monument</h2>
<p>The level of detail LEGO packed into this 1,635-piece set goes way beyond what you’d expect from a normal building kit. The <strong>flowing robe features intricate folds and textures that catch the movement of fabric frozen in copper</strong>, while the detailed pedestal includes accurate shield designs, brick detailing patterns, and columned balconies that mirror the real monument’s neoclassical architecture. The seven-ray crown sits atop Liberty’s head, with each ray individually constructed to represent the seven continents and seven seas. The <strong>upraised arm holds the golden torch</strong> that has guided ships into New York Harbor for over a century, and the iconic tablet inscribed with the date of American independence rests in her left hand.</p>



<p>The sand-green and beige color scheme is really special as it authentically represents the patina that developed on the statue’s copper exterior over decades of exposure to the elements. When France gifted the statue to the United States in 1886, it shone bright with the vibrant copper tone of a new penny. The chemical reaction between copper and salt air in the sea slowly worked to transform the surface into the distinctive blue-green hue we recognize today. LEGO replicated this with perfection, and gives the model a historical accuracy that makes it not just a toy but something worth collecting.</p>



<p>The building experience itself provides hours of engaging activity that appeals to both teens and adults. Coming in at 1,635 pieces, this set offers true complexity without becoming overwhelming and strikes that perfect balance where you’re challenged but never frustrated. The construction techniques Lego used to recreate the statue’s curves and architectural details teach valuable lessons about how angles, specialized pieces, and creative stacking can produce organic shapes from rectangular blocks.</p>
<p>When complete, the model becomes a remarkable display piece that draws the eye in any room. <strong>Standing over 17 inches tall including the pedestal</strong>, the finished statue offers visual impact that simply cannot be matched by other, smaller Lego sets. The decorative nameplate included adds a museum-quality touch that frames the model as a serious architectural reproduction rather than a simple toy. The display works equally well on a desk in a home office, on a living room bookshelf, or on a bedroom dresser, starting conversations with visitors who can appreciate the craftsmanship involved.</p>
<p>At $80, this set is a great value considering piece count, display impact, and historical significance. The 33% discount off the standard $119 price represents real savings on a set that will remain desirable long after you are done building it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of 2025, but there’s still time for one final Sony State of Play showcase in November. The special Japan and Asia edition of the presentation features special looks at upcoming games where development is localized to those areas. </p>



<p>The September edition of State of Play was a biggie. We got an exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine gameplay trailer</a>, new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saros footage</a>, and much more. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was it for Sony’s State of Play events this year. However, PlayStation has one more event in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The State of Play Japan &amp; Asia broadcast takes place on November 11 (or November 12 in Japan), starting at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET / 11 PM CEST, or 7 AM JST.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony blog</a> had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This Tuesday, we’re bringing you a special episode of State of Play running for more than 40 minutes, focusing on games created in Japan and across Asia, alongside a few other exciting updates.</p>



<p>From beloved series to distinctive indie creations, the show, hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, will be packed with great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, it will be 40 minutes long—so it’s not short!</p>

                <p>Celebrated video game composer Mick Gordon has revealed that he is working on his first full video game soundtrack in five years, for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">upcoming FPS game Defect</a>. The cyberpunk-themed asymmetric shooter will see Gordon bring his skills to the game, and for this project, he's aiming to push the music to the very edge of what's possible using his signature talent for heavy sounds and distortion.</p><p>"It's celebrating that deformity, almost like some form of rebellion," Gordon said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/mick-gordon-is-asking-how-heavy-can-we-get-it-in-his-first-full-game-soundtrack-since-doom-eternal-im-really-exploring-the-extremes-of-distortion-with-this-project/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "I'm always trying to push it, always trying to push it more. Like, how heavy can we get it? I'm really exploring the extremes of distortion with this project. How distorted can you get it, where you lose the musicality, and then bring it back."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr-kLx-ZPhM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wr-kLx-ZPhM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gordon added that he'll make use of synthesizer sounds traditionally associated with the cyberpunk genre, and he has a few ideas of how to put his own spin on those instruments. "Setting that background theme against this dystopian cyberpunk world gave me all sorts of ideas, especially with regards to synthesizers, and how synths should resemble analog machinery in a way," Gordon said. "Something that's palpable and tangible, and it must be alive within the sort of grimness of the cityscapes that this game takes place in."</p><p>One surprising influence for Defect's soundtrack comes straight out of the 1990 live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, with Gordon remarking how one scene in particular featured a track during the <a href="https://youtu.be/CDJev_Sw-j8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Foot Clan recruitment drive</a> that caught his eye--or ear, to be more precise. While Defect marks the first full soundtrack that Gordon will be working on since Doom Eternal--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-composer-distances-himself-from-the-n/1100-6476272/">a project that ended Gordon's collaboration with developer Id Software</a> after a <a href="https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce" rel="nofollow ">dramatic falling out</a>--he hasn't been sitting idly by.</p><p>Gordon helped compose a large chunk of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-crispy-critters/1900-6418033/" data-ref-id="1900-6418033">Atomic Heart</a> soundtrack and contributed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/absolum-review-a-sleeper-hit/1900-6418419/" data-ref-id="1900-6418419">Absolum</a>, DotEmu's new fantasy-themed beat-'em-up that recently launched. Between those games, Gordon also did "production role stuff" with several metal bands.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Survival Unit - the new strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming game, which is coming to mobile devices, will make its debut later this month, on 17th November.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit kicks off with the protagonist in a "mysterious" hospital, having been used as an Umbrella test subject. "As you uncover the truth and attempt to escape, the story unfolds into a parallel world where original characters from the original series return," the official blurb teases, promising a "chilling new narrative".</p>

<p>As for those returning faces, Resident Evil: Survival Unit players can expect the likes of Leon Kennedy and Albert Wesker, as well as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, though the main series developer Capcom is working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality".</p>
<p>The studios have said Resident Evil Survival Unit will "appeal to both longtime fans and new players". Will you be playing?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world of Resi, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snowy-resident-evil-film-set-photos-give-credence-to-major-plotstory-leak">set photos from the upcoming Resident Evil film adaptation from Weapons director Zach Cregger show a very snowy Raccoon City</a>. As shown in these photos, Cregger's take on Resident Evil will feature an establishment called Oak Street Diner, which could be a little nod to Tall Oaks, a town in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>. One of the bus signs also points to Central Station, which pops up in the games.</p>

            <p>The Steam page of recently released post-apocalyptic survival shooter Misery - seemingly unaffiliated with the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery">Stalker mod called Misery</a> - has been pulled offline, with developers Platypus Entertainment alleging it's the result of a DMCA takedown filed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-shadow-of-chernobyl">Stalker</a> creators GSC Game World. Platypus say they're in the process of fighting this claim, which an email shared by Platypus themselves suggests is all about copyright and purported use of GSC's "game content" without permission.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of writing, I can verify that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/">Misery's Steam page</a> has gone missing, but it appears that all of the public info currently available about this apparent claim comes entirely from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">Steam post</a> in which Platypus share that email. "GSC Game World attacked Misery with a DMCA strike, and the store page is now suspended, so you cannot buy the game at the moment," the post reads. "In their claim, they state that MISERY infringes on their IP and that players' reviews mention S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which means it hurts their interests. This is absolutely untrue, and we will fight back to reinstate MISERY on Steam."</p>
<p>I've reached out to GSC Game World for comment.</p>
<p>According to the alleged email from Valve in the post, the storefront operators took down the game's page automatically when the takedown was lodged, in order to avoid potential liability for any copyright infringement themselves under the rules of the US <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/dmca/">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>. Platypus will have the opportunity to file a counter-notice attempting to prove the copyright infringement claims are inaccurate, and if they do, the copyright claimant would then have 10 business days to file a full-blown lawsuit. If such legal proceedings weren't initiated in that timeframe, the game would automatically be reinstated on Steam.</p><p>"We’ve filed an appeal and are waiting the 10 business days for it to be reviewed," claims a post to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/855897901096108062/1028671244087861359/1436697103660355687">Discord post</a> by Platypus' primary solo developer Maewing. "We’re continuing to work on updates; there will be two big updates at the end of the month and before the New Year. Right now we’re working on cats and dogs.  Thanks everyone for your support and for spreading the word. And please, don’t insult GSC, just say that they acted unfairly."</p>
<p>In the original Steam post, they claimed that Misery is "a completely different concept" and "uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from [GSC's] games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed." "We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP," Platypus added, calling the alleged takedown "an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation."</p>
<p>Further complicating the matter, as documented by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>, is an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/gsc_taking_down_misery/">initial response</a> to the alleged strike filing which saw Maewing use at least one slur. They've since edited this Discord post and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/855897901096108062/1028671244087861359/1436506305673040052">apologised</a> for "old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements", but it still makes all of their posts urging others not to insult GSC ring very hollow.</p>
<p>There's also potential for the whole situation to have a political dimension to it, with GSC being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stalker-2-moves-the-series-forward-and-why-it-reflects-ukraines-rebellious-spirit">a Ukrainian studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or7deo/few_screenshots_from_the_misery_discord/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit users</a> having spotted signs of support in Platypus' Discord server for Russia in the ongoing conflict between the two countries. I've not been able to verify the chats they've screenshotted myself, due to the Discord allegedly having been scrubbed in the wake of the takedown request. The screenshots include more slurs, this time of a racial nature, and support for the Russian state-linked <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60947877">Wagner Group</a>, a private military company accused of war crimes. There are also a bunch of instances of the letter Z, which has become a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/why-has-the-letter-z-become-the-symbol-of-war-for-russia">symbol of public support</a> for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Maewing claimed in the Discord post which saw them apologise: "I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds."</p>
<p>As of writing, no other games similar to Stalker look to have been hit with takedowns and to my knowledge GSC haven't filed takedowns against the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chernobylite">Chernobylite</a> and STALCRAFT: X before.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-watch-series-10-is-going-for-peanuts-as-stock-clears-out-fast-even-lower-than-last-black-friday.1348570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple unveiled its latest Watch Series 11 in September this year, and while we’re not expecting discounts on the new version anytime soon, you can grab the previous generation model, which still packs a serious punch for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5410/">Currently, Amazon has the Apple Watch Series 10 (GPS, 42mm) with a Jet Black Aluminum Case and Black Sport Band going for $280, which is 30% off its original price.</a> Several other color options are discounted too, but this Jet Black version is currently the lowest-priced one available. This watch covers all the essentials, and Apple also throws in three months of Apple Fitness+ to get you started on your journey. If you’ve been holding out for a deal on an efficient Apple smartwatch, now is the time to make a move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5410/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>A Solid Combination of Health and Fitness Features</h2>
<p>The Series 10 comes with a 30% larger screen area compared to older models, but it’s also lighter and thinner, which makes it easy to wear the entire day. It measures all the ways you move with the Activity Rings, and lets you track a range of workouts while also providing advanced metrics. Those into water sports will appreciate the built-in depth and water temperature sensors, along with 50m water resistance. Take it to the pool or dive deep in the ocean without a worry.</p>
<p>Health-wise, you get access to the ECG app, Blood Oxygen monitoring, high and low heart rate alerts, and Cycle Tracking with ovulation estimates. It can even monitor how well you rest at night, as well as detect sleep apnea with the Vitals app. You’ll also enjoy key safety features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS, which can be a lifesaver in unfortunate circumstances.</p>



<p>When you have it connected to your phone, you won’t need to pull your iPhone out to check notifications, control music, or take calls. The watch lets you do all of that and more right from your wrist. Even better, you can unlock your MacBook, plus get directions to your iPhone with Precision Finding if it ever gets misplaced.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as strong, and you can expect the watch to hit 80% in just 30 minutes when it’s running low.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5410/"> On most days, the Apple Watch Series 10 would set you back about $400, but this deal knocks a solid chunk off the price</a>. You can treat yourself to one for less than $300 if you act fast.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-9-new-gamemodes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/9-new-gamemodes-are-in-development-for-battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-post-launch-content.1348564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has found that at least 9 new gamemodes for Battlefield 6 are at various stages of development for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-amazon-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s post-launch content.</p>



<p>Last month, we revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-more-game-modes-could-be-coming-to-battlefield-6-datamine-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six game modes were in development for Battlefield 6</a>; since the release of the game’s first season, more have been added to the game’s files. Two of the gamemodes that we previously reported on, Sabotage and Strikepoint have already been confirmed to be coming to the game, which leaves Raid, Payload, Squad Shootout, and Tank Hunt remaining for the original six.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-new-battlefield-6-gamemodes">Five New Battlefield 6 Gamemodes</h2>



<p>Yet, within the game files, Insider Gaming has also discovered five new gamemodes which are labelled at ‘Prototypes’ and are seemingly very early in development.</p>



<p>These gamemodes are: Convoy, Fantastic Four, Gunmaster, Touchdown, and Tug of War. The strings of the files are as follows:</p>



<p>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Convoy/Setup/MUT_Convoy Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/FantasticFour/Setup/MUT_FantasticFour Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Gunmaster/Setup/MUT_GunMaster Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/Touchdown/Presentation/GM_Touchdown_Presentation Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/zPrototypes/TugOfWar/Mode/MUT_TugOfWar</p>



<p>As mentioned in Insider Gaming’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage on Naval Combat</a>, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>While some of these gamemodes may just be internal codenames, Gunmaster in particular is almost certainly a ‘Gun Game’ like gamemode where the players’ weapons change per kill. Traditionally, the player has to cycle through 20 different weapons and needs to knife and kill an enemy for the final kill in order to be victorious. </p>



<p>Tug of War likely refers to a Breakthrough-esuq gamemode, possible where players need to capture flags to progress through the map. If a flag is captured, the next flag will push the enemy team back, but can be retaken to continue the “tug of war” for victory.</p>



<p>As for what the other gamemodes could be is anyone’s guess, and we’d love to hear what you think they could be on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After a total of 61 hours—the last dozen of which were spent grinding Job Points and <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-farm-the-best-rare-weapons-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">farming the best rare weapons</a>—I finally wrapped up my first playthrough of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles.</p>



<p>Though I still have the optional Midlight's Deep dungeon to clear, I had planned to take a break before returning to the epic tale of Ramza Beoulve. My plans, however, are now changing much sooner than anticipated. This is all thanks to a handful of exceptional community mods available for the PC version of the game, which are already prompting another full playthrough. These mods dramatically enhance the gameplay, promising an experience even more engaging than the last.</p>



<h2 id="h-content-restored-dark-knight-onion-knight-balthier-and-luso-are-now-part-of-the-ivalice-chronicles">Content Restored: Dark Knight, Onion Knight, Balthier, and Luso Are Now Part of The Ivalice Chronicles</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">The Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs are now fully functional in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last month, I reported on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-mod-begins-restoration-of-war-of-the-lions-content/">how a dedicated fan began restoring the content cut from the War of the Lions version</a>, which serves as the basis for the current mobile versions of the game. Not content with just bringing back Balthier with his devastating Barrage skill, which can break the 999 damage cap with ease, and the ever-useful Luso, modder Dana Crysalis has now restored for generic units the two Jobs cut from the War of the Lions: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/34?tab=files&amp;file_id=134">Dark Knight and Onion Knight.</a></p>



<p>The implementation of these Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is flawless. The mod also adds a paging system to the job menu, allowing the game to display more than 19 jobs. Unlocking them, like in War of the Lions, requires some effort, though.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Job</th><th>Requirement</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Dark Knight</strong></td><td>Level 8 Black Mage, Knight, Geomancer, Dragoon, Samurai, and Ninja</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Onion Knight</strong></td><td>Level 6 Squire and Chemist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The high Job requirements to unlock the Dark Knight, in particular, are well worth it. This Job has long been infamous for being extremely overpowered, thanks to its Darkness Job Command, which grants the unit not only HP and MP restoration with Sanguine Sword and Infernal Strike, but also great damage in wide AOE with Abyssal Blade, at the cost of HP.</p>



<h2 id="h-introducing-new-jobs-blue-mage-and-red-mage">Introducing New Jobs: Blue Mage and Red Mage</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Alicia and Lavian now come with unique Jobs that makes them more than special generic units</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dana Crysalis didn't stop at job restoration; they also implemented two brand-new Jobs inspired by the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance games: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/26">Blue Mage and Red Mage.</a></p>



<p>These versatile spellcasters are available right from the beginning of Chapter 2 and are assigned to the special generic units Alicia and Lavian. This finally gives these often-overlooked units a meaningful role, allowing them to learn monster abilities and use a variety of magic spells from other spellcasting Jobs. Even in its current state, this mod is a must-download to spice up the experience, especially for players who previously struggled to find a use for Alicia and Lavian.</p>



<h2 id="h-heretic-ramza-the-story-in-the-job-title">Heretic Ramza: The Story in the Job Title</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Ramza is no longe</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> a Heretic just in name</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the few criticisms of the original game was that Ramza's special job, Squire, remained unchanged for the entire game, despite his significant character development. While The Ivalice Chronicles addresses this by changing his Job to Gallant Knight in Chapter 4, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/39">Heretic Ramza mod</a> by Serbagz takes this concept to its logical and emotional extreme.</p>



<p>With this mod, Ramza’s special Job title now reflects his standing in the evolving narrative:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chapter 1:</strong> Noble</li>



<li><strong>Chapters 2 &amp; 3:</strong> Mercenary</li>



<li><strong>Chapter 4:</strong> Heretic</li>
</ul>



<p>Once he earns the Heretic title, Ramza also gains the Fell Knight's Shadowblade and Duskblade abilities. This highlights an excellent story connection: though Gaffgarion was ruthless, he acted as a temporary mentor in Ramza's darkest days, making the acquisition of the Fell Knight's signature abilities a fitting—and powerful—bit of character growth. It offers a great contrast to Delita, the commoner who became king with the support of the church.</p>



<h2 id="h-level-scaling-necessary-rebalance">Level Scaling: Necessary Rebalance</h2>



<p>With the introduction of new, powerful Jobs and abilities, the potential for overwhelming the game is high, especially since enemy levels in story battles typically don't scale.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/30">Level Scaling mod</a> (also by Dana Crysalis) ensures this doesn't become an issue. By implementing enemy level scaling even in story battles, the game remains highly challenging even after you engage in heavy grinding. This gives a real purpose to those <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/fun-magic-build-to-solo-battles-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">fine-tuned character builds </a>and ensures every story battle requires genuine tactical effort.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-you-being-pulled-back-in-i-know-i-am">Are you being pulled back in? I Know I Am</h2>



<p>After learning about all these mods, I couldn't wait to install them and see how they make Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles an even better game. Needless to say, they do. Although I had planned only for a quick test, I ended up spending a few hours exploring the new features, further condemning me to my fate: experiencing the War of the Lions again. Not a bad fate to succumb to, as <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">the game is still one of the best tactical RPGs ever released</a>, decades after its original release.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wake-of-the-water-takes-steam-supergame-enshrouded-to-incredible-new-depths-and-levels-2000640440</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wake-of-the-water-takes-steam-supergame-enshrouded-to-incredible-new-depths-and-levels.1348543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Every search for life begins with a search for water, and while <em>Enshrouded</em> has certainly been lively since its January 2024 launch, its new aquatic update is about to take it to entirely new levels of mindblowing gameplay.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/"><em>Wake of the Water</em></a>, the biggest update yet to the enormously popular Steam survival RPG, adds so much depth and so many new elements and features that even seasoned <em>Enshrouded</em> players will feel like they’re playing an entirely new game.</p>


<p>Rivers flowing and waterfalls surging with dynamic voxel water are the newest features in the realm of Embervale, and they aren’t just pretty backgrounds. The new water biome is dynamic and completely interactive – swim, collect it, use it to grow food and to terraform the world around you. But, be alert — with this new aquatic element comes new amphibious enemies that you must defeat, or perish while trying.</p>
<h2>An Incredible Detailed Layer</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">As you explore the new world that&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> brings to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em></a>, you’ll quickly learn to become one with the water. Swimming and diving will be new skills to master, long with using your grappling hooks underwater. Beneath the surface lie chests to open and plants to harvest, while back on land you’ll learn how to enhance your base with water dispensers, rain barrels, and hydro-powered mills to process food or forge new materials.</p>
<p>When you discover the new Veilwater Basin biome, you’ll be sucked in for hours of incredible exploration. Hidden ruins, valuable gold ore and aquamarine to mine, capybaras and wildbeast crabs to observe, and settlements that strange lizard people call home will be revealed. But so will the Drak, a dangerous new amphibious enemy that claims the Veilwater Basin as their own and will be all too eager to lure you into battle in the water, where their amphibious nature gives them a huge advantage that you’ll need to adjust to quickly or be defeated.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000642184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642184">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_2000642187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642187"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642187">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Learn New Survival Skills</h2>
<p>Although the new depths of <em>Wake of the Water</em> present new challenges and danger in the form of the Drak, they are also a new source of sustenance — provided you’re able to master the rod and reel. As you encounter a new survivor selling gear and bait, soon you’ll progress through five different fishing rods and a variety of bait, including worms, moths. fireflies, and frogs. Your prizes come in the form of three common tiers of fish and 5 epic tiers, and as your talent in these mini-games grows, so do your rewards: loot bags, legendary weapons, trophies, and more. The fish themselves can be turned into meals that improve your stamina, mana, and your diving time and ability.</p>
<h2>Prepare for Battle</h2>
<p>Lest you think&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water</em> is a peaceful and relaxing update to&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em> where you just hang out and fish all day, you’ll quickly find that the combat aspect of the game is turned up significantly. There are over 60 new weapons, most notably an entire new class of weapons called greatswords. Seven new armor sets and over 10 new fighting skills are unveiled in&nbsp;<em>Wake of the Water.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The combat overhaul with this update also rebalances the fighting statistics — elemental weapons now always inflict elemental damage, gem slots are increased in importance, and the fighting user interface has been overhauled and improved. You’ll need to obtain and master these new weapons and skills quickly, because the danger from the Drak and other enemies is an ever-present peril in this new world.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Keen Games</a></p>
<h2>A Great Game Redefined</h2>
<p>Gamers know that an “update” can mean anything from a virtually undetectable patch to a complete teardown and rebuild that can either make a middling game incredible or ruin a favorite game for good. <em>Wake of the Water</em> is the rare update that takes an already great game and adds elements and layers and features that create immersive new experiences while keeping in place the features that drew you to it in the first place.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000642188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642188"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642188">© Enshrouded Wake of the Water</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5280/">The November 10 drop of <em>Wake of the Water</em></a> fully redefines how you’ll play&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, with features like fully submerged bases, new skills like swimming and fishing, and lethal new enemies and the all-new weapons you use against them. It’s an exciting new era of&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, leading into 2026 when the game makes the jump from Steam and PC Early Access to a console and PC launch in 1.0. The possibilities are endless as the realm of Embervale is transformed by the engrossing aquatic elements of <em>Wake of the Water</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-boss-locations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-are-the-bosses-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-how-to-find-boss-locations-explained.1348540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite bosses are a feature that players have become well-versed with other the years, though The Simpsons mini-season shakes things up and makes them harder to locate.</p>



<p>The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite made a big change to bosses, which don’t have fixed spawn locations and only appear on your map when you are near them, making it harder to track them down when completing quests or on the hunt for loot.</p>



<p>For all the details on how to track down each of the bosses available in Fortnite during The Simpsons mini-season, check out our guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-witch-marge-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Witch Marge in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Witch Marge spawns randomly during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, though she is most commonly found in the Springfield Town Center POI.</strong></p>



<p>In this area, Witch Marge can be encountered in the woods between Springfield Town Square and Kamp Krusty, though she can also appear in the POI itself, and these aren’t the only locations where she can be found.</p>



<p>You should also check out the area south of Evergreen Terrace and hunt in the Springfield Slurpworks POI, both of which are areas where Mitch Marge also spawns regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-evil-homer-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Evil Homer in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Evil Homer does not have a fixed spawn during The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, but, like Witch Marge, is often found in the Springfield Town Square POI near </strong>the courthouse<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>However, it’s not guaranteed he will spawn there, and you should check out other areas too if you’re on the hunt for him. Personally, I’ve found the east of Evergreen Terrace by Springfield Gorge to be a location where Evil Homer is often lurking.</p>



<p>Finally, the fields around Cletus’ Corn Hole are a common haunting ground for Evil Homer, so you should check this area too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-krusty-the-clown-in-fortnite-x-the-simpsons">How to Find Krusty the Clown in Fortnite x The Simpsons</h2>



<p><strong>Like other bosses in The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite, Krusty the Clown does not have a fixed spawn location. However, he can commonly be encountered at the Springfield Slurpworks.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for any boss to take down, Springfield Town Square is an ideal landing spot, as all three bosses can often be found here, but there are other areas to check for Krusty, too.</p>



<p>Like Evil Homer, Cletus’ Corn Hole is a good hunting spot for Krusty, along with the small island found east of Donut District—although this location is quite out of the way off the beaten track.</p>

<figure data-uuid="38971ea3a75fd"><a title="Yoshi Mario Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38971ea3a75fd/yoshi-mario-galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are still a good five months away from the release of <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, but the rumour mill is already kicking into gear about Mario's next big adventure.</p>
<p>First, there was the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/a-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-debut-this-month-its-claimed">rumour</a> that an official trailer would be heading our way at some point this month, theoretically before <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong> arrives in theatres on 21st November. That was enough to get us excited, but its follow-up had us feeling a little more... mixed. Yes, we're talking about that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">leaked Yoshi design</a>.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen it yet, this weekend, US baking company <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">Pillsbury</a> revealed its upcoming 'The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough'. A harmless enough endeavour, if a little premature, but the big talking point is the presence of the big green dino on the front and back of the box.</p>
<p>Sporting a similar Illumination sheen to the character design spotted on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">tie-in Old Spice bottle</a> back in September, it's becoming increasingly likely that this is the Yoshi we'll all see in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie next year. Nothing is confirmed yet, of course, but we can only see so many pre-release promo products before we start to think that this is the real deal.</p>

<p>The big question now is, how do we all feel about this Yoshi design? The entire thing looks just about safe enough that we can absolutely believe it's true. It looks... like Yoshi, but the little scales all over his body are a nice little bit of detail, we suppose.</p>
<p>The stumbling point, and we're sure many of you will be in the same boat here, is those eyes. They are just so big. So white. So shiny. No matter which way we move our heads, it feels like those baby blues follow us around the room. How are we supposed to go about our daily lives with the knowledge that out there somewhere, Yoshi is staring at us?</p>
<p>But what do you think? Is this leaked Yoshi design everything that you would have hoped for in the Mario Galaxy Movie, or is it freaking you out a little? You can let us know your thoughts in the following poll, then head to the comments to share your full dino discussions.</p>

            <p>What were the chances Blizzard would find a way to monetise arguably the most exciting feature coming to World of Warcraft in years? High, it turns out. Blizzard will introduce a premium currency to the game, specifically for housing, called Hearthsteel.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24242736/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight">Blizzard announced the Hearthsteel currency in a blog on Friday evening</a>, explaining that you will be able to use it to buy items and furniture when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing-in-december-ahead-of-midnight-expansion-launch">the housing system arrives in December</a>. Almost immediately, the post clarified that, "The VAST majority of Housing items are (and will continue to be) earnable in-game."</p>
<p>Think of it similar to how mounts are currently handled: there'll be a few available to buy with real money, but most of them will only be earnable in the game. And those race- and class-based housing options the game will have, such as undead-themed buildings for undead characters: they won't be available to buy.</p>
<p>But as much as the blog did to pre-empt and address topics for backlash, backlash did inevitably follow. As of the time of writing, the official blog has more than 500 comments and <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/developer-insight-hearthsteel-virtual-currency-and-housing-in-midnight/2196144">the official forum post has more than 2500</a>.</p><p>"Absolutely not," wrote Uddermassage in the game's forum. "You need to go back to the drawing board. This microtransaction crap can go jump in a lake." Rambush, meanwhile (I like these names), said, "I can't believe someone seriously typed this up and thought to themselves, 'Yeah, that's reasonable, they’ll go for that!'"</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The concern is understandable. This is the first actual premium currency World of Warcraft has had. You can already buy gold, and you can directly buy items such as mounts, but there's not a separate currency for this. The only separate currency the game has is Trader's Tender, for the Trading Post, which is entirely earned and used for a kind of battle pass-like system. This, then, is a notable change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are deeper suspicions as to Blizzard's intentions here - or rather, the intentions of Blizzard's owner, Microsoft. Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-push-for-high-xbox-profit-margins-behind-job-cuts-publishing-on-playstation-and-cancellation-of-projects-like-perfect-dark-claims-report">Microsoft is reportedly pushing its gaming division to operate with a 30 percent profit margin</a>, and there are few more reliable cash generators than the monthly subscription-fuelled World of Warcraft. Might Hearthsteel have been pushed through because of this? Perhaps the timing of the announcement is just bad.</p><p>Questions, questions; the answers will be provided when Blizzard unleashes housing in World of Warcraft in December. So far the feature looks fantastic, having spent years in development to develop ideas like neighbourhoods and groups of people living alongside each other. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">"It's a kind of a sociological experiment," Blizzard told us recently.</a></p>

            <p>Yoshi's appearance along with a few other potential story spoilers for the upcoming Super Mario Bros Movie sequel - The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie - have started trending on social media thanks to, of all places, Pillsbury. Yes, the American brand of baking products has seemingly leaked a few of things we will be seeing on the film's release.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Homer Simpson - Dough!</p>

<p>While Yoshi's face is beaming away on the front of a box of pre-cut sugar cookies shaped like green spotted eggs, you can also see Nintendo's famed plumber Mario riding on his back on the other side of the packaging.</p>
<p>Along with Yoshi soaring through the air, this box of cookie shapes also features the Comet Observatory, which is the home of Rosalina and the Lumas. This one image all but confirms her appearance in the upcoming film (though, given it is called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, this isn't exactly a surprise).</p><p>Another little image worth drawing attention to on this cookie box, meanwhile, is the graffiti tag in the upper left corner of the maze puzzle on the back of the package. Correct me if I am wrong, but that sure looks like Bowser Jr. to me.</p>
<p>You can check out images of Yoshi, Mario, Bowser Jr.'s  graffiti and the Comet Observatory below. At the time of writing, the cookies are still listed online via <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">TopsMarkets</a>, but are currently out of stock. </p>

<p>Despite what I first thought when I saw these images last night, this isn't actually our first look at Yoshi in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. After a spot of internet searching this morning, I also came across posts with images of Old Spice underarm and body spray, with Nintendo's green dinosaur-like creature smiling back. These images were first shared last month, but it seems no one thought they were real (until now).</p><p>While Yoshi features on a spray called Brooklyn Bounce, which is described as having a "smashed fruit" scent, Luigi also pops up on a can of Desert Detour along with a Tostarenan from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s Sand Kingdom. Desert Detour apparently smells like "vanilla sounds" (not sure how that works).</p>

<p>Last week, it was reported we will be getting a trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie later this month, as it is allegedly attached to the upcoming release, Wicked: For Good.</p>
<p>Many have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">now shared their hopes that Rosalina will be voiced by Ariana Grande</a>, who plays Glinda the Good in the Wicked film adaptations.</p>

<p>Primarily, the update addresses the Chinese translation issues present in the game by implementing a fan mod from Team Cart Fix. Team Cherry praises the team's work, stating that the individuals involved "are well-versed in the (quite dense) narrative and lore of both Hollow Knight games, and understand the subtle links and connections that should be retained in the text"</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957tvrpgq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> continues to grow increasingly popular this Winter, the demands for duo queue are only getting louder as pairs of players are getting a little tired of getting wiped out by teams of three.</p>
<p>As of writing, players have two supported options. You can queue up as a solo player and opt not to fill up your squad with strangers, which will match you with other solo players. Alternatively you can queue up as a team of three which will obviously slap you into games with full squads of three.</p>
<p>However, if you queue up as a party for two and opt not to fill your empty spot with a third player, you'll still be queued up against teams of three rather than other duos. This means those without a third wheel are forced to play in matches at an unavoidable disadvantage.</p>

<p>"EMBARK please make duos mode, that's in my opinion [the] only thing this game is currently missing," wrote user MediumDefinition2480 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oqta8j/embark_we_are_in_desparate_need_of_duos_mode/">on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a>. "I am really tired of playing against trios while I want to play with my friend." That post is sitting on just under 10,000 upvotes at the time of writing, and is just one of a variety of similar posts begging for official duo support.</p><p>The reason why this may <em>not</em> have official support is down to fears of splitting the player base, and not wanting to split the online lobbies into three separate groups of players: solo, duos, and full squads. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">While Arc Raiders is incredibly popular right now</a>, as time goes on, having a three-way-split could in theory lead to extended queue times.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-night-city-traffic-overhaul-lets-you-customize-traffic/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-mod-%E2%80%98night-city-traffic-overhaul%E2%80%99-lets-you-customize-traffic-for-each-district.1348486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 modding scene continues to improve CD Projekt RED's game in multiple areas. We previously covered mods that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-third-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add proper third-person</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-cyberpunk-2077-mod-combat-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve combat</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-game-save-companions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add permanent companions</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-responsive-v-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase immersion</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-dreampunk-3-1-1-enhanced-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>Now, modder cradilyex has uploaded '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night City Traffic Overhaul</a>' to the Nexus website. This mod's goal is to add vehicles that are present in the base game but are missing from traffic, depending on the Night City district. For example, you will see gang vehicles patrolling their turf, NCPD vehicles patrolling rich areas, taxis and buses, Delamains and big trucks in industrial areas, Militech and Wraiths in the Badlands region, and Moxes in Kabuki. What's even more interesting is that the players can tweak everything through a handy menu. You could, for instance, greatly increase Scav presence or Police presence in a district and do the exact opposite in another, depending on your vision for that district.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The mod also lets you introduce modded vehicles into regular Cyberpunk 2077 traffic by adding their entity names (such as "Vehicle.oranje3_militech_legatus" for the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/23289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Militech Legatus SPD-10</a>) to the lists in "r6/scripts/NightCityTrafficOverhaul/NCTOmoddedVehicles.reds". </p>



<p>According to the modder, the vehicle swap itself has no impact on performance. However, depending on the chosen traffic density and your hardware, performance may decrease in certain instances. Moreover, some modded vehicles could also reduce performance.</p>



<p>Night City Traffic Overhaul is compatible with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taxi Work in Night City</a>, which adds missions where you transport passengers as a cab driver, and with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night City Alive</a>, which adds motorbikes to traffic, makes gang members able to drive through the city, and both civilians and NCPD more aware and reactive to what happens around them.</p>



<p>It is no doubt impressive what modders can do with Cyberpunk 2077 despite the lack of full modding tools. The Witcher 3 eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got REDkit in May 2024</a>; hopefully, CD Projekt RED can release a similar tool for their other game, too. It would help fans tide themselves over until the sequel, which might very well feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer modes</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-series-creator-keanu-reeves-return-johnny-silverhand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand</a>.</p>

			<p>New Valve hardware, potentially including the highly anticipated Steam Frame VR headset and a new Steam Controller, could be announced as early as Wednesday, November 12, according to online rumors. More critically, the timing suggests this could be accompanied by a reveal for the long-rumored HLX project (Half-Life 3).</p>



<p>The rumor originates from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley">Brad Lynch</a>, a known and highly reliable source for Valve hardware and display leaks. Lynch revealed on Discord, as reported on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ot28nw/sadlyitsbradley_steam_frame_information_likely/">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>, that new hardware announcements are imminent. The announcement for the Steam Frame VR headset is expected to precede pre-orders by a week or two, giving Valve time to explain the device's technical features properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-frame-a-considerable-step-forward">Steam Frame: A Considerable Step Forward</h2>



<p>The announcement of the long-rumored new Valve headset, previously codenamed <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-vr-headset-valve-might-have-entered-production/">"Deckard,"</a> is likely going to be the focus of this possible set of announcements. If its rumored features are true, the Steam Frame represents a fundamental step up from the Index headset, and a significant change in VR philosophy for the company.</p>



<p>According to leaks, the Steam Frame will introduce <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Frames,"</em> which are visual elements like floating windows that give the user a new way to interact with applications, similar in concept to the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-benefiting-other-companies-in-niche-market/">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s immersive OS. The "Frames" feature is rumored to be backed up by the specifications below.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Rumored Technical Specifications (Based on Proof of Concept)</th></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Display:</strong> 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Features:</strong> SLAM tracking, eye tracking</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-new-steam-controller-and-capsense-feature">The New Steam Controller and Capsense Feature</h2>



<p>The headset announcement is expected could be accompanied by other hardware reveals, including a new Steam Controller. While an image of the new device hasn't been shared (Brad Lynch shared an AI-made mockup to protect his source), the controller is said to sport a capsense feature similar to the Index controllers, but without full finger tracking.</p>



<p>This capsense feature will allow the device to detect how far the user's hands are from the handle, which could have some interesting applications in terms of comfort and immersion. The lack of full finger tracking shouldn't significantly impact the experience, allowing the company to keep the controller's price as low as possible.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p><p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p><p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-could-be-the-steam-frame-s-killer-app">Half-Life 3 Could be the Steam Frame's Killer App</h2>



<p>Even if you are not interested in Valve's upcoming hardware, the rumored announcements set for this week carry immense weight due to the potential software reveal.</p>



<p>With the<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"> HLX project (rumored to be Half-Life 3) having reportedly recently entered a polishing phase</a> , the announcement of the Steam Frame could be accompanied by the reveal of the next entry in the legendary series. Much like Valve did with the Index and Half-Life: Alyx, the new major hardware launch could be tied to the announcement of a game that many had lost hope it would ever see the light of day. Although datamined information suggests the new entry in the series won't be a VR-only game, its reveal would transform this hardware launch into Valve's most significant event since 2019, making this Wednesday essential viewing for any fan of the popular company.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are planning to release some DLC for the action RPG by March 2026. That's according the latest financial report of FromSoft parent company Kadokawa, which has attached a window to the add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s promo material had already hinted would be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Call out to the people who're deep in the night of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Nightreign's last addition</a> so they hear. Tell them to scrabble around for a light switch so they can read the info. Remind them not to accidentally fondle a big boss as they paw along the walls. Actually, I'm sure they'll remember that anyway, since it's s-oh no.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'll have to start without them. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar</a>, flip to page 16 of the <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">report's presentation</a>, which covers the six month period that ended on September 30th.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware is currently developing ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN DLC (planned for release in FY2025), ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," reads the future outlook section. While it'd be cool if The Duskbloods does end up migrating from Switch to PC in time, the Nightreign DLC's the only bit of that which is relevant to us PC folks right now.</p>
<p>Kadokawa's 2024 fiscal year ended on March 31st this year, so we can expect this Nightreign DLC out by March 31st, 2026. That's assuming everything goes to plan, with the company leaving some delay wiggle room here.</p>
<p>As to what'll be in the DLC, extra playable Nightfarers and bosses seem pretty certain. Beyond that, things get a bit more mysterious, especially given the potential for FromSoftware to lean on bosses from previous Souls games. Given the DLC has a bit more riding on it than the likes of that free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">Deep of the Night update</a>, I'd be fairly surprised not to see new locales or modes to further spice up the loop of killing whichever new bosses arrive alongside some new boss-beater.</p><p>Maybe they'll add in a map based around Newcastle city centre, and the new bosses are large black-and-white-shirted revellers who bellow 'toon' whenever you get close. You could stick a poison swamp next to Eldon Square, it'd be brill. That's what my fingers are crossed for as the wait for next March begins.</p>

			<p>It makes me so happy to know that the Tales of 30th Anniversary project is a thing. For such a prolific JRPG franchise, so many of the games are either inaccessible on modern hardware, exclusive to Japan, or both. Seeing Bandai Namco put such a serious foot forward in remastering multiple classic entries in the series is incredible, and even more so considering the great entries they’ve chosen to remaster so far.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review/">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>&nbsp;earlier this year was a delight, and now it’s being followed up by&nbsp;Tales of Xillia Remastered – a gorgeous PS3-era chapter in the series that I finally get a chance to dig deeper into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Xillia Remastered - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd0VM2d3JNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While seeing this game’s cover while browsing game shops always piqued my curiosity, back in the day, it never made its way into my collection, so I dived into this remaster blind. The game opens with what is probably the most unfairly skewed protagonist choice I’ve encountered in a game. You’re shown two brief cutscenes, and then asked to pick which character from those scenes you want to continue the story of – Milla or Jude. The problem is that Milla’s scene is pretty vague, showing her sitting in a temple and muttering something about “the spirits leaving” before attacking a ghostly snake and walking away. Jude, meanwhile, immediately presented me with the most fascinating story setup I’ve ever seen in a traditional JRPG. He’s a busy med-student in a huge, bustling medical school – the idea of a medical school in the middle of a fantastical JRPG world of swords and magic immediately lit up my eyes.</p>



<p>I was quick to choose Jude, but the other wrinkle with this choice is that it ultimately doesn’t alter the game all that much. Jude and Milla’s paths intertwine early on, and they end up spending a vast majority of Tales of Xillia Remastered adventuring together as they try to restore the balance between modern society and the ancient mana that fuels it all. The two heroes split up from time to time, but only for brief moments, so while the solo scenes I got with Jude were incredible, I never felt like I was missing any important information by not witnessing what Milla was up to in those moments.</p>

<p>Despite originally being a PS3 game, Tales of Xillia Remastered is downright gorgeous. The game already had breath-taking visual design, with vividly colored environments and beautifully modelled characters, and the smooth frame rate and upgraded resolution of this remaster only serves to further elevate those already incredible visuals. It doesn’t totally register as a modern game, though – a lot of cutscene animations are a little stiff in that classic way. Still, I think there’s a lot of charm to that, and it’s nice to be able to experience a game from it’s era but bundled with the quality of life you’d expect from a modern release.</p>

<p>Combat in the Tales series has always been a highlight for me, and Tales of Xillia Remastered is no slouch in that department. The real-time combo-heavy battles here are a blast, and I really enjoy the more open-ended approach to upgrades and skill progression this game has. There’s a huge emphasis on using skill points to unlock new ablities across a massive web of upgrades, and you can approach it in any order you like. On top of giving you more freedom to customize a single characters build, the character-link system in this game lets certain characters chain together their Artes mid-battle meaning that customising your crew to synergise properly is really important. That link system also adds a sort of rhythm-game quality to combat that I adored. Timing and flow are key, but your AI partners will trigger their linked abilities automatically, meaning it’s less of a mechanical or input-heavy challenge and more about focus and smart character swapping.</p>
<p>While the amount of bonus costume content and customizable soundtrack options packed into Tales of Xillia Remastered are a treat, one bonus I wish was handled differently is the Grade Shop. This is a menu that lets you redeem points to unlock cheat-code enhancers for your playthrough to increase money gained, XP gained, double damage, and more boosts of the sort. These are fun tools to use for making subsequent playthroughs or challenging sections of the game a breeze, but the issue here is that this is the very first thing you see upon starting a new playthrough. Without any context for the game or time spent playing it, it feels weird to be presented with this massive cheat menu, especially when so many of them warn that they can’t be disabled once applied. I would have appreciated this menu being tucked away somewhere in the actual game, and not so front-loaded.</p>

<p>Despite that Grade Shop hiccup, Tales of Xillia Remastered is an incredible game and a wonderful remaster. It only makes me more excited to see which entries in the series get this treatment next, because so far, Bandai Namco has done an incredible job of giving these nearly-forgotten JRPGs a second lease at life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Halo Studios has confirmed that Halo: Infinite will receive one final update next week, after which the team will move on. The primary goal will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the 2001 game's campaign, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and slated for launch next year. However, the developers have confirmed that there are actually multiple Halo projects in development; <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, they might be remaking the campaigns of the second and third installments while also working on the next mainline entry.</p>



<p>The final Halo: Infinite update, titled Operation: Infinite, is scheduled to go live on November 18. To begin with, the developers are giving a 2x boost to the earning rate for both Career Rank and Spartan Points (SP) across all matchmaking playlists. This will make it easier to reach the max level and unlock the coveted Mark VI armor kit, the same one worn by the Master Chief in the game's campaign.</p>



<p>The update also introduces a free 100-tier Operation Pass and a 100-tier Premium Pass, both with no expiration date planned. The free Pass unlocks three new armor sets (Serpin, Seeker, Adamant), as well as coatings, visors, and stances. The Premium Pass, on the other hand, lets players unlock five additional unique armor sets (Artificer, Seedwarden, Kobold, Phoenix, First Vanguard), six weapon models, and over thirty exclusive customizations. Instant unlocks for the Premium tier include the Charged Quill Shock Rifle model and Phoenix Gold weapon coating.</p>



<p>Halo Studios also added over 200 never-before-released customization items to The Exchange, such as armor pieces, attachments, coatings, charms, and visors. Items from all previous Operations, Events, and Fractures will be available here alongside commemorative Halo 5: Guardians bundles.</p>



<p>A new festive map called Yuletide will be found in the Quick Play playlist, and a new asymmetrical map, Vacancy, is being added to the Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, Ranked Doubles, and select ranked rotational playlists.
