            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-1-update-5-1-1-out-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hello Games has released a new patch for its latest major No Man’s Sky update, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-adds-major-world-improvements/">Worlds Part 1,</a> addressing issues raised by the community. The update addresses issues such as players becoming invisible, worlds becoming infested which destroyed settlements, and crash issues related to planet rendering.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part I Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7-9Bf47yfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issues that caused the player to become invisible after jumping and shooting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the player to be positioned 50m off the ground when riding some synthetic lifeforms.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused some planets to become infested, resulting in a loss of any settlements on that world, and in minor terrain shifts. The infested status of planets has been restored to how it was pre-Worlds. Newly infested planets will become un-infested, and previously infested planets will be restored as such.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to planetary rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare rendering crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a rendering hang.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Worlds Part 1 update is a near universal refresh for No Man’s Sky. The overhaul of water and cloud rendering has been comprehensive. Water now operates on a mesh system, enabling the creation of more realistic waves and foam, while cloud coverage in the sky differs between planets and respond to weather conditions. Rain will not occur without sufficient cloud cover, and wind patterns and storm effects on flora and fauna will be more true-to-life.. The variety of skies, influenced by the colours of day and night, will reflect the unique atmosphere of each planet. The universe of No Man’s Sky is now sprinkled with new frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive, and toxic worlds.</p>
<p>Hello Games will continue to update No Man’s Sky, addressing bugs and also work on the development of Worlds Part 2, as well as<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/hello-games-light-no-fire/"> the procedural adventure game Light No Fire.</a></p>

			<p>Play by Play Studios is a brand-new the-world gaming studio created by studio veterans such as Scott Probst, former GM of Visceral Games, Mike Young, former Creative Director on Madden, and Art Director Terry Smith, who worked on the first God of War as an AD. As of today, they are coming out of the woodwork to announce their first game to be released.</p>
<p>The first game to be developed by Play by Play Studios is The Run: Got Next. In this game, you play 3v3 basketball, and you can either play solo or online with friends and other competitors. Dripping in street hoop culture, this game features fast-paced decision-making where you can either be a mediocre basketballer or become "the G.O.A.T."</p>
<p>The game has yet to receive a full release date, but it is planned for sometime in 2025. Its cartoonish art style is full of vibrancy and excitement, and players can try out signature dunks, tricks, monster blocks, and more.</p>
<p>As listed on the official Steam page, "multiplayer meets roguelike," as the difficulty scales with the matches, and there are modifiers that can make or break your perfect basketball streak. Court conditions, modifiers, and drops can impact how your game pans out, and every single run you undertake is different.</p>
<p>The Run: Got Next features a stylized look to each court that you can play on, with some of them being the most famous and popular basketball courts across the globe. The characters, courts, and all of the movements are hand-keyed animations, giving the game a tremendous amount of love and care put into it. The game is entirely hand-crafted, with every pixel of the game being unique to the players.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2866670/The_Run_Got_Next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The teaser trailer</a> introduces players to three playable characters from The Run: Got Next. They all have unique moves and stylized dunks to add a bit of flair. Even in just the three characters showcased, there is a ton of variety, and it gives players a glimpse at the potential for a fun but chaotic adventure on the basketball court.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, The War Within, is right around the corner, and it's looking to build on the success of Blizzard's back-to-basics approach for 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-dragonflight-review-who-says-you-cant-go-home/1900-6418011/" data-ref-id="1900-6418011">Dragonflight</a>. That means a focus on evergreen features that will persist for years to come in The War Within, the first chapter in a three-expansion trilogy Blizzard has dubbed The Worldsoul Saga.</p><p dir="ltr">Two of The War Within's biggest additions, Warbands and Hero Talents, are great examples of Blizzard's current approach. Rather than entirely new features, each system is instead building on what came before. Warbands is the full realization of all the alt-character-friendly changes and account-wide unlocks that have slowly made their way into the game over the past few years and that became even more of a focus in Dragonflight. Hero Talents, meanwhile, are an expansion of the well-received class Talent tree revamp introduced in Dragonflight, which itself was a throwback to the Talent trees from the game's earliest days.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within Cinematic Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">On paper, iterations on existing WoW features don't quite sound like game-changing, back-of-the-box additions that sell expansions, much less the expansion that will kick off a storyline that is intended to serve as the culmination of WoW's first two decades. But any WoW player with multiple characters will tell you how exciting, and transformative, a feature like Warbands will be to the long-running MMORPG. That enthusiasm applies to Hero Talents as well, as the feature will finally allow players to live out class fantasies like becoming a Dark Ranger as a Hunter or engaging in mounted combat as a Rider of the Apocalypse Death Knight.</p><p dir="ltr">With the arrival of Warbands alongside the game's The War Within pre-patch (which goes live today), gone will be farming reputation or renown on multiple characters. Currencies will be able to be moved freely between characters. Players will finally be able to add various weapon and armor appearances to their account regardless of whether the class they are using at the time is able to use those items. Warbands will display characters across realms on the game's login screen. It will also allow for the transferring of items between characters on the same account regardless of realm, thanks to additions like the Warband bank. Even on just a visual level, having characters on a player's account displayed all together, as opposed to being separated by which server they housed on, is a welcome change.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW is finally becoming a simpler and more-seamless experience for those who have multiple characters spread across multiple realms and factions. It's a big change--one that started to come together in earnest as Dragonflight shipped--said WoW principal software engineer Peter Hodge in a recent interview with GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there really was a genuine desire to keep pushing," Hodge said. "Dragonflight had a lot of really great improvements to evergreen systems and a lot of quality-of-life things…We wanted to continue that philosophy. What else is there in World of Warcraft that is due for a fresh look? We certainly get feedback all the time that those quality-of-life things around making playing alts easier or access to account-wide features, [so they were] definitely very high on the list… It feels about the right time to bring a lot of those ideas under one umbrella of a feature."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337302-wowwarbandui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337302-wowwarbandui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337302"></a><figcaption>Warbands enable account-wide progression across characters, displayed all together on a new character select screen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337302-wowwarbandui.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Such an undertaking wasn't exactly simple, however. WoW is a 20-year-old game, and even if many elements of its underlying code are newer, it's still a massive and complex undertaking to make fundamental changes to how characters, items, and accounts have always worked.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reality is, especially when you're dealing with something like the inventory, you're dealing with bits and pieces of that or features of that which have a very long history," Hodge said. "None of it was written with the idea of 'Hey, what if this was account-wide?' No one thought about that when they were laying down the foundations of the inventory code 20 years ago or longer. That certainly becomes one of the biggest challenges from an engineering perspective."</p><p dir="ltr">For Hero Talents, which aren't coming with The War Within's pre-patch but will be part of the expansion proper, it was a different sort of challenge: how to expand the well-received the Talent tree system from Dragonflight without overwhelming players with choices or complexity. It's for that reason Blizzard decided on the idea of 10 additional Talent points able to be invested in a single separate tree, with each specialization able to choose between two of each class's three new Hero Talent trees. At max level, players will have the entirety of their chosen Hero Talent tree unlocked, as opposed to the normal class Talent trees, where players are forced to make some choices about their build and don't have enough Talent points for everything. George Velev, a producer on WoW, said the team liked having a "definitive package" for each Hero Talent tree.</p><p dir="ltr">"We find that the current Talent tree offers a lot of options for players entirely, adding 10 more options; 10 more points you had to pick between probably felt like it was skirting a little bit too much towards too complex," Velev said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though each Hero Talent tree does feature some choice nodes where players pick between two abilities, the fact that each Talent tree is largely the same across all players of that spec makes each easier to fine-tune and balance, Velev said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every Sunfury Fire Mage is going to have these 10, give or take a few choice nodes, for their kit," Velev said. "So we fundamentally know we can balance that against Spellslinger or that against Frostfire. That gives us a lot of tools in our arsenal for making sure when you do come to a decision of 'should I play X or Y,' it's more of a focus on the thematics and fantasy and what appeals to you instead of just picking between what's stronger and what's weaker."</p><p dir="ltr">That "class fantasy" of each Hero Talent tree is a big part of the appeal. Some of the new Talents draw on existing archetypes for many of the Hero Talent specializations. Hunters will be able to follow in the footsteps of Sylvanas as a Dark Ranger, while Monks will have the option of embracing the teachings of Pandaria's Shado-Pan. Other Talents put an emphasis on less-explored aspects of a particular class, like exploring the prophecy side of Priests or the ancestral-spirit ideas present in Shaman lore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337300-wowwarwithinherotalents.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337300" data-ratio="0.56253505328099" data-width="1783" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337300-wowwarwithinherotalents.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337300"></a><figcaption>Each class specialization will be able to choose between two Hero Talent trees.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4337300-wowwarwithinherotalents.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Many of the Hero Talent specs that pull from existing lore are also rooted in a particular faction or group. Warrior's Mountain Thane Hero Talent tree, for example, is a dwarven archetype, but one that will be usable by all Fury and Protection Warriors, not just dwarves. It was a design challenge that took a lot of time and brainstorming to get right, Velev said.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the most part, we went with what felt most appropriate for the class," Velev said. "Yes, there are a lot that are sort of faction-specific, but we tried to avoid a lot of faction connotations. We know a lot of players don't want to play something that's very Horde or very Alliance, in which case we tried to make sure that's not the only option for them. But we also didn't completely remove stuff that felt too faction-specific from the table entirely because at the end of the day, Dark Ranger Hunter is super cool. Yes, it's a little bit Horde-oriented but just because it's Horde-oriented doesn't mean we should give up on that approach or that direction."</p><p dir="ltr">Hero Talents have drawn some criticism from players over the fact that the idea of playing as a Dark Ranger might be the best option for their class specialization, but might not fit their particular class fantasy. The opposite is also true; a player may have always really loved the idea of being a Dark Ranger and all that entails, but the spec in theory might not be optimal for specific types of endgame content, discouraging them from playing the spec. Velev said the team wants players to feel like they can swap Hero specs should one tree perform better than another at a specific type of content. He also said that Hero Talents are an evergreen feature and that balance changes and iteration will continue into The War Within and beyond.</p><p dir="ltr">"What we want to avoid is every single time you play your Hunter you feel like you can't play Dark Ranger at all," Velev said. "There are trees that are optimized for specific scenarios and that's sweet. That's awesome. But feeling like you can never play what you want to play… That's something we're trying to avoid. And that's why we have things like you get every single Talent point, so we can have more opportunities to make sure they are as tightly balanced as possible."</p><p dir="ltr">While every expansion is a major turning point for WoW, The War Within in particular feels like a fundamental change for the MMO. One prominent WoW content creator has gone as far to call the expansion's upcoming pre-patch <a href="https://youtu.be/yB1SsRGaMMk?si=7dPNZuUcvNB7ts5_" rel="nofollow ">"the most important Warcraft patch ever."</a> That might be a little clickbaity, but there is truth in the fact that once the account-wide systems that make up Warbands are unleashed, there's no going back. WoW will fundamentally be played differently come The War Within. The changes have been a long time coming (one might even call them overdue), but it seems as if Blizzard is finally keeping pace with how its players consume WoW in the modern age, doubling down on the idea that players want to play more characters, not fewer.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot more players play a lot more characters than they did in the dawn of World of Warcraft," Hodge said. "That's been a gradual change over time. That was definitely a big part of the reason why we thought 'Hey, we need to be looking more at making this easier for players.' Certainly, as an outcome, as a goal, if we get more players trying more classes in World of Warcraft…if we can provide more options and excitement for players to jump into more alts, for me that will be a win."</p><p dir="ltr">WoW: The War Within launches on August 26. Those who purchase the game's $90 Epic or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-collectors-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6522721/">20th Anniversary Collector's Edition</a> will be able to play three days earlier on August 23. The War Within pre-patch, which adds Warbands and Skyriding for most flying mounts (another feature iterated on from Dragonflight), is live today.</p>

            <p>
Amid of swirl of rumours suggesting Microsoft was prepping more Call of Duty for an imminent Xbox Game Pass release, the company has confirmed last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will join on its subscription service this Wednesday, 24th July.
</p>
<p>
As per Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/23/modern-warfare-3-coming-to-game-pass-july-24/">announcement</a>, Game Pass subscribers will have access to all Modern Warfare 3 modes, meaning its single-player campaign, multiplayer, and open-world Zombies.
</p>
<p>
Modern Warfare 3 is only the second <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> title to hit Game Pass since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the company</a> last year, with Diablo 4 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">launched for the subscription service</a> back in March. It's not the only announced Activision title for Game Pass, of course; this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">available to subscribers</a> when it arrives on 24th October.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Newscast: Does the loss of day one launches make Xbox Game Pass pointless?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEc8ghseTIk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Or rather, it'll be available to <em>some</em> Game Pass subscribers in October, given Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">recent overhaul</a> of the service. As of 12th September, Game Pass' basic catalogue tier - now known as Xbox Game Pass Standard - will no longer provide access to first-party and other titles on launch day. That benefit will instead only be available to subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, with all tiers getting a price increase.
</p>
<p>
Modern Warfare 3's imminent Game Pass arrival is presumably timed to get as many new subscribers onboard ahead of September's price hike in the hope they'll stick around. Whether or not this particular Call of Duty will do the trick remains to be seen - Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell didn't think much of it last year, calling it an "exercise in extracting value from its players rather than providing it" and "what happens when this industry is at its worst", in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review">two star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-roadmap-officially-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA Sports WRC, also known as EA WRC, is a highly popular racing game and holds the license of the World Rally Championship, which allows them to make these games. Developed by Codemasters, EA Sports WRC is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-tech-q-no-plans-to-add-lumen-or-nanite/">the Codemasters first rally game</a> to have the official WRC license. Released in November 2023, EA has officially released the roadmap for EA Sports WRC, so that players and fans of the game can see what they should expect.</p>
<p>A new season expansion has officially been confirmed for October 2024, adding plenty more content to the game. The expansion is set to include "new locations, rally stages, high-performance vehicles, liveries, and more." Fascinatingly, those who purchase the season expansion for EA Sports WRC 2024 will also go on to receive two more additional DLC packs post-launch.</p>
<p>Along with the season expansion, players can purchase the EA Sports WRC 2024 Season Edition, a one-time purchase of both the base game and the three incoming DLCs for a fixed price.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/2024-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the blog post</a> for the EA Sports WRC roadmap, EA expands on that and says that a further season expansion will be released in Winter 2024, with the other being released in Spring 2025. Those who purchase the season expansion will receive the other two DLCs at no extra cost. Alternatively, those who don't own the expansion can purchase the DLCs individually.</p>
<p>The blog post for the WRC road map also confirms the introduction of the Season 6 Rally Pass, which begins on July 30. Utilizing player feedback, the developers have made the Rally Pass more reasonable, allowing players to unlock liveries for cars outside the WRC. With the new Rally Pass, Moments are also returning to the game. The Rally Pass will be entirely free for players to utilize and try to unlock all of the rewards available.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting points of the blog post is the reveal of esports WRC. While it is still in development, the blog post says, "We're almost ready to share the official competition information and event calendar as we continue to work with our partners on the finer details of the series."</p>
<p>While the details haven't been released yet, they say to stay tuned to their social media accounts, where you will find out the latest information regarding the online qualifiers that are to be held via RaceNet, and a later in-person final race where players will compete for the title of esports WRC World Champion. The races will have a variety of challenges and locations for players to compete in, and they all have to use Rally1 cars to compete.</p>

<p>Play by Play Studios has announced its new basketball game, The Run: Got Next. The game comes from a studio featuring numerous former EA developers, including former general manager Scott Probst, Madden creative director Mike Young, and more.</p>



<p>The game is being touted as a spiritual success to the NBA Street franchise of the early-to-mid 2000s. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Run: Got Next - Official Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vmq1zu8u0OU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“There was a lot of us that worked on NBA Street that always wanted to bring it back. I think it is difficult for a company that has a game like a Madden or an NBA Live that is so big. If you’re putting all your resources to that, I think it was challenging to think about a secondary game,” Young told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-street-the-run-got-next-unreal-engine-5-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p>



<p>“Introducing&nbsp;The Run: Got Next&nbsp;– a character-driven, full court 3v3 hoops game that celebrates the attitude, style and skills of streetball culture,” the <a href="https://playbyplaystudios.com/news/introducing-the-run-got-next" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s description reads</a>. “Bring your squad to some of the most legendary street courts around the world and see how long you can go on a Run.”</p>



<p>In a welcome note <a href="https://playbyplaystudios.com/news/welcome-to-play-by-play-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the studio’s website</a>, Probst says that the goal of the studio is to bring fun back to sports games in a way that doesn’t exist anymore.</p>



<p>“As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience – that sucks,” he said. </p>



<p>“I’ve found this myself in many sports games today where I feel like I have to grind hundreds of hours to be good, I have to pay hundreds of dollars (on top of the $70 I already spent for the game itself) to have an ok time, and I have to go out on random quests to do things that don’t really have anything to do with the fun of the game or the sport.”</p>



<p>The Run: Got Next launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

        <p><em>Modern Warfare III</em>‘s multiplayer offers crisp and responsive gameplay across a bevy of maps and modes. All the classic maps from the original <em><a title="Games > Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a></em> (2009) make their return, but with new gameplay improvements that players have become accustomed to over the years. This, in addition to the large-scale Invasion and Ground War maps and four seasons’ worth of post-launch maps and updates, means that you’ll be getting an incredible amount of content right from the jump. There’s never been a better time to hop into the fray!</p><p>Player progression has evolved as well, with new and familiar Perks, Killstreaks and Equipment to unlock. Each level builds you into a stronger and more tactically diverse operator, giving you more options on the battlefield. In addition to your usual weapons and attachments, MWIII also introduces After-Market Parts, allowing you to further customize your weapons. And if you’ve played MWII multiplayer, MWIII allows you to transfer much of your content and weapon progression with its Carry Forward feature.</p><p><strong>Explore the Dark Aether</strong></p><p>Prepare to fight and survive against hordes of zombies in the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever! In this co-op PvE extraction mode, you and your squad drop into the outskirts of an infested Urzikstan as a part of Operation: Deadbolt. As you complete contracts, raid strongholds and venture further into the map, the zombies you encounter will grow stronger and more relentless. The best loot and darkest secrets hide in these higher-tier areas, but you will still need to safely exfiltrate if you hope to keep your gear and fight another day. Luckily, you’ll have access to many classic Zombies upgrades including Perk-a-Colas, Ammo-Mods, the Pack-a-Punch machine and (if you’re lucky) the powerful and infamous Wonder Weapons.</p><p>However, there are more than just zombies roaming this infested area. The mercenaries of Terminus Outcomes have set up bases around Urzikstan along with their elite Warlords. Oh, and have we mentioned the special zombies and bosses?

		<p>EA Sports WRC players can now see what EA has in store for the next year, as it has revealed the content roadmap. The key highlight is the Season 6 Rally Pass, which launches July 30th, bringing rewards of helmets, suits, gloves, and vehicle liveries. And for the first time, there will be liveries for vehicle classes outside of WRC. The Season 6 Rally Pass will run from July to September.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS WRC - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JFy_cWefBtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Accompanying the Season 6 Rally Pass will be the 2024 WRC Esports Championship, with online events being added for players to compete in. The most successful will face off against each other in an in-person final. Online qualifiers will take place <a href="https://racenet.com/ea_sports_wrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Racenet,</a> but further details are to be confirmed on what online events will take place, and when.</p>

<p>In October, the WRC 24 Season Expansion will be available to purchase, adding two new locations, rally stages, liveries and vehicles. The expansion will also grant access to two future DLC packs, the first of which will launch in the winter and the second will be made available in the spring. Both DLC packs will contain more cars and additional rally stages in already available locations.</p>

<p><em>“The 2024 WRC Expansion ensures our game content remains fresh, allowing players to advance their careers with the introduction of two thrilling locations, more vehicles, and expanded customisation options,”</em> said Matthew Battison, Creative Director at Codemasters.<em> “The free Season 6 Rally Pass gives players more reasons to jump back into the game ahead of our major plans for later in the year.”</em></p>

<p>In our EA Sports WRC review, Dom said, <em>“If you’re looking for a fully featured and great handling rally game, EA Sports WRC is the undisputed champion this year, though PC players need to be aware that some technical bugs still need to be ironed out.”</em></p>

I mean, sure, it’s one thing to see other players questing in the open world, but do you have to <em>talk</em> with them? Maybe even <em>play</em> with them? Is there a class you can pick in <em>FF14</em> that minimizes how much you have to interact with others?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194907" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Diablo IV" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="194907,194141,193627" data-current="194907"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Diablo IV</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194907/194907_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20346.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There’s good news for those of us who like to run solo: You don’t need to worry about picking certain classes over others if you plan to play alone. All classes will offer a great experience whether you play solo or with others. While dungeons and boss battles are designed for groups of players, the game will automatically match you up with others via the Duty Finder system. <em>FF14</em> also lets you use NPC companions in almost all its leveling dungeons. These NPCs can cover defense, offense, and healing. In other words, you don’t have to worry about picking a class that can tough it out on its own; <strong>every class and job is solo-viable throughout the entire main story quest.</strong></p><p>For reference, I’m a mostly solo player and play the Astrologian Job. This Job primarily buffs and heals other players. I’ve never felt held back by my choice of class, even though it might seem like a class meant to support other players. In other words, <strong>new players should pick whichever class they find most appealing, regardless of whether they’ll play solo or with friends</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>FF14</em> also offers some optional challenges for solo players to chase. In these specific instances, some classes and jobs will give you an edge over others</strong>. If that sounds interesting to you, then consider playing some of the classes and Jobs listed below.</p><h2 id="h127124"><a id="best"></a>The best solo class in <em>Final Fantasy 14</em></h2><p><strong>Classes in <em>FF14 </em>strictly refer to roles you can pick at level 1</strong>. These will all turn into “Jobs” after completing their respective questlines. And while you can pick any class and have a great time, there is a particular one that is a little better for first-time solo players. </p><h3 id="h127125"><a id=""></a>Marauder</h3><figure id="" data-id="fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-recommend-id="image://fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Marauder leaps into the air while wielding an enormous ax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Marauder leaps into the air while wielding an enormous ax." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-recommend-id="image://fcb45434d9fbed7ec3c78963bac2f3ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Marauder leaps into the air while wielding an enormous ax." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Marauders don’t necessarily outperform other classes from level 1, but they still hold their own in the early game. These ax wielders are Tanks, which means they’re designed to grab the attention of enemies away from your party members and take hits in their stead. For solo players just starting out, this is a nice perk. Your naturally high defense and HP will cushion you if you accidentally get in over your head against high level monsters all by yourself.</p><p>After you level up Marauder enough to unlock the Warrior Job, you’ll find that you’re so bulky it’s almost like you don’t need other players. The cooldown skills Thrill of Battle and Equilibrium provide powerful self-healing, reducing your need to rely on other players to heal you. </p><p>At level 56, Warriors unlock Raw Intuition, a skill with a 25-second cooldown that heals you whenever you hit an enemy. So the next time you find yourself trapped in a mob of six enemies who are all attacking you, you can just use some area-of-effect attacks after using Raw Intuition and watch your health climb back to full in a matter of seconds.</p><p><strong>The Warrior’s incredible self-healing makes it a top choice when trying to solo bosses from past expansions</strong>. The Warrior’s high health also comes in handy in group content,since you won’t need to count on healers to keep you alive as often as other characters. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcZCEny4x4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcZCEny4x4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Job is even capable of soloing level-equivalent 8-player encounters</a></span> .</p><p>For those interested in Marauder/Warrior, Gunbreaker<strong> </strong>is another Tank job that has seen notable success in the Heaven on High deep dungeon (more on this later). What’s more, Tank jobs equip the same armor, so you can jump between them easily. Sadly, Gunbreaker is not currently available in the free trial.</p><h2 id="h127126"><a id="jobs"></a>The best Jobs in <em>Final Fantasy 14 for solo play</em></h2><p><em>FF14</em> also contains “Advanced jobs,” which you can unlock after either reaching a certain level threshold or crossing a specific milestone in the main story quest. These Jobs don’t have preceding classes, so you can play them as soon as you can unlock them. Aspiring solo players should check out the jobs below.</p><h3 id="h127127"><a id=""></a>Red Mage</h3><figure id="" data-id="c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-recommend-id="image://c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-recommend-id="image://c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unlock requirement</strong>: Reach level 50 and complete the quest Taking the Red in Ul’Dah.</p><p>For longtime <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans, the Red Mage’s place here should come as no surprise. It’s traditionally a jack-of-all-trades job in the series’ canon, and that’s generally true here. The <em>FF14</em> incarnation of Red Mage is a magic DPS class, meaning its primary function is to cast long-range magic spells to inflict damage. However, there are two specific reasons why Red Mage appeals to solo players.</p><p>Red Mage’s first major perk is mobility. Spell casters in <em>FF14</em> typically need to stay in one spot to attack, relying on short windows between spells to dodge attacks without decreasing their DPS. Meanwhile, Red Mages have the Dualcast trait, letting them cast every other spell instantly. Red Mages can also build a gauge that lets them use powerful melee attacks that lack any sort of cast time. Combine these abilities with the Corps-a-corps<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Displacement abilities, which lets Red Mages leap towards and away from enemies respectively, and you get a class that can easily counter enemy mechanics and dodge attacks.High mobility isn’t exclusive to Red Mage, but what <em>is</em> exclusive is the spell Vercure. In a vacuum, Vercure is a basic curing spell that’s inferior to anything a dedicated Healer can use. However,<strong> </strong>Vercure is the best on-demand healing spell learned by any DPS class in the game. Other DPS classes have defensive and healing options on a cooldown, but Red Mages can reliably heal themselves as long as they have enough Magic Points.</p><p>The Red Mage’s mix of offense and healing makes it a comfortable job for players who don’t want to rely on friends to help them out<strong>.</strong> As an added bonus, Red Mage is one of the best jobs to play if you plan to defeat <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKGyO0ieU4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKGyO0ieU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rare solo bosses in the Bozjan Southern Front</a></span>. </p><p>For new players interested in Red Mage, consider starting out as the Arcanist class. In the early game, Arcanist feels remarkably like the Red Mage, since it learns both ranged magic attacks and basic healing magic. Additionally, if you choose to promote yourself from the Arcanist class to the Summoner job, you can carry over almost all your gear to Red Mage upon unlocking it..</p><h3 id="h127128"><a id=""></a>Machinist</h3><figure id="" data-id="74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-recommend-id="image://74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-recommend-id="image://74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unlock requirement</strong>: Reach the <em>Heavensward </em>expansion and complete the quest So You Want To Be A Machinist in Foundation.</p><p>Compared to the picks above, Machinist might seem like an odd choice. This Physical RangedDPS Job doesn’t sport on-demand healing or high defense, and its damage output doesn’t compare to melee DPS jobs either. So what makes the Machinist so special?</p><p>First, let’s talk about mobility. Machinist is a Physical Ranged DPS<strong> </strong>Job, which means it can freely move and attack from a distance. <strong>Machinist has no cast times</strong>, and only its situational Flamethrower attack limits its movement. Not only can a Machinist dodge attacks like a champ, it’s one of the only jobs in the game that can kite normal enemies. Kiting (when you run from a mob of enemies pursuing you) is typically discouraged in group content, but it can become a massive boon when playing solo.</p><p>While Bard and Dancer are also Physical Ranged DPS jobs, they derive most of their power from supporting other players. Machinist is more of a “selfish” job as it focuses on dishing out lots of damage on its own. <strong>In a solo environment, the Machinist massively outperforms its Physical Ranged counterparts</strong>.</p><p>Dismantle cuts an enemy’s attack output by 10% for 10 seconds, bolstering the Machinist’s survivability against tough foes. Head Graze can stun targets (invaluable in canceling certain strong attacks), while Leg Graze and Foot Graze<strong> </strong>can control the mobility of common enemies you’ll face. And while it doesn’t affect battle performance, Peloton increases your movement speed while out of combat, which makes running around cities and dungeons a bit faster.</p><p>All of these traits make Machinist one of the best jobs to challenge <strong><em>FF14</em></strong>’s Deep Dungeons. Deep Dungeons are roguelike-style challenges that task players with clearing upwards of 200 randomized levels filled with traps and monsters. While these are primarily designed with parties of four in mind, players can earn some of the rarest achievements in the entire game by clearing a Deep Dungeon by themselves without dying. So if you want to prepare yourself for the most hardcore challenge available to solo players, Deep Dungeons are essential.</p><p>For new players interested in the Machinist, you’ll want to start as the Archer class. An Archer can eventually upgrade to the Bard Job, and while Bard’s personal DPS potential <em>is </em>low, that gap isn’t so pronounced at lower levels. More importantly, Archer/Bard most closely resembles the Machinist’s playstyle of all the starting classes. You can also unlock Machinist as soon as you progress into the <em>Heavensward </em>expansion. Machinist equips the same armor as Bard too!</p><h2 id="h127129"><a id="others"></a>Honorable Mentions: Other Jobs worth considering for solo play</h2><p>The Ninja Job–which is derived from the Rogue class–boasts high burst damage and uniquely has the Hide ability that predominantly benefits solo players. </p><p>The Samurai Job is another good pick as it can inflict among the most damage in the game without relying on others . It even has some mitigation built into its kit via the Third Eye<strong> </strong>ability.</p><p>Healers typically don’t thrive in solo environments, but solo players might feel more comfortable knowing they can heal themselves on demand. Conjurer–which up-classes into the White Mage Job–is one of the better healer roles for players that plan to undertake solo content. </p><p>Sage is also relatively solo friendly, though unlocking this job does require the <em>Endwalker </em>expansion (alongside a hefty prerequisite of hitting level 70 first).</p><hr><p>Solo players in <em>FF14</em> have a lot of great options when it comes to picking a class or Job. Ultimately, you should main the job you enjoy playing most in <em>FF14</em>, regardless of whether you’re a solo player or not. <em>FF14</em> also lets you easily switch between classes and Jobs as well, so feel free to experiment with different roles and see which ones stick with you. Whether you intend to challenge bosses and Deep Dungeons by yourself in <em>FF14 </em>or wind up getting distracted by fishing, enjoy your time in Eorzea!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m <em>this</em> close to absolutely adoring this assortment of timed challenges from NES games. In many ways, it feels like it’s designed precisely for NES sickos like me, folks who have an enduring fondness not just for well-regarded classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>and <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>but also for the rougher, more frustrating first-party games on Nintendo’s first console, like <em>Ice Climber</em>. But one huge, glaring flaw holds it back, relegating it to an interesting curiosity rather than the conversation- and competition-driving release it could have been.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196698,196766" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let me start with some of the things I really like about this game. First of all (and least importantly), I think the Deluxe Set Nintendo is selling is quite nice. It comes with a set of pins, postcards featuring the box art of all of the games featured in <em>Championships</em>, and a (strictly ornamental) gold NES cartridge. It’s all Nintendo paying tribute to itself, of course, but it’s a well-made assortment of goodies for a lot less than typical “special edition” prices.</p><p><strong>Order <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmJj05IZkRU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmJj05IZkRU" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-world-championships-nes-edition---deluxe-set---nintendo-switch%2F408781.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-world-championships-nes-edition---deluxe-set---nintendo-switch%2F408781.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fnintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fnintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> </p><p>Now, onto the game itself. <em>Nintendo Championships </em>is essentially a slew of challenges that have you playing moments from classic NES games and trying to achieve a given goal as quickly as possible. These range from really short and simple (grab the sword at the start of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>) to much more challenging (beat <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>), and I think the structure of the game is wonderful. The way it starts out by having you do the simplest things gives you a feel for how important every little movement can be. You learn from experience that valuable milliseconds can be gained or lost in something as basic as the angle of a jump.<br></p><p>In this regard, it feels like a real gateway to the joys of speedrunning. By the time you’re tackling one of the game’s more elaborate challenges that see you completing an entire stage or even an entire game, you intrinsically understand that it’s a matter of putting all the pieces together, trying to pull off every movement as gracefully and effectively as you pulled off the movements in those much smaller challenges you started with. I have probably played World 1-1 of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>hundreds of times over the course of my life, and yet <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> pushed me, for the first time ever, to really focus on completing it as quickly as possible, and it felt like a totally different stage. Simply beating 1-1 is easy as pie. Beating it really quickly and efficiently? That takes practice and determination. Repeatedly, <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>thrilled me by giving me exciting new ways to tackle games that I’ve been intimately familiar with for most of my life, and I suspect that I’ll continue having fun going back to it for some time and trying to improve my rating in some of the game’s many challenges.</p><p>But here’s where we get to the game’s colossal oversight. Do you know what would have made me (and, I suspect, thousands of other players) way more enamored with these challenges, and way more determined to come back to them again and again to improve our times? Leaderboards. Particularly friend leaderboards. Look, if I knew that a pal of mine had picked up the Screw Attack power-up in <em>Metroid </em>.03 seconds faster than I had, you’d better believe I’d be obsessed with doing it again and again until I’d surpassed her time. For me, this game could have been the hottest source of online competition since <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition </em>burst onto Xbox Live way back in 2007. And you know what <em>Pac-Man CE </em>offered on top of leaderboards that helped make it such a competitive sensation? The opportunity to watch replays of your friends’ games, to identify exactly how they’d edged past you to the tune of 125,000 points.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-recommend-id="image://ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Nintendo World Championships clearly stores ghost data, as it’s needed for the game’s survival mode.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-recommend-id="image://ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s absolutely no reason why <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>shouldn’t offer both leaderboards and replays for its challenges. We already know the game stores replay data! One of its modes is called Survival Mode, and it pits you against ghost replays from seven other players in races to complete three challenges. Okay, Nintendo. So you have the damn data. <em>Please</em>, let me watch my friends’ best attempts at completing a loop of <em>Donkey Kong</em>, or beating Mouser in <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>. Speedrunning is as much about cooperation and sharing information as it is about competition, and even if you <em>see </em>how a friend shaved five seconds off their time in a given challenge, you still have to execute the technique. It’s absurd that I have to take to Twitter to share information like this with my friends and fellow players, instead of them just being able to watch my replay in-game.<br></p><p>Obviously, I’m speaking as a die-hard NES fan here, but god, this misstep by Nintendo is so crushing. I really think <em>NWC </em>could have and should have been a game that brought people together and had us enthusiastically competing at its myriad challenges for many weeks. It could have been one of the games of the summer. Instead, because Nintendo failed to implement sensible online features, it’s an experience we can only really enjoy in isolation. It’s an oversight that, to me, is so mind-boggling I can scarcely believe it. I keep expecting Nintendo to announce that they’re patching in support for challenge-specific leaderboards and the ability to watch friends’ replays. But I doubt it will actually happen. This is Nintendo we’re talking about, a company that, for all its brilliance, has frequently been well behind the curve when it comes to knowing what to do with online functionality.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-recommend-id="image://2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Yay, I ranked in the top 58 percent!</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-recommend-id="image://2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br>To be fair, there is ONE online leaderboard in the game, in the appropriately titled World Championships mode. Here, each week, you and players all over the world can compete in a series of five challenges, and once the week is out, you’re shown how you ranked against everyone else. That’s all well and good, but it feels grossly insufficient. I don’t just want to compete against the masses once a week. I want to have a spirited back-and-forth with my closest friends as we each obsessively try to be the fastest to grab the first mushroom in <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>or to beat Ridley in <em>Metroid</em>. God, it’s just so disappointing. My only hope is that the title of this game—<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>—hints that in the future, we may see other entries, a SNES Edition, perhaps an N64 Edition, and so on, and that, by the time those come around, Nintendo decides to add the features this game is so glaringly missing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After weeks of calls from both consumers and even game studios, Intel <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113#M74792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has publicly addressed</a> the instability reports surrounding its 13th and 14th-generation desktop CPU.  </p>



<p>According to the company, elevated operator voltage is causing the problem in “some” desktop processors. Intel says that its analysis shows that the elevated operator voltage is coming from “a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.”</p>



<p>As far as a fix for the issue, Intel is releasing a microcode patch that addresses the cause. The update is currently being targeting for mid-August after “full validation” of its success.</p>



<p>You can read Intel’s full statement below.</p>



<h2 id="h-intel-statement-on-cpu-instability">Intel Statement On CPU Instability</h2>



<p><em>“Based on extensive analysis of Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors returned to us due to instability issues, we have determined that elevated operating voltage is causing instability issues in some 13th/14th Gen desktop processors. Our analysis of returned processors confirms that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.</em></p>



<p><em>“Intel is delivering a microcode patch which addresses the root cause of exposure to elevated voltages. We are continuing validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to Intel regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed. Intel is currently targeting mid-August for patch release to partners following full validation.</em></p>



<p><em>“Intel is committed to making this right with our customers, and we continue asking any customers currently experiencing instability issues on their Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors reach out to Intel Customer Support for further assistance”</em></p>

This time it’s with a selection of cards set in the world of the Monty Python and the Holy Grail. </p><p>Split across two Secret Lair drops, the latest Universes Beyond tie-in will have eight reprints and one token reskinned with references and jokes from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-comedies-of-all-time">classic 1975 film</a>. One drop will have five cards total, one of which is double-faced so you can choose if it’s either an African or European swallow, while the other will have three cards and a token.</p><p>You can <strong>flip through the gallery below to see all the cards in both Monty Python drops</strong>: </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>9 Cards in Secret Lair x Monty Python and the Holy Grail: Vol. 1 &amp; 2</h3></div></output><p>To find out how the heck a crossover like this even comes about, I spoke with Secret Lair Senior Product Designer Daniel Nguyen, who said the first step for many of their Universes Beyond projects is to simply reach out to the representatives for lots of different properties and see who might be interested in working together.</p><p>“This was a really fun one to get,” Nguyen says. ”It’s kind of a funny pairing. They seem like such different ideas, but I think the cards came together really nicely and it’s just very quaint to see on Magic cards.” He also explains that the business folk their outreach team initially gets in touch with don’t always know what Magic even is, but that it’s “fun if someone on the other side actually is a Magic fan, which does happen quite often.”</p><p>While this isn’t the first old movie to get a crossover drop, with The Evil Dead and The Princess Bride both getting Secret Lairs of their own, the jokes within it do feel tailored toward both Holy Grail and Magic in a particularly satisfying way. That’s both in seeing iconic scenes from the movie represented by notable cards that align perfectly (such as, the card Dismember depicting the Black Knight), but also in a few Magic jokes that use the language of Monty Python instead.</p><p>For example, John Cleese’s Tim the Enchanter is represented by the card Prodigal Sorcerer, which is lovingly referred to as “Tim” by much of the Magic community. “That’s just the top line on the document, right? You gotta have that one,” says Nguyen, who jokes “if we don’t do that we’re all fired, clearly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While the designs and thought behind the cards in these drops is impressive, the fact that Vol. 1 has five cards (one of which is double-faced) while Vol 2. only has three cards and token did make me curious about how Wizards of the Coast decides on the contents of each Secret Lair. Nguyen tells me that these decisions are generally more art than science, taking into account a card’s desirability in the playerbase, the bandwidth they have for coordinating artists and other resources, what each individual drop might call for thematically, and more. </p><p>“I take it very seriously,” Nguyen assures me. “We think deeply about everything that goes into these drops. Every aspect you can consider, I’m thinking about that all day long and losing sleep over it sometimes.” He says one part of that is hitting staple cards people are using a lot already, but also balancing that with some tastemaking picks that go off the beaten path when it makes sense, even if the appeal of the latter may be narrower as a result. “Every drop should [have] <em>someone’s </em>favorite card.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We think deeply about everything that goes into these drops.” -<em> Daniel Nguyen, WOTC</em></p></div><p>The Monty Python and the Holy Grail drops will be available in both foil and non-foil starting on July 29 as part of the next Superdrop.
