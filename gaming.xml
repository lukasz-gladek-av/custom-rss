			<p>It's been announced today by Marvel Games and NetEase Games that a special Spring Festival event will be coming to Marvel Rivals. Since its release, this title has been widely successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">title already winning awards</a>. The Spring Festival will be coming to Marvel Rivals on January 23 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT, where a new limited-time game mode will be available for players to participate in.</p>
<p>This game mode is called Clash of Dancing Lions and allows players to participate in a 3v3 on a designated map to try and gain possession of the ball and get it over to the scoring zones that are on either side of the field. The first team to reach the designated score will be the winner of the Clash of Dancing Lions event.</p>
<p>By participating in the Clash of Dancing Lions event in Marvel Rivals, players will be able to get limited-time items such as the Star-Lord: Lion's Mane costume, nameplate, and spray. That is just the tip of the reward iceberg, as there is plenty more to unlock, including a Gallery Card customization event named Fortune &amp; Colors.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from the Marvel Rivals event, you can check out the Spring Festival trailer below, which showcases the Clashing Lions costumes. This includes Star-Lord: Lion's Mane, Iron Fist: Lion's Gaze, and Black Widow: Lion's Heartbeat. These costumes won't all be available to begin with, and will release over the following weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | The Spring Festival Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1ogvqoq09I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, Marvel Rivals will have a special Spider-Man 2 bundle, which comes with the Advanced Suit 2.0, nameplate, and spray, coming on January 30. This is to celebrate the launch of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>
<p>The game has received three patches thus far, with the first season well underway. Players also got to experience Season 0 when the game was first released, which had just under half of the content that Season 1 currently has. Already there are many players flying through the ranks, with the likes of <a href="https://esports.gg/news/marvel-rivals/shroud-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shroud considering creating a Marvel Rivals esports organization</a> because he likes the game so much.</p>
<p>Whether that will come to fruition anytime soon remains to be seen, but as the game continues to remain popular, it's possible that this will become a staple in the esports genre amongst giants like Overwatch 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, for example.</p>

The news was <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019">shared on X</a> and featured a shout out to The Game Awards. </p><p>“To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards">@thegameawards</a>, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it!” the post read. <em>Balatro</em> was featured prominently during The Game Awards, nominated for a number of awards including Game of the Year and winning the best indie, best debut indie, and best mobile categories. </p><p>On X, Wout van Halderen, PR manager for <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, added that the game had sold 3.5 million copies <a href="https://x.com/TheHashtag0nist/status/1881729707521257851">by the first week of December</a>. With The Game Awards taking place the second week in December, the implication is that <em>Balatro</em> received a significant 1.5 million unit bump in sales after being featured during Keighley’s Christmas Commercial telethon. Even more impressive, the 5 million figure is total units sold and doesn’t count the number of downloads the game got for being on the Apple Arcade subscription.</p><p>Since its launch in February, <em>Balatro</em> has quickly become one of the biggest indie hits of 2024. <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">Developed by a single person</a> over the course of two years, the poker roguelike has garnered a reputation for being a well-crafted “number-go-up” game with its developer leaning in on the joke that <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1839702508454687062">it devours players’ free and not-so-free time</a>.</p><div><p>In the 11 months since the game’s release, it’s only gotten small, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278578/balatro-is-getting-more-cards-featuring-other-games">cosmetic</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319769/dont-watch-this-balatro-video">updates</a> but developer LocalThunk has hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">a major gameplay-focused update</a> is forthcoming this year.</p></div><p>Jimbo help us all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a lengthy and complex adventure, and even the early part of the game will throw a lot at you to keep up with. As such, here are some tips for the opening hours of <em>Ender Magnolia</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196766,196452" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h27298"><a id="boxes"></a>Break glowing boxes for materials</h2><figure id="" data-id="9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-recommend-id="image://9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist stands in front of a glowing box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist stands in front of a glowing box." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-recommend-id="image://9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist stands in front of a glowing box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Materials, <em>Ender Magnolia</em>’s primary currency, will let you buy items at the Craftery, which is accessible fairly early in your adventure. A tooltip will eventually let you know that you can break boxes around the map to earn additional Materials, but by the time it gives you this information, you may have already passed up a handful of them. </p><p>So, hey, I just figured I’d let you know to <strong>keep an eye out for boxes with a glow around them</strong> because I’m a nice guy who wants you to be able to afford to buy the first Magic Vial from the Craftery, which will net you an extra Relic slot. You’re welcome. No, really, don’t sweat it.</p><h2 id="h27299"><a id="yolvan"></a>Put Yolvan to good use</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>During the game’s opening hour or so, you’ll fight Yolvan and earn him as a Homunculi that you can equip. Since he fires projectiles, <strong>assign Yolvan to your shoulder button attack slot so that you can hold his attack down</strong> while you use melee attacks, too. This can massively improve the speed at which you deplete the Break Gauge of basic enemies, allowing you to pummel them into submission.</p><p>When the Craftery begins selling Mixed Parts (pretty early on), make sure to buy some and use them to <strong>purchase Yolvan’s Eviscerate ability</strong> to make him even more of a force to be reckoned with. Holding down the button for this ability will unleash a tornado attack that stuns several enemies at once while dishing out surprisingly good damage in the process. Since it can hit multiple enemies at once, it’s a pretty great upgrade over his basic attack in most scenarios.</p><h2 id="h27300"><a id="muninn"></a>Always keep Muninn out</h2><figure id="" data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll get Muninn when exploring the Magicite Mine. This Homunculi can be equipped and summoned to accompany you passively. Unlike most Homunculi, this means you don’t have to press any buttons to make Muninn attack. Instead, it will fly around behind you and occasionally auto-attack foes.</p><p>While this Homunculi doesn’t deal significant damage, it does help to chip away at the Break Gauge of your enemies without you having to micromanage any cooldowns or remember to press any buttons. </p><p>And, of course, if you’d like Muninn to bug off, just hit the assigned button again to send it packing. But, like, why would you not want the help? Are you too good for a friendly owl pal? Don’t be like that.</p><h2 id="h27301"><a id="helix"></a>Don’t miss the Helix Crystal Relic</h2><figure id="" data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll start the game with only a handful of replenishable healing wards, so a bit of passive healing sure would be nice, right? Luckily, you can grab the Helix Crystal early in the game, which will heal you for 3% of your total health every time you defeat an enemy. It may not sound like much, but there are a lot of enemies that are fairly easy to defeat along your path, so it certainly adds up. </p><p>When you’re ready to get it, play until you get the Lower Stratum Key a few hours in, then fast-travel back to the Abandoned Attuner Tent. Head left from the Abandoned Attuner Tent, and open the door to access the Magicite Mine. Inside, head down the slope and all the way to the left until you encounter a rather large foe. Defeat him and grab the Helix Crystal.</p><h2 id="h27302"><a id="difficulty"></a>Lower the difficulty if you’re struggling to git gud</h2><figure id="" data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Ender Magnolia</em> is designed to challenge you, it’s perfectly fine if you decide you’d like to reduce the degree to which it does so. Luckily, <strong>you can adjust the difficulty when resting at a Respite</strong>. You can opt to select from multiple presets, or you can manually adjust various aspects of enemy difficulty, such as health, attack frequency, and more. Do what feels right to you. I’m not here to judge.</p><hr><p><em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When was the last time you dove into Diablo Immortal? Following its bout of controversy upon release, namely, the egregious monetization practices that saw many spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on gems and power-ups for their miniature characters on-screen, I dropped the game. However, Blizzard has continuously updated and improved the experience since its launch. They recently dropped a few new updates, addressing player feedback. Here are the Diablo Immortal patch notes for the past week!</p>



<h2 id="h-january-bug-fixes-for-diablo-immortal">January Bug Fixes for Diablo Immortal</h2>



<p>The past few weeks have brought about a handful of bug fixes for Diablo Immortal that vastly improve the game through performance and gameplay tweaks. While they appear minor on the surface, these updates do make a difference!</p>



<h3 id="h-january-21"><strong>January 21</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would become immobile after entering a Wild Brawl match.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-january-14"><strong>January 14</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed minor visual issues in Westmarch.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed performance issues that caused crashes.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>UI</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where several bundles wouldn’t appear in the Shop.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players couldn’t interact with the Familiar Expeditions menu.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-diablo-immortal-worth-playing-now">Is Diablo Immortal Worth Playing Now?</h2>



<p>If you tried to play Diablo Immortal previously, specifically a year or so ago, then you’re probably a little jaded on the mobile ARPG. But if you’ve yet to try it, now’s an excellent time. At the end of last year, specifically in December, Blizzard pumped out a few updates that genuinely improved the game. There’s word the studio intends to reduce the overall cost of gems, too. That’s a huge boon to current and returning players.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a powerful computer or gaming console for Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2, then Diablo Immortal will suffice for the time being.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite class in Diablo Immortal? Let us know in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a> to discuss the ARPG!</p>



<hr>



<p>If you do play Diablo IV, don’t forget to jump into the new season—Season of Witchcraft. You’ll find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-7-start-date-and-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start date and time here</a>!</p>

		<p>We love a good MOBA here at TSA Towers. Heck, we probably like the odd bad one too. One of the latest and greatest entries in the mega-popular genre is SMITE 2, the sequel to Titan Forge Games breakout hit. While it’s currently rumbling through an open beta launch, the team are adding new content virtually daily, getting it ready for its full launch, with the latest addition being a returning new god in the form of Cabrakan, and the Wandering Market, a bazaar where players can spend their hard-earned – or potentially hard-bought – Coins on new skins for their favourite characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="SMITE 2 Free-to-Play Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTbb9B3UinQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Everything was announced at this past weekend’s SMITE 2 Founders Series event in Las Vegas. The Wandering Market will provide a rotating store for all players to access for free, with additional cosmetic items available via the paid, Premium Collection.</p>
<p>Players will be able to earn Coins to spend in the Wandering Market by completing quests and gaining XP each day. All those lovely Coins will be spendable across the various different collections released in the Wandering Market, so players will be able to save them up for future storefronts/sales as they play, and spend them whenever the mood takes them.</p>
<p>In turn, they shadow-dropped player-favourite Cabrakan into the sequel, delighting many long-term fans. Cabrakan, the destroyer of mountains, represents the Mayan Pantheon of Gods and uses earthquakes to disrupt and crowd control the opposition. We can’t wait to go hands on with him now he’s arrived.</p>

<p>While all this lovely information dropped, they also played a spot of competitive SMITE 2, with the first Founders Series Champions being crowned in Las Vegas when ‘Team Name but with 5 Ms’ beat Team Risk 3-2 in the finals, with BennyQ being crowned MVP. </p>

Having been bested by Sonic and friends twice in the previous films, the Egghead was going to have pivoted to talking to his adoring fans and promoting energy drinks that were probably not good for you.</p><p>There are two scenes that would have had Eggman interrupting the plot to stream to his followers. They contain some funny gags, such as Agent Stone enthusiastically spamming heart emojis on his boss’ stream because <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189">he’s clearly in love with him</a></span>, but still, it’s easy to see why these scenes were cut. In the context of the already busy movie, they likely would have just interrupted the flow and momentum of the action, and frankly, there’s already plenty of Carrey’s antics to go around (maybe too much). But seeing them now does contextualize one line that still made it into the final movie during Carrey’s final monologue.</p><p>At the end of the film, Eggman sacrifices himself to save Earth as he helps Shadow move the self-destructing Eclipse Cannon out of the planet’s orbit. But before he does, the doctor streams a goodbye message to Agent Stone after carelessly tossing him aside earlier in the movie. When he does so, he opens the stream with “This is Dr. Ivo Robotnik dedicating my final live stream to one very special henchman: Agent Stone.”</p><p>The use of the word “final” implies that there were others which, in the finished film, seems a little odd because we hadn’t seen Eggman streaming prior to this moment. While it makes sense that these scenes were deleted, the real shame is that we didn’t get to see Agent Stone yearning and nursing Eggman back to health after the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>. Stobotnik shippers are not taking it well, but at least we’re seeing it now thanks to the digital release.</p><p>These scenes are fun to see, but the most interesting behind-the-scenes content coming out of Paramount right now are the new pieces of concept art which may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775">answered some of the lingering questions from <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The standard version of both modes sees players compete in 3v3 soccer matches with a few unique twists that capitalize on their heroes’ abilities. Both obviously rip elements from Psyonix’s massively popular Rocket League, though, and it looks like the Marvel take on the blown-up soccer experience comes with a few differences, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, the limited-time mode seems to focus on at least three characters – Star-Lord, Iron Fist, and Black Widow – instead of just one hero. The soccer ball also seems to be the size of your average, real-life ball, too, as players can be seen carrying it around the competition and to the goal. Marvel Rivals and Overwatch already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-doesnt-stray-far-from-overwatch-but-its-super-fun-regardless">share more than a few things in common</a>, but it will be hard to say just how similar Clash of Dancing Lions and Lúcioball are until the Marvel event drops in a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marvel Rivals Spring Festival event allows players to complete tasks for rewards, including the Star-Lord Lion’s Mane costume seen in the trailer. Additional details remain under wraps, but NetEase tells players that they’ll be able to earn other goodies, such as a nameplate, spray, and more, as part of the event. While the Iron Fist Lion’s Gaze and Black Widow Lion’s Heartbeat outfits were also shown off in the new video, the developers only tell fans to expect to see the three skins arrive in-game “in the coming weeks.”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Marvel Rivals news, players are still looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gets-suit-from-playstations-spider-man-2-later-this-month">Marvel’s Spider-Man tie-in skin</a> set to arrive later this month.

This new set takes Wizards of the Coast's legendary card game into uncharted territory—the world of professional racing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any new Magic set, players will have new tools and mechanics to explore and build decks around. In <em>Aetherdrift</em>, these come in the form of “Speed” and “Exhaust.” First to the starting line is “Speed,” a new resource that players can accumulate when they play a card with “Start your engines!” which sets your speed value at 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can then increase their speed value once on their turn when they deal damage (combat or non-combat) to an opponent up to a maximum speed of 4. By reaching max speed, these cards will gain additional effects, but perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Speed is that, according to Wizards, once you gain it, it won’t decrease and you can’t lose it. While it takes at least three turns to reach max speed, getting a card with “Start your engines!” onto the battlefield as early as possible will be crucial. Additionally, while no specific cards were revealed, Wizards mentioned that some cards gain effects at different speed levels, not just max speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A good example is the new card <em>Far Fortune, End Boss</em>, which deals one damage to each opponent whenever you attack. However, if you are at max speed, it gains an additional ability: “If a source you control would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, it deals that much damage plus 1 instead.” Since <em>Aetherdrift</em> features many artifact vehicles, <em>Mendicant Core, Guidelight</em> might inspire some deck ideas. Its max speed ability reads: “Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may pay {1} (colorless). If you do, copy it (the copy becomes a token).” I can already think of a few artifact decks that could benefit from a card like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Preview - Key Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is “Exhaust,” which is more straightforward but arguably more powerful. These one-time-use mana abilities compensate for their limited use with incredible versatility and game-changing effects. One of the previewed cards, <em>Redshift, Rocketeer Chief</em>, has the Exhaust ability: “{R}{G} and {10}: Put any number of permanent cards from your hand onto the battlefield.” Its default ability allows you to tap it to add X mana of any single color, where X is equal to its power. Considering that green is known for boosting creature power, you could easily empty your hand onto the battlefield with little trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real trick to maximizing the Exhaust mechanic will be in blink- or copy-heavy decks, allowing players to reuse these phenomenal abilities more than once. For example, recasting your commander with Exhaust or bouncing a card back to your hand will let you activate the ability again. Equipping an Exhaust creature with <em>Helm of the Host</em>, which creates copies with fresh uses of their abilities, could also lead to some truly devastating plays. However you approach it, I foresee plenty of headaches dealing with Exhaust in competitive games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Aetherdrift</em> sets itself apart from other original Magic sets with its unique art style and theme. Love it or hate it, the team has done a commendable job of making the set—and its mechanics—feel cohesive. I’m eagerly anticipating the full list of spoilers so we can get a better idea of just how versatile and widespread the new Speed and Exhaust mechanics will be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many decks will benefit from these abilities, but as with any new mechanic, it remains to be seen how much they will be incorporated into future releases. Sets like <em>Bloomburrow</em>, <em>Duskmorne</em>, and now <em>Aetherdrift</em> have redefined what an “original Magic plane” can be. While the racing aesthetic may seem odd or out of place to some players, for others, the bombastic visuals and vehicle-heavy theme might be exactly what draws them in. <em>Aetherdrift</em> releases on February 14—because nothing says romance like a new MTG set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online in the US after being caught up in the TikTok ban that came into effect for a day at the end of the Biden administration, and developer Second Dinner has now said that they are looking for a new partner and publisher to ensure that the game is unaffected by any future trade wars and legislation.</p>
<p>Chief Development Officer and Second Dinner Co-Founder Ben Brode said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3lg7txo2bcc2j">BlueSky</a>:</p>


<p>WHEW. MARVEL SNAP is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we’re working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>We know this probably leaves you with even more questions than answers. We appreciate your patience, but in the meantime enjoy playing MARVEL SNAP.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to update with more information as soon as possible!</p>

<p>The TikTok ban, a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.R._7521"><span>Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a>, wasn’t just about banning TikTok, but any app created, owned, published or controlled by Chinese tech company ByteDance, or other companies branded as foreign adversary controlled. While Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner is an independent studio based in California, the game is published by ByteDance subsidiary Nuverse.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/20/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/">takedown of Marvel Snap</a> came as a complete surprise to pretty much everyone – the developers included – and has seen the game removed from digital storefronts looking to comply with the law. Within hours, it became clear that service would be restored, off the back of comments from incoming President Trump saying that he would grant the companies a 90 day reprieve to sell TikTok or find some other workaround – he’d actually said this prior to the service being cut and the ban coming into effect, mind you.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2%E2%80%99s-roadmap-includes-updates-and-future-expansions.1088001/</guid>

		<p>Just as we’re winding down in the UK a flurry of news drops through the virtual letterbox to keep us on our toes, and the first of these is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II’s roadmap. Developer Warhorse and publisher PLAION are obviously keen to let gamers know just what they can expect in the months following the game’s release on the 4th of February, when it arrives for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Roadmap Trailer (PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DC7NdeLnMjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first, and perhaps most crucial thing, is that a batch of this content will come via free updates, meaning they’re not nickel and diming you for every little addition – a welcome relief in the current gaming sphere.</p>
<p>Seasonal highlights will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring: Enjoy a selection of updates, free for everyone, introducing a Barbers feature to customise your look, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a greater challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</li>
<li>Summer: Brushes with Death – Embark on a thrilling quest as Henry aids an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. Journey across the lands of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, facing perilous encounters and unravelling a web of dangerous schemes.</li>
<li>Autumn: Legacy of the Forge – Dive into Henry’s roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Work to restore a once-renowned forge and prove your skills in the art of blacksmithing as you uncover forgotten tales of the past.</li>
<li>Winter: Mysteria Ecclesia – Enter the Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue runs deep. Tasked with a covert mission, Henry must navigate the complex dynamics of the region, discovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside these expansions will be a number of free quality-of-life updates to ensure that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reaches its full potential.</p>


<p>We’ve been lucky enough to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">make a start with the game</a>, and Gamoc is already deeply impressed with it, though it’s definitely not been an easy start for him. He says, “Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 seems like an uncompromising marvel. It’s slavishly devoted to realism and accuracy in a way that likely makes it a very niche game, as working out how to do things can be difficult and requires real attention and care. Then again, that was exactly what drew millions to the first game, and as those fans will attest, it’s also incredibly rewarding.” He continues, “The first time I finished a quest that involved combat without it feeling like too much trouble I physically punched the air in celebration, and when I finally reached the blacksmith, got a job, and forged myself a new sword I was grinning from ear to ear. This is a unique game that turns being a peasant in medieval times into an enjoyable experience. Ironically, perhaps.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies.1087998/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Torn Banner Studios is starting 2025 with a bang, as the first free update of 2025 has been released, taking No More Room in Hell 2 to new, frightening heights. The co-op horror shooter game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-gets-first-early-access-update-adds-new-ending-weapons/">released last year</a> in late October in Early Access and is now getting its first free update that will be adding new gameplay features, enhancements, reworks, and bug fixes to make sure that the audience is well taken care of. Below is a montage of the latest update so you can get a glimpse into some of the gory action that you can expect from the 0.2.4 update for No More Room in Hell 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Montage - 0.2.4 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWdOg_Q5lYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the main features of this update is the introduction of a new type of zombie, called the Firefighter Zombie. They are recognizable thanks to their firefighter uniform and their oxygen tanks, which can explode if damaged. While the explosion won't damage players, it can be used to the player's advantage to knock down other nearby zombies.</p>
<p>In addition, caliber ammunition has returned to the game, after many fans have asked for it to be revived for No More Room in Hell 2. This includes a variety of ammunition types, meaning that players will have to consider what ammo they want to carry as there is limited space. This makes gameplay more technical, as players will have to make strategic decisions to be able to fight for their survival.</p>
<p>While some new features have been added to make the game more challenging and technical, the developers have reworked the Runner zombies to make them more unpredictable when attacking the player. However, they now spawn less, as the community had asked for in their feedback. This means that their attacks and movement prove to be more of a threat, but they are less likely to appear in your session so you have ample time to deal with them amidst the ongoing chaos.</p>
<p>In addition to caliber ammunition and new zombie types being added to the game, new Responder skills have been introduced in this update. This includes "Immunity," which reduces the chance of infection by half; "Outdoor CHampion," which mitigates damage from fire, gas, water, and electricity by 30%; and "Builder," which increases stack sizes for barricade boards batteries.</p>
<p>The developers have made sure to add a ton of new content in this update, but they have also been focused on making sure to fix any bugs in the game to improve the overall stability of the game. This includes changes like accurate climbing skills, visual appearance of zombies, and infinite ammo exploits.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this update in <a href="https://www.nmrih2.com/2025/01/21/update-0-2-4-our-first-update-for-the-year-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their blog post</a>, which details all of the changes made in this new update for No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is just weeks away now and, in the run up to its release, developer Warhorse Studios has detailed some of its post-launch update plans for the medieval action-RPG, starting with a handful of free new features this "spring".
</p>
<p>
This initial update promises the introduction of horse racing - in which players can "hone [their] mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises - alongside barbers, providing a way for aesthetically inclined adventurers to customise their looks. Then finally, spring's triumvirate of features concludes with a new Hardcore Mode, promising a "greater challenge".
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, Warhorse has confirmed it's working on three additional post-launch updates: Brushes with Death arrives this "summer", Legacy of the Forge launches this "autumn", and Mysteria Ecclesia is currently scheduled for a "winter" release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/report-ncsofts-horizon-mmo-has-been-cancelled-before-it-was-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It looks like the latest casualty from Sony’s ill-fated live service push is NCSoft’s MMO based of Horizon Zero Dawn, as reported by Korean news outlet <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/">ResetEra</a>). The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/16/a-horizon-forbidden-west-multiplayer-game-has-been-confirmed-by-guerrilla/">live service Horizon game in development at Guerrilla Games</a> themselves, however, is currently unaffected.</p>
<p>Multiple projects at Korean developer NCSoft have been cancelled as part of feasibility reviews, including Project H, Project J and Project Pantera. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/09/a-horizon-mmorpg-is-reportedly-in-development-by-ncsoft/">Leaked back in 2022</a>, Project H had been connected to another codename, Project Skyline, and also back to a partnership between Sony and NCSoft that was then confirmed in 2023.</p>


<p>Horizon was not named in this announcement, but was widely reported to be a spin-off to Guerrilla Games’ hit, looking to expand the franchise beyond core gaming audience and to a more casual mobile and PC one.</p>
<p>It’s not clear who exactly pulled the plug on the project, though you’d have to guess that, given that NCSoft has cancelled multiple projects, it is on their shoulders. The company’s Co-CEO even said, “NC needs to re-arm itself with the venture spirit it first started with. Let’s make 2025 a year of bone-crushing efforts with the mindset that if we don’t turn around by 2025, NC will never have a future.”</p>

<p>This is still also a dent to Sony’s ambitions within live service spheres, off the back of more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">cancellations of games in development at Bend Studios and Bluepoint Games last week</a>. Additionally, this could be seen as a ding to the Horizon franchise at large.</p>
<p>Having retired from PlayStation late last year, former SIE Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida has been doing the rounds, and commented on Horizon when speaking to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?si=xUPTxh0yNrDwTwEo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?si=xUPTxh0yNrDwTwEo" data-hl-processed="none" data-custom-tracking-id="1396370944115762967" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-label="Kinda Funny Games"><u>Kinda Funny Games</u></a>, saying that “The one I was a bit surprised [about] in terms of the number of units [sold] was the second Horizon game.”</p>
<p>He continued “Oftentimes, the second game does better because there are already millions of fans. […] I love Horizon and the game did well, and I was hoping that the sequel would do even better in terms of sales. The game was bigger and great, but I don’t think the second one did as many units as the first one.”</p>
<p>By all counts, Horizon Forbidden West sold well, it just maybe didn’t meaningfully outpace the original. Having launched in February 2022, Horizon Forbidden West had sold over 8.4 million units by April 2023 (13-14 months after launch), not too far removed from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-sells-7-6-million-copies-to-be-sonys-biggest-new-franchise/">7.6 million that Horizon Zero Dawn sold by its first anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The series has seen plenty of activity since then with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-review/">Burning Shores</a> story expansion later in 2023, the PC port launching in 2024, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn remaster</a> late last year as well. In an unexpected move, Sony also produced a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures spin-off</a> that launched across PS5, PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sony also announced a partnership to bring the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">Horizon franchise to the big screen</a> with Colombia Pictures – a division of Sony Pictures.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-counter-strike-2-crosshairs.1087965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-2-crosshairs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Amongst all the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous settings you can tinker with in Counter-Strike 2</a>, there’s arguably none more important than your crosshair. Crosshairs in CS2 can take on different forms, shapes, or sizes, and finding the right one for you is of the utmost importance.</p>



<p>Of course, what can be considered the “best” CS2 crosshair may not be the best for you, as it comes down to personal preference. But if you look at some of the most popular crosshairs in CS2, amongst long-time competitive players and pros, you’ll see some similar traits.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-cs2-crosshair">What is The Best CS2 Crosshair?</h2>



<p><strong>A small, static, compact crosshair that’s green and/or blue in color</strong> is very popular amongst pro players. Some pros use subtle variations like a yellow or white color, a center dot, or a larger gap between the lines. Very few players use a dynamic crosshair that shows movement and firing accuracy, but that accuracy indicator could be good for newer players.</p>



<p>This kind of crosshair is popular because the green/blue color often doesn’t blend in with any background you come across. The smaller, more compact design makes it so it doesn’t block your view, and makes it easier to hit headshot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The best place to look and tryout different crosshairs a Steam Workshop mod called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070193546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crashz’ Crosshair Generator</a>. This mod features a full wall of 80 crosshairs from pro players from the best teams in the world, plus some used by popular content creators. Additionally, there’s a crosshair editor tool that lets you tweak crosshair length, thickness, spacing, color, and opacity until you get it just right.</p>



<p>To try out a crosshair in crashz’ Crosshair Generator, just shoot it on the wall. If you don’t like it, you can shoot the Restore Crosshair button the manager window next to it. You can also exit the room to practice against bots or watermelons. Once you’ve settled on a crosshair.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-crosshair-codes">Best CS2 Crosshair Codes</h2>



<p>If you’d rather just borrow a crosshair directly from one of the best CS2 players in the world, you can do that too. CS2 lets you paste a code that transfers a complete crosshair into your game. To upload a crosshair code in CS2, go to Settings, then to Game, and then Crosshair. Click Share or Import on the crosshair display banner, then copy the code in and click Import.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Please note that some pro players change or alter their crosshairs regularly, so these may not be completely current:</p>



<h3 id="h-donk-s-crosshair-code">Donk’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-KTaY3-rXci2-9DTXB-aPuKV-MDr7C</li>



<li>Small, compact, and perfect for headshots. Used by the consensus best CS2 player of 2024 and reigning Major winner</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-zywoo-s-crosshair-code">ZywOo’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-t3F8R-3M9vV-qVikH-JF3PV-9mUCP</li>



<li>Slightly longer and thinner crosshair lines</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-m0nesy-s-crosshair-code">m0NESY’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-8nb3d-Et6WE-QsF6B-V3E7j-WphrM</li>



<li>Similar to donk’s </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-s1mple-s-crosshair-code">s1mple’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-eoS6N-bA6zC-xUAQn-s3RfJ-zPFuA</li>



<li>Also small and compact, but uses yellow color</li>
</ul>



<p>As a reminder, just because some of the best players in the world use a CS2 crosshair, it doesn’t mean it’s the best for you. It will take some getting used to any crosshair before you finally settle on one, and even then you should be open to tweaking it over time.</p>



<p>Which pro crosshair would you use? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II developer/publisher combo Warhorse Studios and PLAION have unveiled the post-launch roadmap for the upcoming first-person roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-release-date-bumped-forward-by-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for February 4</a>, is just the beginning of the players' new journey with Henry of Skalitz. Throughout 2025, the developers plan to constantly release updates that include various improvements and additions.</p>
<p>The roadmap kicks off this Spring with the introduction of several free enhancements, such as a Barbers feature to customize your looks, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a harsher challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</p>
<p>In the Summer, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will receive its first premium DLC, called Brushes with Death. In this new quest, Henry must aid an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. He'll have to face perilous encounters to unravel a web of dangerous plots.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/KCD2-Roadmap-Image-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In the Fall season, the Legacy of the Forge DLC will dig into Henry's roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Henry will work to restore a once-famous forge and test his blacksmithing skills while uncovering forgotten stories from the past.</p>
<p>In the Winter season, the third and final premium DLC, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released. Players must enter Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue is said to run deep. Henry is tasked with a secret mission and must navigate the complex dynamics of the area, uncovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</p>

<p>The three premium DLCs are included for those who purchase the more expensive versions of the game: either Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition (which is priced $20 higher than the Standard Edition and comes with the Season Pass, the Shields of Seasons Passing that lets players customize their shields with one of four unique designs, and the full costume Gallant Huntsman’s Kit), or the Collector's Edition that adds the following physical goods for a price of $199:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statue of Henry and his trusty steed, Pebbles</li>
<li>the exclusive cloth map Alleys of Kuttenberg</li>
<li>the enamel pin set Coats of Valor</li>
<li>the iconic Letter of Hope - which Sir Hans Capon was entrusted with</li>
<li>and the King’s Rebels collectible cards set</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous article</a>.</p>
