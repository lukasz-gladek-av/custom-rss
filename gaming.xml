Look, here's the thing. I'm no narc, but when it comes to online games, you probably shouldn't cheat. Do what you want in single-player games! But in the multiplayer space you're there to have a nice time with everybody, you know? And as it turns out in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, things can end pretty badly for you (I promise this isn't a Mafia-style threat). The official Monster Hunter Twitter account shared a post yesterday announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> have "confirmed the unauthorized modification of game data in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The post comes with a pretty scary sounding warning too: "Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game unplayable. If you suspect a quest has been modified, please do not play it, or stop playing it immediately." Capcom even provided a handy chart of different criteria, like target monsters, which you'll only ever find one to two of in a quest, and the modified version, which can have three or more. As Capcom warns, if you see something like that, avoid starting the quest.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>üîçExpanded Countermeasures Against Unauthorized Data Modificationüîç</p><p>We plan to implement additional countermeasures in future updates to detect users who have engaged in unauthorized modification of game data to prevent other players from being implicated in such actions.</p><p>We‚Ä¶</p></div>‚Äî Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1913217339102835099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
In a follow-up post, the developer noted it plans to add "additional countermeasures" to find people that are modifying quests like these, which will come in future updates. What these countermeasures are, we'll have to wait and see, but right now Capcom are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534347841813873218?l=english">examining the final ranking results</a> for the recent Doshaguma of the Hollow challenge quest for the next one to two weeks to root out cheaters. If that includes you, you'll likely see your account receive some restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I don't really understand why you'd bother cheating in a game like Monster Hunter where the challenge is the point. Your ranking is meaningless if you didn't achieve it yourself, buddy! Maybe go play a PS2 game and put on big-head mode or something if you've got the need to cheat.

It's Star Wars Celebration right now, which as I gather is about celebrating giant balls of gas fighting one another. Sorry, I'm being told that it's actually about some multimedia franchise that has so much going on it's impossible to keep track of? Doesn't sound right to me, but I'll have to trust it. Arguably the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-star-wars-games-on-pc">Star Warsy game</a> announcement of the weekend is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-zero-company-looks-like-xcom-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-in-its-first-trailer">first trailer for the Star Wars meets XCOM game Star Wars Zero Company</a>, but it wasn't the only one. Turns out last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' second story pack got a reveal too, and a release date to boot.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This one's pirate themed, as evidenced by the DLC's name, A Pirate's Fortune, once again following Kay and Nix on a new adventure in the Khepi system. As is often the case with Star Wars media that isn't the movies, A Pirate's Fortune features one of those Glup Shitto type characters, Hondo Ohnaka, who you'll be joining forces with for this particular escapade. He originally appeared in the animated Clone Wars series, first season even, so even if I jest a touch, he really has been around for a while now.

<p>
You'll also be facing off against a new character called Stinger Tash, both of you looking to enter some place called the Khepi Tomb to "uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds." The DLC also adds in the Miyuki Trade League which can net you goodies for your ship, the Trailblazer, and even if you aren't getting A Pirate's Fortune, everyone will also receive some cosmetics inspired by Star Wars: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeleton-crew">Skeleton Crew</a>.
</p>
<p>
The DLC's out quite soon too, currently due to arrive May 15, less than a month away. I wouldn't bet on any more story stuff after this though, so savour it while you can.

<p>Could it be a mistake? Possibly. Either way, we've reached out to Ubisoft and will update just as soon as we know more.</p>
<p>Relatedly, while we already knew that Ubisoft was also bringing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> to Nintendo Switch 2, this weekend's Star Wars Celebration in Japan - which revealed earlier today that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-next-story-update-is-a-pirates-fortune-and-its-coming-next-month">its next story-based DLC is coming on 15th May</a> - revealed the Star Wars adventure will <em>not</em> be a launch title, instead releasing on 4th September, 2025.</p>
<p>We awarded Assassin's Creed Shadows four out of five stars, with our resident Creed expert Tom writing in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>: "Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of Switch 2</a>, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories "due to changes in market conditions".</p>
<p>A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively. But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, will not increase in price for now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We've all known it's coming for a long while now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-are-making-three-new-star-wars-games-including-a-new-strategy-game-with-former-xcom-devs">three years in fact</a>, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> got a proper reveal today. In case you aren't sure which one this was meant to be, it's the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> one from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bit-reactor">Bit Reactor</a>, led by former XCOM devs. For the most part the announcement trailer is just a CGI cutscene, you've been round this rodeo before, you know how these things go. Though, it does end with a smidge of gameplay and yeah, it really does just look like Star Wars by way of XCOM, which is likely to be an instant winner.
</p>

<p>
I'm not exactly sure if "gritty" and "authentic" are words that'd normally apply to any Star Wars media - let's not forget Yoda was literally performed and played by The Muppets' own Fozzie Bear - but that's how Star Wars Zero Command has been described, at the very least. The single-player game is set "during the twilight of the Clone Wars" where you'll play as Hawks, a "former Republic officer" who leads the titular Zero Company.

<p>
They're a band of misfits, by the sounds of things, and they've been recruited by Hawks that sees them facing off against some vague threat that could consume the galaxy, or whatever. This is Star Wars, there's always galaxy threatening stuff going on, and this is a prequel so we can only assume things will generally end well - though, in a press release CEO and creative director of Bit Reactor Greg Foertsch did say in a statement that they're aiming to provide "meaningful outcomes" based on the choices you make.
</p>
<p>
The core gameplay looks mighty similar to XCOM, and apparently between missions you'll be able to build up your own base and do spy things like gathering intelligence. On top of that you'll be able to make and customise your own squad of "authored Star Wars characters", so it sounds like you shouldn't expect Jar Jar Binks to show up.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps predictably, an exact release date hasn't been confirmed just yet, but it is supposedly releasing sometime in 2026, and it'll be available on PC via Steam.

<p>Techland also <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/update-122-spring-update">revealed</a> there's now "enhanced co-op gameplay with fixed enemy behaviour synchronisation issues" which reduces teleporting and lag, and whilst console players have to wait a little bit longer, PC players can now customise textures for Villedor thanks to new mod tools.</p>
<p>"In the Spring Update, you'll experience a slew of enhancements designed to elevate your co-op experience," the team explained. "We have addressed and resolved various enemy behaviour issues affected by synchronisation between players. This intends to ensure smoother gameplay and reduced discrepancies, including the amount of enemies teleporting and lagging.</p>
<p>"The HUD has also received substantial improvements, providing clearer visual cues and streamlined access to vital information, ultimately enhancing situational awareness with multiple players on screen."</p>
<p>For the full list of fixes, head on over to the <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/update-122-spring-update">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Dying Light 1 released on 26th January, 2015, and proved to be a massive hit for Techland, selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">over 20m copies as of 2022</a>. A sequel followed in 2022, and an 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">set to arrive this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Techland teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">plans for "multiple unannounced projects" set in the Dying Light universe</a> - including new video games, board games, and a webcomic - as the zombie series celebrates its tenth birthday.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Embark on a mysterious adventure with Kay and Nix to explore the Khepi system and learn what it takes to be a true leader," teases the blurb. "Team up with legendary pirate Hondo Ohnaka and face off against Stinger Tash and her Rokana Raiders as you infiltrate the Khepi Tomb to uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds.</p>
<p>"Along the way, you‚Äôll discover the Miyuki Trade League, who offer new rewards for the Trailblazer in exchange for smuggling dangerous goods across the galaxy."</p>
<p>As part of the update, all players will be gifted cosmetic items inspired by Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a Trophy for the speeder, and a Trinket for both the speeder and the Trailblazer. They'll pop up in your delivery crate on the Trailblazer after downloading and installing the update.</p>
<p>We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release last August.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of Uncharted. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647481/haste-broken-worlds-game-review-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> takes the relaxing loop of sliding down and leaping off hills from iOS classic <em>Tiny Wings</em> and turns it into a thrilling, high-speed, and 3D roguelike.</p><p>In <em>Haste</em>, you play as Zoe, a girl who typically delivers letters but has found herself mysteriously transported to the new worlds you run through. When I say run, I mean it: Zoe <em>cannons</em> through the game.</p><p>Levels are filled with rolling hills, and your goal is to leap off the upslopes and land on the downslopes. The better your landings, the more you‚Äôll increase your speed and build a boost meter that can be used for things like a burst forward or a grappling hook.</p><p>You‚Äôre incentivized to keep your speed up. The faster you complete a level, the higher grade you‚Äôll get; higher grades give you better bonuses of things like ‚Äúsparks,‚Äù which you can use to buy items.</p><p>Throughout the vibrant, procedurally generated levels, you‚Äôll also have to avoid obstacles like rocks, giant <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlacc">Sarlacc-like pits</a>, and machines that shoot lasers and bullets at you. If you crash into an object, you‚Äôll lose health and slow down. If you‚Äôre too slow, a crackling, damaging energy will sneak up behind you. If you run out of health, you‚Äôll lose a life. Lose all your lives, and your run will end. </p><p>There are some familiar roguelike mechanics in <em>Haste</em>, like a currency you can spend between runs to permanently improve things like your health and boost meters. During runs, you‚Äôll also pick each stage on a map. <em>Haste</em> has a great map feature that lets you pick some or all of your route in advance so that you can play a series of levels without interruption. It really helps with the momentum.</p><p>When things are going well, it‚Äôs easy to reach an amazing flow state where you‚Äôre leaping from hills at breakneck speed, timing your landings and boosts, dodging obstacles in your path, and racing to the end of every level as fast as you can.</p><p>But at the end of each zone (technically a ‚Äúshard‚Äù), there‚Äôs a large boss ‚Äî like a giant flying snake ‚Äî and they were often total buzzkills. The boss levels force you to run through more open-ended zones instead of just blasting forward, and the game just isn‚Äôt as fun and feels tougher in the open environments. Thankfully, you can change the game‚Äôs difficulty level.</p><p>The game‚Äôs storytelling messes up the flow, too. You‚Äôll meet a bunch of characters, and while their personalities are fun and their character portraits are illustrated well, they often show up in lengthy, forced conversations between levels. For a game called <em>Haste</em>, there are a lot of long chats!</p><p>Those quibbles only detracted a little from how much I enjoyed <em>Haste</em>. At its best, <em>Haste</em> keeps you on the edge of your seat as you leap up and down from hills and careen through worlds. But when the game changes pace, it can be frustrating. I just want to go fast. </p><p><sub>Haste: Broken Worlds</sub><em><sub> is now available on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/651376/lucas-pope-papers-please-gdc-2025-pioneer-award<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lucas Pope, the solo creator of games like <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>, received the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250219539980/en/2025-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Honors-Iconic-WriterDirector-Sam-Lake-With-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-and-Innovative-Designer-Lucas-Pope-With-Pioneer-Award">Pioneer Award</a> from the annual Game Developers Choice Awards this year. It‚Äôs a major achievement that puts him in a league with industry giants like Gabe Newell, Yu Suzuki, and Roberta Williams.</p><p>‚ÄúNow that I‚Äôm an official pioneer, I have some requests,‚Äù he said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kEXe913VjSs?feature=shared&amp;t=10801">brief acceptance speech</a>. ‚ÄúWorld peace, obviously. But for this crowd, I‚Äôd be happy if you kept making the kinds of unique off-beat, experimental, creative, and especially personal games that I love.‚Äù</p><p>It was similar to something Pope had said to me earlier ‚Äî especially the personal part. I had asked him what advice he might have for developers just starting out. ‚ÄúMake something personal, make it small, release on [Itch.io]. Try to find the people who like the same things you do and then make the things you enjoy.‚Äù</p><div><p>‚ÄúI want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.‚Äù</p></div><p>Games, for him, have always been about ‚Äúmaking something that I want to play,‚Äù Pope said. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329676/papers-please-a-game-about-an-immigration-inspector"><em>Papers, Please</em></a>, where you have to make tough decisions while working as an immigration inspector in a fictional country, ‚Äúit was, ‚ÄòI want this kind of game. I like looking at documents.‚Äô Nobody else really likes that, was my thinking. And then I made it and I found out, actually, lots of people like the same things I do.‚Äù</p><p>That experience gave him the confidence to follow a similar path for his next game. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to try that again. I‚Äôm going to make a game that doesn‚Äôt exist, that I wish I had and that I could play, and I‚Äôll make that. And just based on faith, I‚Äôm going to hope that other people also like it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs something that you‚Äôre passionate about, then make a game about it.‚Äù</p><p>That game turned out to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17993710/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-lucas-pope-pc-mac"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>, where you‚Äôre an insurance inspector investigating deaths and mysteries on the namesake ship. Pope‚Äôs latest title is <a href="https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/"><em>Mars After Midnight</em></a>, a game for the Playdate about screening aliens at a fictional Martian support center.</p><p>It‚Äôs much sillier than <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Obra Dinn</em>; one scenario in <em>Mars</em> asks you to only admit aliens that fart. In <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/mars-after-midnight/devlog/261758/mars-after-midnight">a blog post</a> about the game, Pope described it as ‚Äúsomething my kids might like,‚Äù and he told me that while the kids know about <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Obra Dinn</em>, they‚Äôre too young to play them because they‚Äôre M-rated. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of why I wanted to make <em>Mars</em>. I wanted a game where they could just full-on play it and enjoy it.‚Äù</p><p>Pope said they played <em>Mars</em> ‚Äúdozens of times‚Äù and offered suggestions for some of the sessions in the game. As kids, they don‚Äôt have a lot of preconceived notions, he said, so while some of their ideas might have been ‚Äúa little ridiculous,‚Äù he could see ‚Äúthe core of a really cool thing that I could munge it a little bit and get it in there.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúI think about games a certain way, but the kids have no framing like that. So having kids does help me see how they play games.‚Äù</p><p>As for what Pope wants to explore next? ‚ÄúWhen I could reflect on <em>Obra Dinn</em> and <em>Papers, Please</em>, I kind of realized [that] maybe I should be going back to 2D,‚Äù he said, noting that <em>Mars</em> is ‚Äúmore or less‚Äù a 2D game, too. From a production and creativity standpoint, ‚Äúit‚Äôs nice to work in 2D,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut as far as actual topics and mechanics and things like that, I‚Äôm working on a few things. Nothing that is ready for announcement, unfortunately.‚Äù</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Void Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not is coming to consoles later this year.</p>
<p>Whilst the developer stopped short of confirming a firm release date - "summer" (Q3) is the closest we have right now - it did reveal the shooter would also be coming to Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, too.</p>
<p>To celebrate, here's a brand new cinematic trailer that debuted at the Galaxies Showcase:</p>

<p>Ready or Not sees you visit Los Sue√±os, where a surge of crime across the greater Los Sue√±os metropolitan area has severely depleted resources, threatening to "overwhelm the department's ability to maintain order". In response to the growing threats facing residents, LSPD is mobilising its SWAT teams to respond to high-threat scenarios, including active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and high-risk hostage situations.</p>
<p>Ready or Not features "immersive tactical gameplay, full flexibility of approach, and authentic equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field". You can expect 20 single-player or online co-op missions to play with up to four pals, as well as two new missions as part of the Stories from Los Sue√±os free DLC update.</p>
<p>You'll also get two DLCs that introduce six additional levels, and, in Dark Waters DLC, the UH-60 support helicopter. There are also "dozens of options to customise a player‚Äôs entire SWAT team" including armour, weapons, and apparel.</p>
<p>PC players will have access to the new missions in a free update day-and-date with console launch.</p>
<p>Pre-orderers will also secure the M32A1 grenade launcher, MK-V pistol, 590M shotgun, with players who already have the game on PC also getting the freebies. The game will cost ¬£45 ($50 / ‚Ç¨50) whether you buy the base game or the Day One Edition, which includes the pre-order items. There's also a ¬£60 ($70 / ‚Ç¨70) Deluxe Edition that includes the base game with three DLC packs - Home Invasion, Dark Waters, and an unannounced one - plus the pre-order goodies also bundled in.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after comments suggested it would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>. Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-coming-to-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Star Wars Zero Company</a> which is in development with BitReactor and Respawn on board. The initial reveal just told us that we would get more news this weekend, and that moment has arrived with the game‚Äôs first trailer along with the first details. What it confirms is that Star Wars Zero Company will be a turn based tactics game, looking a bit like XCOM, set during the final stages of The Clone Wars.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story follows Hawks, a former Republic Officer, and his group known as Zero Company. All of the Zero Company members are essentially mercenaries for hire from across the galaxy, with each of them having their own skills. You have a droid that will be to able to hack systems, a Jedi that has Force abilities, a Mandalorian armed with all the gadgets, a Clone Trooper, and what looks like some kind of assassin. They are not the best of friends and will have their own differences to work out between themselves. We get a brief look of gameplay in the reveal trailer and that shows the turn based tactical element of Star Wars Zero Company, from positioning your characters to using their abilities in the most efficient way to take out enemies. When not in a fight, Hawks and Zero Company will set up a base of operations to gather intelligence from across the galaxy using informants who will point them to targets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur vision for Star WarsZero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,‚Äù said Greg Foertsch, CEO and Creative Director at Bit Reactor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our aim to deliver a game with an original&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt Lucasfilm Games, we‚Äôre huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,‚Äù said Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP, Lucasfilm Games. ‚ÄúThe best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we‚Äôre confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to&nbsp;Star Wars.‚Äù</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is set to released in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC. The game is available to wishlist now.</p>

This new tale&nbsp;sees Kay Vess and Nix team up with pirate Hondo Ohnaka (who fans may remember from the <em>Clone Wars</em> animated show) to plunder the riches of the Khepi Tomb.</p>

<p>However, they‚Äôll have to take on Stinger Tash and her Rokana Raiders. Kay also meets the Miyuki Trade League, who tasks Kay with smuggling goods in exchange for new rewards for the <em>Trailblazer</em>. To access the DLC, players will need to have completed the main story campaign. Check out the trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c27kWaF7umo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>A Pirate‚Äôs Bay will be automatically available to Season Pass owners and can be purchased standalone. Ubisoft has not listed the √† la carte price for the DLC, but the previous story expansion, Wild Card, cost $14.99, so we imagine this is similarly priced. Additionally, a title update arriving alongside A Pirate‚Äôs Bay will give all players free cosmetic items inspired by the Disney Plus series <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em>. You can find these items in the delivery crate inside the <em>Trailblazer</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, a free three-hour demo of the game is now available. We also learned that the Switch 2 version of Star Wars Outlaws launches on September 4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/">website</a> confirms the console prices will remain unchanged.

The prices for both the physical and digital versions of Mario Kart World ($79.99) and Donkey Kong Bananza ($69.99) also remain the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Nintendo states Switch 2 accessories will have ‚Äúprice adjustments‚Äù from their previously announced retail prices. Nintendo cites ‚Äúchanges in market conditions‚Äù for the changes, and states that future adjustments to Nintendo products are also possible based on the changing market.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>EA has finally given us our first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company.</p>
<p>The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022. It's described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>You play as Hawks, a customisable former Republic officer, and will command an elite squad of "cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars". As an unconventional outfit of professionals for hire hailing from across the galaxy, Zero Company must set aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that will consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign includes tactical operations and investigations "across the galaxy", whilst between missions, you will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Company‚Äôs adversaries. You'll be able to create and customise your squad of recruited operators while "getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters".</p>
<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," said Greg Foertsch, CEO and creative director at Bit Reactor.</p>
<p>"It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>As yet there's no release date, but EA advises it's shooting for a 2026 release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-veterans-form-new-studio-bit-reactor-to-focus-on-turn-based-strategy">founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/bit-reactors-tactical-star-wars-game-star-wars-zero-company-will-be-revealed-this-saturday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to fans earlier this week, the upcoming turn-based tactics game STAR WARS Zero Company was revealed today during the Star Wars Celebration Japan event.</p>
<p>This is the game that Bit Reactor has been working on alongside Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-2-officially-announced-alongside-two-new-star-wars-projects-from-respawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> alongside Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in early 2022. Bit Reactor was founded by former XCOM veterans led by Greg Foerstch, so it's no surprise that the game follows that design inspiration. Foerstch, CEO and Creative Director of the Maryland-based developer, said in a statement:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Our vision for STAR WARS Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay. It‚Äôs our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.</em></p>
<p>Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP at Lucasfilm Games, added:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>At Lucasfilm Games, we‚Äôre huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time. The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we‚Äôre confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.</em></p>
<p>In this game, players will step into the shoes of Hawks, a former Republic officer who must lead an elite squad of cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars. An unconventional team of hired guns from across the galaxy, the Zero Company must put aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that might consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign of STAR WARS Zero Company will task players with performing tactical operations and investigations across the galaxy. Between missions, they will establish a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of their enemies. Just as you'd expect in an XCOM-like title, there will be the freedom to create and customize your own squad of recruited operatives while meeting a cast of newly created Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>The main character's appearance and combat class can be fully customized, while recruited operatives can be personalized in appearance, load-outs, and abilities from a range of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, Astromechs, and even a Jedi. In the field, the team will form bonds with each other to unlock powerful combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle. The developers promise high-stakes encounters that will require proper strategy to be overcome.</p>

<p>STAR WARS Zero Company is set to launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Wishlisting is already available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075800/STAR_WARS_Zero_Company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-zero-company/" data-ref-id="5000-672878">Star Wars: Zero Company</a> will feature a varied roster of characters as part of the main squad, including a Mandalorian, Jedi Padawan, and an astromech droid--but for the main protagonist of Hawks, players will be free to customize that operative. Speaking to GameSpot, Bit Reactor creative director Greg Foertsch revealed that players will have a selection of options to help fine-tune the look of Hawks, ranging from gender and voice through to their species in the Star Wars galaxy.</p><p>"You can live through that character however you want," Foertsch said. "If you want to change the species, you can. If you want to change their voice, you can."</p><p>The driving theme behind Hawks will be their origin story as a former Republic officer and how they're forced to assemble a motley crew to take on a dangerous adversary while the Clone Wars rage on in the background. While Hawks has been designed to have just enough of a personality for players to imprint themselves on, Zero Company's roster of "authored characters" will all have their own distinct backstories and personalities that players will discover as they progress through the game. One of these allies is Tell, a Jedi Padawan on a quest to finish her fallen master's final mission, and there'll also be some friction between the rest of the crew due to natural rivalries and animosity.</p><p>Interestingly, players will be able to strengthen the bonds between these operatives, resulting in powerful synergy skills that can help turn the tide of battle. "With the authored characters, I think something that the team at Bit Reactor has done a really great job of is sort of weaving in the different perspectives that you would expect them to have on the galaxy and the Clone Wars, with this specific story and this adversary that your company is going up against," LucasFilm Games creative executive Kelsey Sharpe added.</p><p>"It's like a little bit of intrigue--the more you know about Star Wars--but also if you don't know Star Wars, just from watching that trailer you kind of see how they bounce off of each other and you go, 'Oh, this isn't the fun times gang that I thought they were,' right?"</p><p>For more on Star Wars: Zero Company, you can check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-reveal-trailer-teases-stealthy-tactics-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away/1100-6530939/" data-ref-id="1100-6530939">reveal trailer from Star Wars Celebration Japan</a> and read up on how the developers behind it are looking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-will-be-an-approachable-tactics-game-but-hardcore-fans-will-be-catered-to/1100-6530935/" data-ref-id="1100-6530935">create an approachable entry in the tactics genre</a>.</p>
