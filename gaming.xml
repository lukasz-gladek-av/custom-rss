			<p>Epic Games announced the release of Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, following the <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly successful finale of Fortnite Chapter Six: Zero Hour</a>, where 10.5 million players joined the event in the game and over three million were watching through various livestreams.</p>



<p>As fitting for the Golden Coast island, players will 'Storm Surf' their way to it instead of dropping from the Battle Bus as usual. Once there, they'll find a brand new sun-soaked map that can be explored on foot, with vehicles, and even with the new hot air balloons. The developers outlined the following key locations: </p>



<p>● Battlewood Boulevard<br>● Sandy Strip<br>● Wonkeeland<br>● Humble Hills<br>● Bumpy Bay<br>● Classified Canyon</p>



<p>As you can see in the image gallery below, Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break features a fair amount of variety in locales.</p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break introduces a few juicy gameplay additions, such as drivable reboot vans and a self-revive device that can be used when the player is in the DBNO (down but not out) state. DBNO is also further enhanced with the ability to roll and tumble away from enemy fire, a sprinting ability which uses Energy, the ability to use ziplines, ascenders, and even get into cars as a passenger, or crawling or being thrown into the back of the aforementioned reboot van.</p>



<p>Defeating bosses like Human Bill, Hush, or Beach Brutus will let you claim their powers as well as their loot, giving your character full health and shield, a bonus maximum health and shield, infinite energy, and a powerful ability. On the flip side, your position will be visible to nearby opponents at all times.</p>



<p>In Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break, during each phase of the storm, Rift anomalies may summon loot and grant powerful effects to everyone in the match. More anomalies will be added throughout the course of the season.</p>



<p>Furthermore, to ensure fairness at the start of a match, gold bars will no longer carry over from one match to another. As such, players should spend them before the current match ends to reboot their teammates, hire characters, or grab powerful gear from vending machines with a new item stock. Epic is also now letting players drop bars to share resources with teammates.</p>



<p>Additional improvements include redesigned hit markers and improved visibility, ammo status indicators for weapons in the inventory, the ability to aim down sight while jumping, a spectator mode that now automatically tunes into the nearest teammate, and an overhauled emote wheel.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new season adds several new weapons that Epic says are more responsive, offering layered recoil and smoother ADS (aiming down sight) transitions. Reload progress is now saved when your magazine is empty, which is certainly going to be useful. Here's the list of new weapons in Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break:</p>



<p>● Iron Pump Shotgun: A new heavy-hitting Pump Shotgun.<br>● Twin Hammer Shotguns: Dual-wielded Pump Shotguns.<br>● Deadeye Assault Rifle: Scoped, automatic, and built for those who hit headshots at middle-to-long ranges.<br>● Holo Rush SMG: Scoped, fast, and dangerous in tight quarters.<br>● Vengeful Sniper Rifle: Reaps opponents with bolt-action precision.<br>● Arc-Lightning Gun: Zap players, vehicles, and builds with electricity.<br>● Forsaken Vow Blade: Dash in and out faster than with the Kinetic Blade, unleashing a flurry of lightning-fast strikes.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fortnite-chapter-seven-pacific-break-wingsuit.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The wingsuit is a featured item for this season, allowing players to glide through the Golden Coast island. Moreover, the following items are returning from the Vault:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Terrain Kart (alongside the usual sports cars and SUVs)</li>



<li>Enforcer AR, Tactical Pistol and Dual Micro SMG</li>



<li>Shockwave and Clinger grenades</li>



<li>Chug Jugs</li>



<li>Shield Kegs</li>



<li>Med Kits</li>



<li>Bandages</li>



<li>Shield Potions</li>



<li>Mini Shield Potions</li>



<li>Zero Build only: Shield Bubble Jrs and Port-a-Bunkers</li>
</ul>



<p>The Fortnite Chapter Seven: Pacific Break Battle Pass lets you seek revenge as The Bride, represent the future as Marty McFly and unlock Fortnite originals such as Miles Cross and Cat Holloway, plus a new version of Dark Voyager. It also features special styles for three outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). These additional Styles can only be unlocked by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload and Battle Royale, respectively.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quentin Tarantino's The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge</a> will premiere later today at 2 PM Eastern Time.</p>

<figure data-uuid="531917e66ddbe"><a title="Art of Mana" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/531917e66ddbe/art-of-mana.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix, Dark Horse Books</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Dark Horse and Square Enix are celebrating three decades of the Mana series with an English version of <strong>Legend of Mana: The Art of Mana - 30th Anniversary Edition</strong> book.</p>
<p>This is the first time this book has been published in English and will give fans a "deeper look" at the action RPG. Here's some additional PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A full-color art book giving fans a deeper look at the action roleplaying game, <em>Legend of Mana</em>. This will be the first time the book has been published in English and will include art created for the game’s original release in 1999, as well as art crafted exclusively for this book by Yukata koyama, Shinichi Kamoeka, Masaki Takahashi, HACCAN, and Kanta Kamei.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"This 80-page special 30th anniversary edition art book contains <em>Legend of Mana</em>’s vast Lands and Artifacts, character pixel art, Mystic Cards, boss monster illustrations, and more. Fans can take a deeper look into the materials and illustrations created when the original version of the <em>Legend of Mana</em> game was released, including newly drafted selection screen art, character designs, and background art."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, this book includes 80 pages in total. It will be available in hardcover and is scheduled to arrive in bookstores on <strong>28th July 2026</strong> for <strong>$29.99</strong> (or the equivalent). Pre-orders are now available on the Dark Horse website and other sites like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>The Video Game Library (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRnUxHujTyW/">via Instagram</a>) has also cleared up some confusion about the "30th Anniversary" subtitle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The book itself was originally published in 2021 in Japan (30 years after Seiken Densetsu). This is the long-awaited English localization"</p>

<p>Apart from this, some problems with certain other titles have also been identified.

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo recently launched a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">dedicated search page</a>, allowing users to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Pinball machines are an enduring icon of gaming, but their main drawback is that they take up a lot of space.

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 83″ OLED S85F 4K Smart TV (2025) at 42% Off, Time to Throw Out Your 65″ and Upgrade]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-83-oled-s85f-4k-smart-tv-2025-at-42-off-time-to-throw-out-your-65-and-upgrade-2000648809</link>
            <guid>1368379</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>

Engineered for both work and play, the V2 Iskur supports your upper and lower back, features adjustable armrests, and offers thicker padding to keep you comfortable for long stretches. This model also has a wider seat compared to the original iteration, allowing for more even pressure distribution. An integrated lumbar arch support helps you maintain a healthy posture, and the chair offers an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees for a more relaxed position. One thing to note is that the V2 Iskur will require assembly, but it's easy and relatively quick thanks to the included instructions.</p><p><strong>Razer Iskur V2 Gaming Chair Deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Ergonomic-Gaming-Built/dp/B0DP5SY554?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Ergonomic-Gaming-Built/dp/B0DXS1BVCB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light Gray</a> -- $250 (<del>$300</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Amazon also has several other <a href="https://amzn.to/48ex6Ek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer gaming chairs on sale</a> currently.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-buds-3-pro-go-for-new-all-time-low-samsung-wants-to-sell-10x-more-than-airpods-this-cyber-monday-2000648805</link>
            <guid>1368367</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s goal with their AI-powered earbuds was to make them understand how you listen instead of making you change how you listen – and they did this before Apple even announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have similar features. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has adaptive intelligence</strong> that automatically changes based on your surroundings and makes them smarter than anything else you have in your ears right now.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">lowered the price of these silver earbuds from $249 to just $159 for Cyber Monday weekend</a>. This is the lowest price ever for Samsung’s best wireless earbuds. Since Apple’s latest model doesn’t beat these on any important spec, this deal is even better for anyone who wants high-quality sound without the high price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI That Hears What You Say</h2>
<p>Samsung made these earbuds with Galaxy AI technology which does the hard work for you so you don’t have to think about it. The adaptive active noise cancellation <strong>always keeps an eye on your surroundings and changes itself on the fly</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with settings when you go from a quiet office to a busy street. This means that when the earbuds sense that the environment is louder, they automatically turn up the noise cancellation. And when you need to hear conversations or announcements around you, they turn it down.</p>
<p>The adaptive equalizer goes even further by looking at how the buds fit in your ear and changing the sound profile to fit: Everyone’s ears are different, so the same earbuds can sound very different to different people.</p>



<p>The new fit fixes one of the biggest problems people had with older Galaxy Buds models: they were uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Samsung changed the design of these Buds 3 Pro to a canal style and the stems are shaped like blades which helps with <strong>stability and keeps the weight evenly distributed</strong>. When you use the stems, they light up with a soft glow. This looks cool and also makes them easier to find when you put them down in low light.</p>
<p>The Real-Time Interpreter feature turns these earbuds into a t<strong>ravel buddy that helps you talk to people in person</strong> who don’t speak the same language. When you turn on this feature, the person speaking Spanish hears their language through the phone speaker, and you hear the English translation directly in your ears. This makes the conversation flow smoothly without both people having to huddle around a screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>sound quality is good because there are two amplifiers and planar tweeters</strong> that handle high frequencies well and keep distortion low even when the volume is high. The dedicated high and low frequency channels keep bass and treble processing separate. This keeps tracks with a lot of instruments in different frequency ranges from getting muddy. You can hear this separation best in orchestral music or thick electronic music, where cheaper earbuds tend to make everything sound like a wall of sound.</p>
<p>At $159, you’re getting Samsung’s best earbuds for $90 less than their normal price: This puts them in the same price range as mid-range options that don’t have any AI features. The <strong>two-year Amazon-only warranty</strong> gives you twice the coverage you would normally get.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-crash-to-all-time-low-year-round-lighting-cheaper-than-budget-holiday-lights-2000648801</link>
            <guid>1368355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting systems get rid of the yearly hassle of putting up and taking down disposable holiday lights every winter, then storing the tangled strands that always stop working the next year. Govee’s permanent outdoor lights “Pro” stay up all year on your roofline or eaves and you can change the color scheme for holidays, seasons, or everyday accent lighting with just a few taps in an app.</p>
<p>Installation is surprisingly easy because the clips have adhesive backs that attach each light in about eight seconds: This gets rid of the ladder gymnastics and frustration that make hanging lights the most hated chore. Normally, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">200-foot kit with 120 RGBIC LED lights costs $759 but Amazon is currently offering it for just $459, which is the lowest price ever</a>. This deal started on Black Friday and will last through Cyber Monday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Gives You Real Color Flexibility</h2>
<p>The RGBWWIC label means that <strong>each bulb has six separate LED chips: red, green, blue, warm white, cool white</strong>&nbsp;and an integrated circuit control that lets you control each light separately. This wider range of colors goes beyond basic RGB systems that have trouble getting whites right. It gives you bright, saturated colors for parties and holidays, as well as natural warm and cool whites that are good for everyday outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>warm white mode at 2700K makes the room feel cozy</strong>, like old-fashioned Edison bulbs. The <strong>cool white mode at 6500K</strong>, on the other hand, gives off bright light that is great for security or task lighting around doorways and walkways.<strong> Each light can give off up to 50 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is bright enough to light up the outside of your home instead of just adding decorative touches that get lost in street lighting.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design makes the light into a triangular beam pattern that cuts down on harsh glare while still letting people on the street and in nearby homes see it. This optical engineering stops the raw LED bulbs from blinding people when they look directly at them, making the display more pleasant for you and anyone who walks by your house. The<strong> 75 pre-programmed scene modes</strong> have animated effects like color waves, twinkling patterns, and gradient transitions that move across the whole 200-foot run.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app lets you control each LED individually so you can change the colors of different parts of your roofline to make patterns, text, or images on the outside of your home. You could show off the colors of your favorite sports team, write messages for special occasions, or make patterns of the American flag for patriotic holidays without having to buy different light strings.</p>
<p>The <strong>lights and power adapter both have an IP67 waterproof rating</strong>&nbsp;which means that they can be submerged in water up to 1 meter deep without being damaged. This makes them very safe from rain, snow, and sprinkler overspray. The <strong>IP65</strong> control box doesn’t protect as well but it can still handle heavy rain and dust without any problems. <strong>Govee says these lights will last for 50,000 hours</strong> which is more than 5 years of continuous use or decades of normal seasonal use.</p>



<p>To install, use the included VHB (Very High Bond) adhesive and clips to attach the lights 2 to 4 inches away from the wall or soffit. Each clip snaps onto the light housing and sticks to the outside of your house. This keeps the bulb at the right angle and distance for the best light distribution. The system comes in 16.4-foot sections that connect with waterproof joints. This lets you go around corners, over different rooflines, or skip parts where things like chimneys get in the way.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday price of $459 instead of $759 makes permanent outdoor lighting cost less than many homeowners spend on disposable lights over just a few years, while delivering capabilities that temporary strands can’t approach.</p>

            <p>
I understand why walking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sims</a> aren't really a thing any more. Some of the earliest big names like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a>, and arguably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> all came at a time where indie games were growing in popularity, but were still predominantly 2D. Something simple like a walking sim is obviously quite resourceful compared to contemporary AAA games, but now the indie scene has blown up to the point where mechanics-first genres like roguelikes are dominating. Except I like walking sims! So when a game like nophenia, a walking sim where you're a wolfgirl with a flip phone exploring different dream worlds, shows up, I'm going to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
There is a real boldness to nophenia's very simple Steam page. "There is… no game," the about section explains. "You walk around and explore brutalist but also dream-like environments." Aside from that, it explains that there are dedicated "sit" and "howl" buttons because "wolfgirls are super cool" (wolfgirls are super cool), and lists out the controls. Mysterious…
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
Luckily, there's a (very short, I should note) demo to try out. It really is as simple as it describes, you can walk or run around, jump, but primarily you're taking in the sights. And these sights are quite lonely. There's no one else around, apart from in one dream where there is an infinitely passing train. In another dream, umbrellas strewn across a flooded road imply passersby. You let out a howl, only for it to not be reciprocated. All you can do is press forward, more so figuratively, moving from one dream to the next, taking all the time you want in each of them, unable to return to the previous one.
</p>
<p>
I like the flip phone pause menu too. There's a quality of longing in the demo for some kind of quiet, a sense of digital escape. It doesn't feel like an accident that you start in a messy bedroom with a boarded up door, the main source of light coming from a computer, the current source of all evil in this world. There's a photo mode too, and while aesthetically you're not using your flip phone, that's obviously the vibe, with the screenshots it produces outputting at a measly but nostalgic 640x480p.
</p><p>
Everything nophenia has going for it makes a strong argument for the value of walking sims. They're a genre that forces us to take our time, slow down a little, stay with our thoughts, and that seems to come through thematically here as well.
</p>
<p>
What other dreams nophenia might hold, I look forward to seeing whenever it arrives in early 2026. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3979330/nophenia/">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-sold-out-after-black-friday-chaos-amazon-offers-ps5-pro-at-record-low-this-cyber-monday-2000648789</link>

              <p>The PS5 Slim, both the Digital and Standard editions, sold out completely during Black Friday sales. But the good news is that Amazon just cut the price of the PS5 Pro for Cyber Monday weekend and gives shoppers a rare chance to get Sony’s very best console at a record low price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This PlayStation 5 Pro usually costs $749, but the current deal brings the price down to $648</a>, a record low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>GPU in the PS5 Pro has 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory than the base PS5</strong> and gives it the power to run demanding games at full 4K resolution without using upscaling tricks. You won’t have to choose between frame rate and resolution anymore when you play games that are optimized for the Pro because the Pro can handle both at the same time.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro enhancement patches for games like Spider-Man 2, Horizon Forbidden West, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <strong>unlock higher resolutions, better textures, and smoother performance that the base PS5 hardware</strong> can’t keep up with. You will immediately notice the difference in image clarity when there is a lot of movement or in detailed open-world environments where the standard PS5 drops resolution to keep performance up.</p>
<p>PlayStation <em>Spectral Super Resolution</em> is a custom <strong>AI-driven upscaling technology</strong> that looks at game images at the pixel level and reconstructs detail that is close to native 4K quality from lower resolution inputs. This machine learning method works differently from simple checkerboard rendering because it looks at how each pixel should look based on trained models instead of just filling in the gaps between existing pixels. <strong>PSSR lets games render at 1440p or 1800p internally and then upscale to 4K with very little loss of quality</strong>.</p>



<p>Dedicated hardware acceleration <strong>speeds up ray tracing calculations by up to three time</strong>s compared to the base console and makes ray tracing much better. Ray-traced reflections, shadows and global illumination effects that used to slow down frame rates on standard PS5 now run at playable speeds. This makes these visual improvements useful instead of just tech demos that you admire for a short time before turning them off.</p>
<p>The <strong>2TB internal SSD doubles the storage space of the first PS5 models</strong> which is good because modern games often take up more than 100GB with all their updates and DLC. With this extra storage, you can keep a dozen AAA games ready to play without having to delete and redownload them all the time based on what you want to play that night.</p>



<p>The <strong>console doesn’t come with a disc drive</strong> so you’ll have to buy games and movies digitally unless you spend $79 on Sony’s optional external drive. This choice keeps costs down, but it also means that there are no used game markets, no sharing games with friends, and no watching 4K Blu-rays without buying more.</p>
<p>The <strong>included DualSense controller has the same haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that made the PS5’s tactile experience stand out. These features set PlayStation apart from its competitors. The console has Wi-Fi 7, which makes downloads faster and streaming more stable. It also has USB-C ports on the front for easy charging of accessories.</p>
<p>The Pro costs only $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition when both are at full price, which is a very small premium for double the storage and much better performance. You’re getting hardware that will last for years and play the best settings on upcoming games, ray tracing features that make gameplay better instead of just screenshots, and instant upgrades to your current game library.</p>

Online, at least 3 million more watched the event via streaming platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Man, Superman, Godzilla and the KPop Demon Hunters were just some of the characters who made appearances within the event, as Fortnite's finest gathered to defeat the Dark Presence, the game's latest Big Bad. Many of the characters appearing in the event had been teased ahead of time, though exactly what would happen was left uncertain. And indeed, despite going multiple rounds with King Kong and a Star Destroyer, the Dark Presence was still left standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise of the event was quite how much Fortnite celebrated its own beloved lore, with the Dark Presence finally defeated thanks to a last-ditch decision by Jonesy to call in the game's  villainous Cube. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full Fortnite Zero Hour live event gameplay! 🎬</p><p>Epic just pulled off its own version of Avengers Endgame 🔥</p><p>How would you rate the event out of 10? 👀<a href="https://t.co/ifWqkeNKF6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ifWqkeNKF6</a></p></div>— Beebom Gaming (@beebomgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/beebomgaming/status/1994851824491532353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now sharing gameplay of the event and finding numerous Easter eggs, such as characters from Steal the Brainrot being featured in the background, and Hatsune Miku joining the battle while perched on Godzilla's head. I particularly love this fan creation, which overlays Avengers: Endgame's score on top of Zero Hour's "portals" sequence:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite Zero Hour Event (with Endgame Music)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteZeroHour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#FortniteZeroHour</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/6Jacvsq3px" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Jacvsq3px</a></p>— ABALDY (@ABaldy64) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABaldy64/status/1994857279796253165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty here, too, for Fortnite lore fans to digest. As Hope herself questioned, who was piloting the Mecha Team Leader mech? (A member of the Seven?) Will the destruction of the Cube lead to its mothership reappearing? (Yes, see below!) And how is Epic Games going to top this next year? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the event's gameplay portion complete, some players reported seeing their games abruptly crash as an unexpected cutscene began to air. The cinematic, which you can watch in full below, quickly sums up Fortnite's clearly now-revived original storyline and makes absolutely clear that the game is returning to its focus on its heroic Seven, and their battle against the Cube's civilization, dubbed The Last Reality.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, players were treated to a quick glimpse at what's next for the game (and yes, Epic Games couldn't resist making a 6-7 joke in the process). Fortnite Chapter 7 will begin with our heroes enjoying life on a new map themed around the southern US. There are Fortnite-y versions of Hollywood and Area 51 to explore, while fresh gameplay changes include wingsuits and drivable Reboot Vans. Everything seems pretty chill, until The Last Reality's mothership does indeed turn up (and promptly blows up Fortnite's beloved Battle Bus!)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And after <em>that</em>, for those still connected, Fortnite really did call it a day. The game is now offline for a number of hours, with the launch of Chapter 7 due as the game comes back online later tonight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
Crikey, it's been a long time coming, but it looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> is finally coming to a close… next year. Up until earlier this week, the fifth and final episode of The Long Dark's Wintermute DLC was due to be released by the end of the year. As you've probably gathered, the end of the year is very close now, so as a result, episode five has been delayed, but it is a delay that at least comes with a concrete release date.
</p>
<p>
The release date in question is March 31st, 2026, about four months away. Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hinterland">Hinterland</a> Studio explained the delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">Steam post</a> thusly: "While the majority of the episode content is now finished, there was just no way for us to wrap up the remaining cinematic work, the soundtrack, or complete the last bit of mission polish in time for the end of this year as we had originally planned. So we’re taking a couple of extra months to finish that work, then to optimize, fix the bugs, and get it ready for console certification and launch for the end of March."

<p>
With this delay and formal release date announcement came a new trailer too, showing off bits and pieces of what you can expect from episode five, which is titled The Light at the End of All Things. A bit of a wordy title, but, I suppose it goes with the emotional angle the trailer went for. It's just a lot of shots of scenery you'll presumably experience with a melancholic voice over, like a town next to a frozen lake, a boat at night time while an aurora borealis shines above, and some kind of radar station. The last bit of dialogue you hear is "nothing lasts forever," which, sheesh, that's a real bummer my guy!
</p><p>
In any case, while this might be the end of The Long Dark, it's not the end of The Long Dark (the series). About a year ago Hinterlands announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-2-announced-with-co-op-multiplayer-new-urban-areas-and-sanity-system">working on a sequel</a>, called Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 (can't tell you why Blackfrost isn't a subtitle, seems bad for branding, but what do I know). This one will feature things like co-op multiplayer, some urban areas, and a sanity system, so if this last episode of The Long Dark doesn't scratch certain itches for you, it's possible its sequel will.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley posted some mysterious images this morning. However, it seems fans have already&nbsp;started to figure out what those teases could be.</p>



<p>On December 11th, The Game Awards are set to go live on social media. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the event celebrates the best of the year’s games. This year is host to a plethora of amazing titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. However, in recent shows, it’s also been home to huge reveals like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. This morning, Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards’ socials posted <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird photos of a mysterious statue</a> and location. Now, it seems the mystery is going a bit deeper thanks to one fan’s journey to said locale.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-mysterious-statue-seen-in-real-life-hints-at-future-reveal">The Game Awards’ Mysterious Statue Seen in Real Life, Hints at Future Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned before, The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley released a picture of a statue and a desert location in New Mexico. Fans on Reddit speculated everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1p9uzuu/another_teaser_for_the_game_awards_do_you_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p9vgwx/dont_believe_his_lies_dont_believe_his_lies_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half-Life</a>. However, user <a href="https://x.com/TotallyNOTTrio/status/1994843343575224514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TotallyNOTTrio</a> noticed they lived not far from it and took a trip to the site. There, as pictured above, we get a closer look at the statue, which is adorned with demon-like creatures and a big yellow eye with tentacles. According to the user, the staff on location were quiet about what it could actually mean.</p>



<p>Luckily, it seems fans are already hard at work conjuring what it could be. The most likely consensus is that it’s for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s Saros</a>, as the visual design and architecture look similar to the upcoming Housemarque title. Perhaps a bit of a stretch, fans are hoping it’s referring to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-lefay-father-elder-scrolls-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, as both series have eldritch enemies and a similar visual style. Plus, the series are no strangers to The Game Awards, so the collaboration isn’t out of left field. Its fans are going crazy on Reddit, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/1p9vswt/this_geoff_post_on_twitter_what_you_guys_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">referencing the armor as one of Kratos</a>‘ and others believing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1p9nef1/youre_thinking_about_the_teaser_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it has a connection to Oblivion</a>.</p>



<p>Another one, Diablo 4, is another good choice, given it feels like it’s time for a new expansion, and the statue fits with something one could see in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1p9mf6w/geoff_keighley_dropped_this_new_expansion_or_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans on the subreddit</a> do think that, while it does go too far for an expansion, it could tease the Paladin class’s addition to the game. Additionally, it could very well be a new game from a big studio, given the marketing strategy. Unfortunately, it may be some time before it’s known what exactly it is, but it’s certainly one great way to market your game.</p>



<p>What do you think the statue is referring to? Saros? God of War? Elder Scrolls? Diablo? Another franchise? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Doom By Fate monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards and get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>If you’re afraid of the dark, then this game is definitely not for you. Quite clearly inspired by Dead By Daylight, Doom By Fate is a popular survival horror <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are thrown into short rounds in a dark place with a deadly killer on the loose. The main objective of the game is to survive through the night without getting killed, but that’s easier said than done. Although players have the option to jump and sprint, getting away from the killer is no easy task.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Surviving in a limited space when there’s a murderous killer on the loose is hard enough, but throw in the fact that you also have to complete objectives, and you have quite the challenge on your hands. Considering this, it’s essential for the players to try and coordinate to have the higest chance of surviving through the round. As expected, the killer’s job is simply to eliminate all of the players before the timer runs out. With a variety of playable survivor characters to unlock, Doom By Fate encourages grinding, as a lot of cash is required to make most purchases. This is where Doom By Fate codes can come to your rescue.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-doom-by-fate-codes">Active Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>DOOMEDBYFATE</strong> – Redeem this code to get free rewards</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-doom-by-fate-codes">Expired Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Doom By Fate, as the game only came out recently. It’s currently in Alpha, so more codes and content updates are likely on the horizon. The moment any of the active codes expire, they will promptly be moved to this section of the page. Moreover, players are urged to use the active codes and reap the rewards before they eventually expire.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-doom-by-fate-codes">How To Redeem Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Doom By Fate Codes Redemption Page

<p>Many Roblox games nowadays demand that players join the game’s <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/35983705/what-is-what-is#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roblox developer group</a> and like the game before unlocking the code redemption feature for them, and Doom By Fate falls into that category too. Once that’s done, however, redeeming codes is a simple process that requires next to no effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Doom By Fate.</li>



<li>Click on the Settings button at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.</li>



<li>Hit the Enter key to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-doom-by-fate-codes">How To Get More Doom By Fate Codes</h2>



<p>Considering that the game is still in alpha, it’s not surprising that there’s only one active code at the moment. However, the sheer amount of popularity that game has received means that more codes are surely on the horizon. New codes are released through the game’s socials and Discord server, so tracking both of those might be a good idea. A better idea though, would be to simply bookmark this page and check in every so often, as we update this article with new codes as soon as they drop.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill, was famously so long that it was split into two separate movies: Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel, Volume 2, released about half a year apart back in the early aughts. Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making.</p><p dir="ltr">Totally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. I recently attended the premiere of Yuki's Revenge at the packed Vista Theater in Los Angeles, alongside Tarantino and "The Bride" herself, Uma Thurman, who were on hand to debut this long-lost scene now that it's found its surprising home.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene, Tarantino explained after the showing, was always considered by him to have happened in the canon of the Kill Bill story. "The audience just didn't see it," he explained, as it wasn't feasible at that time for the cast and crew to film what is essentially another bloody fight scene in a movie already full of them. Its absence was known to film buffs and fans of the director <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/jvv8n/the_missing_chapter_of_kill_bill_yukis_revenge/" rel="nofollow ">going back years</a>, with many wishing it had made it into the movie originally.</p><p dir="ltr">Tarantino explained how Epic approached him ahead of Fortnite Chapter 7, interested to learn if he had any story ideas that they could produce together for the West Coast- and Hollywood-themed season, Pacific Break. Always looking to make a splash--for last year's big beat, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice played a surprise concert in Times Square--Epic wanted to roll out something from the famous director to promote Fortnite's new chapter, which will presumably span the next year if tradition holds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612472"></a><figcaption>Yuki's Revenge was once assumed lost to history. Instead, it lives on in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4612472-thelostchapter_yuki%27srevengeposter-1920x1080_en.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As it so happens, Tarantino revealed to the developer-publisher that he'd been sitting on a scene he'd dearly missed for 20+ years. The timing seemed impeccable. Epic would get its next big thing. Tarantino would close the book on something that he'd probably given up on making years ago. And so, somehow, Fortnite--where nothing really feels impossible anymore--is now home to a never-before-seen lost chapter from Quentin Tarantino's filmography.</p><p dir="ltr">Uma Thurman returned to provide voice and face capture for her starring role, and the vignette plays out much like the rest of the movie, but it's where it's not so faithful that I find it most interesting. Fortnite doesn't depict blood, so neither does Yuki's Revenge. There's also, naturally, a distinct lack of swear words that comes off as uncanny in a Tarantino-involved production. In the chapter's funniest recurring bit, characters other than The Bride and Yuki are depicted by Fortnite originals, like Peely, the bipedal banana and Skull Trooper, who spectates with a big bucket of popcorn in his lap while Kill Bill's violent femmes kick up dust in the streets.</p><p dir="ltr">The end result makes for a peculiar crossover, but one that illustrates Fortnite's unprecedented staying power. Epic has plans to grow Fortnite well beyond being the "battle royale" game, and we see these plans come to fruition on the perpetual treadmill of updates in the game, as the studio continues to rebuild Fortnite like the Ship of Theseus.</p><p dir="ltr">Things like Fortnite Festival and Creative mode illustrate this to a certain audience--those already logging in to play video games. But as the studio continues exploring what "Fortnite" even means, not just today, but 10 years from now, this lost chapter from Kill Bill provides another vantage point into that future. Fortnite can be a battle royale game. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-5v5-first-person-ballistic-mode-is-now-live/1100-6528379/" data-ref-id="1100-6528379">Counter-Strike</a>. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wont-call-this-fortnite-2-but-it-feels-that-way-to-me/1100-6519829/" data-ref-id="1100-6519829">Rock Band, or Minecraft, or Mario Kart</a>. It can be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ariana-grande-rift-tour-watch-it-here/1100-6494920/" data-ref-id="1100-6494920">an Ariana Grande concert</a>. It can be a 20-year-in-the-making lost chapter from Kill Bill, too. What is Fortnite? Increasingly, Fortnite is whatever it wants to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Yuki's Revenge debuts in Fortnite on November 30.</p>

            <p>
When I first caught a very quick glimpse at Into the Fire, the kind of glimpse where you more just see a character design amidst a bunch of fire, I thought it was a new simulation game. A fireman <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>, that kind of thing, the kind of game I'm sure exists already without needing to Google it. Into the Fire is not that at all. There is fire, and there is rescue, but there are also ancient mysteries amongst natural disasters, fiery, destructive jellyfish-esque spirits, and a tantalizing mix of science-fiction, folklore, and the supernatural.
</p>
<p>
Remember The Invincible? Well, Into the Fire is from the same devs, and while our newly anointed editorial director Julian had some misgivings about The Invincible in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">review</a> at the time, my curiosity with Starward Industries' next has still been piqued. Details are quite light on who you are in Into the Fire, apart from the fact that you're a "bold explorer struggling to survive during a volcanic eruption on Dante’s Archipelago." Hang on… have we got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hell-maiden-makes-a-compelling-case-for-mixing-hades-vampire-survivors-anime-and-uh-dantes-divine-comedy">yet another</a> Divine Comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dantes-epic-poem-la-divina-commedia-is-getting-turned-into-a-videogame-again">adaptation</a> on our hands here? I suppose time will tell.
</p>
<p>
The core loop appears to be this: there is a hub, seemingly nearish to said volcano, where you can do bits of crafting and upgrading, rest a bit, find some lore, and choose your equipment before heading out on missions. Your equipment looks like quite standard firefighting stuff, like a big ole axe, and a fire extinguisher attached to your back that you spray across fires to put them out.
</p>
<p>
For the missions themselves, things look tricky, based on the game's latest trailer (as seen above). There's those aforementioned sort of jellyfish fire spirits you have to fend off, amongst others for one. But there's also the rescuing people. This isn't like, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, where you can foist them on your backpack, you actually have to carry them, and that might mean across thin planks of wood above a burning pit. Amongst the action it looks like there is a borderline puzzley navigational element that'll put your quick mapping skills and reflexes to the test.
</p><p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this game other than sometime in 2026, but whenever it does launch it'll do so in early access. In the meantime, you can wishlist Into the Fire here if it takes your fancy.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Servers Down For Chapter 7 Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-servers-down-for-chapter-7-launch/</link>
            <guid>1368250</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortner servers are down ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, following the huge end-of-chapter event that marked an end to the previous chapter.</p>



<p>The Zero Point live event was stacked with collabs, including the likes of Godzilla, Hatsune Miku, and Homer Simpson, and servers immediately went offline after the conclusion of the event in preparation for Chapter 7’s launch.</p>



<p>Taking the Fortnite servers down immediately was an unexpected move by many, considering the usual start time of downtime for new content is at 2 AM ET, but Epic Games announced the downtime in advance of the event to give players a heads up.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-downtime-end">When Will Fortnite Downtime End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big drop. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1994771674793996483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> ahead of the event, Epic Games stated that downtime would commence immediately after the event’s conclusion, and in-game, a precise countdown was shared.</p>



<p>Fittingly for Chapter 7, downtime will last four seven hours, and there is a live countdown available in-game. That downtime is a similar length to what was witnessed prior to the launch of Chapter 6, though there could still be server issues when the season commences.</p>



<p>A host of players complained on social media of being disconnected during the live event, which had over 10 million active players watching the action, and server instability may be present when Chapter 7 first kicks off.</p>



<p>It will be late in the evening in the United States, however, and the middle of the night for Europe, which may reduce the flood of players heading into the game immediately when servers return.</p>



<p>During downtime, several prominent content creators will be publishing footage from an early access Chapter 7 launch event, similar to what was seen ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s biggest day of the year started off with a massive live event that wrapped up Chapter 6, and if all goes well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7/2900-7289/" data-ref-id="2900-7289">Chapter 7</a> will begin very soon. In the meantime, though, Fortnite's servers are offline for maintenance and to deploy the Chapter 7 update. There's no bug here--Fortnite is offline on purpose. But it shouldn't be down for long.</p><p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em> Servers are back online as of 4:30 PM PT. Chapter 7 has begun!</p><h2>When will Fortnite Chapter 7 start?</h2><p>In the past, the start of a new chapter came with longer periods of downtime--like a day or more--but these days Epic tends to treat new season and new chapter updates the same as it would a regular mid-month patch. That means you can expect Fortnite to be offline for between 4 and 7 hours, with Chapter 7 likely launching <strong>in the evening on Saturday, November 29, likely around 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET</strong>--primetime, in other words.</p><p>We guarantee nothing, however, as these launches don't always go smoothly. Just a month ago, when the Simpsons season began, all seemed well when Fortnite returned from maintenance--but after an hour, the servers crashed and the game went back offline for a while. And there was another update earlier this year that ended up taking Fortnite offline for an entire additional day. But such incidents are rare, and most updates go off without major hitches.</p><p>When Chapter 7 launches, it'll come with a pretty loaded battle pass, teased by Epic to feature Marty McFly from Back to the Future and Beatrix "The Bride" Kiddo from Kill Bill.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the premium headphone market, big names like Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats compete with each other by offering different features and prices to different types of listeners. The <strong>Beats Solo 4 is the perfect choice if you want great sound quality, spatial head tracking, and modern connectivity features</strong> without having to pay extra for active noise cancellation.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday weekend, Amazon has the lowest price ever on this model which competes directly with models that cost a lot more: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The regular price is $199, but it’s now only $129</a>. Instead of cramming in every possible tech feature, they focused on battery life, comfort, and sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long battery life and compatibility with all devices</h2>
<p>Beats designed the <strong>Solo 4 to last up to 50 hours on a single charge</strong> which changes the way you use wireless headphones all week long. You can fly across the country several times, go to work every day for two weeks or binge-watch entire TV shows without having to look for a charging cable. The USB-C charging port has fast fuel technology that lets you <strong>play for 5 hours on a 10-minute charge</strong> when you’re running late. The <strong>Solo 4 connects to both iOS and Android devices</strong> via Bluetooth so you don’t have to worry about being stuck in one ecosystem if you switch between platforms for work and play.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm drivers in each ear cup make Beats’ “custom acoustic platform,”</strong> which adjusts the frequency response to give you strong bass without drowning out vocals and instruments in the mid and high ranges. You will be able to hear the thump of kick drums and bass lines clearly while still being able to understand every word in podcasts or other content with a lot of dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make listening more immersive by tying sound to your device instead of your head movements. When you turn your head while watching a movie, the sound stays in the same place on the screen, just like it does in a real theater. This feature turns on automatically when you play content that works with it on Apple devices and some Android phones.</p>
<p>To fix the comfort issues that plagued earlier Solo models during long wear sessions, Beats changed the headband and ear cushions: The very light construction spreads pressure more evenly over your head, and the soft foam cushions make a tight seal without the vice-grip feeling that gives you headaches after an hour. The on-ear design folds flat into a small shape that fits easily into backpacks or carry-on bags.</p>



<p>The matte black finish doesn’t show fingerprints and scratches as easily as glossy finishes, which show every smudge within hours of opening the box. <strong>Beats comes with a 3.5mm audio cable</strong> so you can connect to older devices that don’t have Bluetooth or keep listening when the battery dies after a long time of use.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal brings the price of the Solo 4 down from $199 to $129 and puts it in direct competition with budget models that give up battery life, build quality, or platform compatibility. You’re getting a high-end Beats product for less than what many mid-range brands charge, plus the brand recognition and customer service that come with owning an Apple product.</p>
