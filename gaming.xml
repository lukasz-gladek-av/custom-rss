		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is one of the most anticipated games of the year, with Techland’s iconic zombie saga continuing to capture fans’ imaginations. That’s never been more obivous than today, with the game hitting 1 million pre-orders. In return for this incredible milestone, Polish developer Techland are dishing out a bunch of free gifts for everyone that has pre-ordered the game. It’s not too late though, as they’re extending this offer to everyone who pre-orders before the game’s launch on the 18th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What are these free gifts? The first is the APEX Car Skin, featuring a striking glow-in-the-dark design that the team says, “Makes every ride through Castor Woods unforgettable”, on top of the Hero of Harran Bundle. The Hero of Harran Bundle will be available from launch, while the APEX Car Skin will appear a couple of days later on the 20th of September.</p>
<p>That’s not all, though! Players who pre-order before the launch will also receive the exclusive Kyle Crane skin, inspired by his iconic look from the original Dying Light. This tribute will be fully revealed before the game’s launch and unlocked shortly after the game goes live. </p>
<p>We got to check out Dying Light: The Beast just over a year ago at Gamescom, and we loved what we saw. The name might be a bit of a giveaway, but it’s become apparent that The Beast is actually you. Thanks to his incarceration and subsequent experimentation, Kyle Crane has developed a series of beast-like powers, coming to the fore when he’s pushed to the limit. These manifest when he’s angry – you wouldn’t like him when he’s angry – though in gameplay terms, that seems to be when he’s been taken and/or dished out a certain amount of damage.</p>


<p>The game takes place in a new open-world region that’s not appeared in the franchise before, with a central campaign that’s set to give you over 18 hours of standalone zombie action. Techland feel this is the sweet spot in terms of narrative and gameplay content, though as an open-world game, there’s undoubtedly going to be plenty to distract you from what you’re doing.</p>
<p>We can’t wait for Dying Light: The Beast, and it seems like neither can most of you!</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Destiny: The Taken King is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, September 15, 2025. Below, we look back at how it came to represent the years of Destiny, and live-service games more broadly, that would follow.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Ten years ago, Bungie performed a miracle. It also, unfortunately, invoked a curse.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2014, the studio renowned for the Halo franchise launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny</a>, which promised to blend its penchant for dynamic single-player campaigns and kinetic multiplayer gameplay with the framework and community-oriented features of MMOs. And while the game was released to an excited and impressionable audience, it floundered. Its opening salvo felt limp and incomplete--a sentiment that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731" rel="nofollow ">later reporting</a> would confirm--but it maintained a playerbase through a spate of smaller middling DLC releases leading up to The Taken King, Destiny's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-the-taken-king-review/1900-6416250/">first major expansion and saving grace</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Taken King launched on September 15, 2015 and--I say this without exaggeration--revolutionized the game, which felt aimless till its arrival. Destiny's worlds, while large and beautiful, felt quiet and devoid of life. Its cast felt more like disparate archetypes thrown in a blender than a cohesive company. And its paper-thin plot...well, it was just that. Destiny wasn't without merit--it excelled in gunplay, boasted an art style that blended sci-fi and fantasy seamlessly, and the level design of its strikes and raids were still exemplary--but all of that felt pointed at nothing in particular. The Taken King whipped it into shape.</p><p dir="ltr">From its opening mission through to the riotous end of its raid, The Taken King was sharp in a way the initial release of Destiny could only ever dream of. For 10 years now, I've been struck by the construction of the expansion's first level, where the player must mount a defense of a besieged base on Phobos, and how much livelier it felt than anything Destiny had done in the year prior. Small touches, like an enemy ship cresting over a hill and shining its spotlight on the player, as well as the sights and sounds of explosions in the distance, finally broke up the almost glacial front that permeated Destiny's destinations. It was like throwing a rock into still water.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1973231118" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

It breathed life into characters that could've fallen by the wayside, like Eris Morn. It provided a bounty of secrets nestled in the crevices of the Dreadnaught. Hell, it even gave players a quest log! It cannot be overstated how amorphous Destiny felt before The Taken King's arrival, and how wonderful it felt to bask in it for the weeks and months to come. It hadn't just come to life, but become even larger in scope. At last, I felt like I was taking part in the epic struggle between light and darkness that Destiny had been billed as while I flitted through the cosmos and used my spectacular powers and weaponry to live out the adventures of my dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">For all intents and purposes, Destiny had mounted the comeback it needed. With some narrative direction and goodwill on its side, it had enough gas to continue its ascent. So what curse could I possibly have been referring to earlier?</p><p dir="ltr">The unfortunate problem with Destiny is that it never stopped needing saving. If you're at all familiar with the arc of the series, you may be tangentially aware of the bumpy road the games, as well as the company behind it, have been on ever since. For every high--every Taken King or Forsaken, which came at a similar time in Destiny 2's lifetime--there have been some standout lows. Unfortunately, while Destiny's history is marked by a long line of comebacks, it's just as stained by these immense valleys, brought on often by frequent retooling and reinvention that steadily eroded any ground which could provide it stable footing. And even though Destiny had proven, much like Rainbow Six Siege and No Man's Sky, that a live-service game could bounce back, it also stood as proof positive of how volatile ongoing games could be. It has typified the often harsh ebb and flow of the model.</p><p dir="ltr">You see, Destiny never really enjoyed a sense of stability. While Bungie devised a way forward for its ambitious series, the games suffered content droughts that turned its community against the game at several points in its lengthy lifetime. To solve this problem, Bungie figured out a cadence and template for content drops, like expansions, title updates, and seasonal events, that would supplement the community and feed the machine.</p><p dir="ltr">We often talk about the live-service treadmill from the perspective of the consumer, which is always a helpful viewpoint to contextualize its impact and potential harm. But what often feels under-discussed is the effect that this work has on the people who make the content for these never-ending games. And while some titles, like Epic Games' Fortnite, seemingly have the capital to throw armies at the thing, the same isn't true of every team.</p><p dir="ltr">The cadence of releases under the Destiny banner have seemed increasingly exhaustive on the workforce producing it, especially when factoring in the constant expectations for the next additions to the game to be bigger and better. The live-service treadmill isn't the only thing killing Destiny though. Paired with the mismanagement of the studio under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/longtime-bungie-boss-pete-parsons-announces-departure-after-two-decades/1100-6534197/">previous leadership</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/">toxic workplace culture</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">constant layoffs</a> and reinventions--some better than others--it's no surprise that Destiny's lineage is riddled with instability.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes that cadence of releases meant that game-changing updates like The Taken King would shake things up for the better. But just as often, it meant that the realities of developing such a big expansion for Destiny caught up with the team behind it. Things fell short. Other expansions like Rise of Iron or Beyond Light felt half-baked, even if they were well-intentioned. Seasons, which were introduced in Destiny 2, felt like a bit of triage that allayed many storytelling and content woes but opened up another can of worms entirely over the years due to repetitive tasks and the removal of seasonal content. Some system-level changes, like reworks to classes, were welcome while others, like the introduction of the Portal, were not. The gulf between Destiny releases has often left a lot to be desired and it has meant that for every two steps that Destiny appeared to take, it would constantly take one back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568253"></a><figcaption>Destiny: The Taken King</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Where does The Taken King fall into this, exactly? Well, it arguably set the bar pretty high for what Destiny releases should be, and though Bungie has lived up to that promise a few times over the 10-plus years it's worked on the series, these ambitions have made for just as many misses as there have been hits.</p><p dir="ltr">It established an unfortunate rhythm of Bungie amending its errors, showing unprecedented strength, and then showing how that hubris could just as easily be the studio's undoing. Like clockwork, Bungie has spent the last decade and change stepping on rakes and bouncing back better than ever only to further upset the balance of things in Destiny and inadvertently step on another five rakes, which only landed there by the studio's own actions.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unfair to place the blame for Destiny's unevenness on one its earliest and best expansions. It would be a mischaracterization of the DLC and the intent behind it. The Taken King isn't a stain on Destiny's legacy because it's too good. That's a ridiculous thing to propose. But it certainly did set the game and the team behind it on a trajectory that has, at the very least, proved untenable for the studio and the health of the game in the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">So for all the good that Taken King did Destiny by saving it back then, it's hard to deny that it has made for a tough act to follow, and chasing it after its highs has indelibly marked the studio. It is simultaneously emblematic of the best Destiny would offer, and the lows it would constantly have to recover from.</p>

The Straw Hats don’t preach, but their presence sparks rebellion, liberation, and emotional reckoning for the oppressed they befriend on their journey for the series’ eponymous treasure.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Luffy Punches a Celestial Dragon | One Piece" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX2EfnTc_Eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Throughout their journey, the crew has confronted:</p><ul><li><span>Institutional abuse perpetuated by the Marines, AKA the world’s in-universe cops</span></li><li><span>Fake news and propaganda used to discourage political revolutionaries and scholars from <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Void_Century" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempting to learn from the past</a>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>War crimes and systemic violence to force people to conform to the government’s rule lest they be on the receiving end of <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Buster_Call" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buster Call, </a>AKA a nuke.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Slavery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slavery</a>, <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Race#Racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racism</a>, and <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Ohara_Incident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genocide</a>, especially in arcs like <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fish-Man_Island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fishman Island</a> and <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Water_7_Arc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Water Seven</a></span></li><li><span>Religious authoritarianism</span></li></ul><div><figure><p><iframe title="Declaration of War | One Piece" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2mO_XFiXKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>One Piece</em> may wear the visage of a goofy pirate adventure for kids, but beneath the slapstick and camaraderie lies a sprawling, serialized rebellion against injustice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-ad-drone-scene-horrible-bad-review-2000614752">Amazon quietly released a new film version of H.G. Wells’ <em>The </em><em>War of the Worlds.</em></a> The movie, in which everything we see is happening on computer screens, stars Ice Cube and was a huge flop with critics. It featured a scene where the world is saved thanks to an Amazon drone driver. Seriously. Now, a month later, the rapper and actor has explained how the internet’s favorite bad movie of 2025 came to be.</p> <p>During a recent livestream marathon hosted by popular creator <a href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-ptsd-30-day-stream-no-break-hot-ones-twitch-1851786038">Kai Cenat</a>, Ice Cube dropped by to talk about his career, his future projects, and just shoot the shit with Cenat and his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/4sVR6klSZyM?t=827">At one point during the stream</a>, Cenat asked Ice Cube about Amazon’s <em>War of the Worlds.</em> And while Cenat didn’t call it a terrible movie, it was clear that Ice Cube wasn’t particularly happy about the finished product, which apparently was shot half a decade ago in about two weeks.</p>  <p>“[<em>War of the Worlds</em> is a movie] I did in 2020 during the pandemic, five years ago,” Ice Cube told Cenat during the marathon stream. “We shot it in 15 days, and it was during the pandemic. So, the director wasn’t in there. None of the actors was in there. This was the only way we could really shoot the movie. [It was] pandemic time.”</p>

 <p>Ice Cube added that this is the reason <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-war-of-the-worlds-features-a-head-scratching-twist-2000636929"><em>War of the Worlds</em></a> is presented entirely as a series of computer screens. He then added: “But really, if shit went down, everybody would only have their screen to look at.”</p> <p>As for why the movie took five years to release, Ice Cube provided an odd answer, telling <a href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-streamer-university-tylil-james-twitch-1851783206">Kai Cenat</a> that after Universal sold the movie to Amazon Prime, it “took a minute to finish” the film because of “how it was shot.”</p> <p>“The movie is shot, the actors are shot, but all the footage is from real surveillance cameras around the world,” claimed Ice Cube. “And they had to build all that shit. So yeah, it took a minute.”</p> <p>As someone who has watched the movie and flipped through it a few times, I think a lot of the footage featured in it is actually stock footage or content licensed cheaply from some asset library.&nbsp; But hey, maybe they really did fly around the world collecting original security camera footage for this straight-to-digital low-budget adaptation of a classic novel. That’s possible, too, I guess…?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Genshin Impact is introducing a brand-new bloom support with Lauma, an important character in the new Nod-Krai region, as she serves as the Moonchant Envoy of the Frostmoon Scion faction. She’s also one of the most mechanically interesting characters released so far, and allows for two very distinct support playstyles depending on what team she’s in. This makes her a little trickier to build, but we’re here to help.</p>
<p><iframe title="Character Teaser - &quot;Lauma: Crown of Sacred Silver&quot; | Genshin Impact #GenshinImpact #Lauma" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXRck6wMgyg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Build</h3>
<p>Lauma changes up the bloom reaction and causes the cores to become lunar bloom cores. This, weirdly, doesn’t change anything at all about the reaction, unlike how Ineffa affected electro-charged. However, these new cores do generate something called Verdant Dew, which Lauma can consume with her skill to buff it, generate Moon Song, reduce enemy resistance to dendro and hydro, and then if she uses her burst, she’ll change the Moon Song into Pale Hymn. Pale Hymn allows the bloom reactions to be buffed by a portion of Lauma’s elemental mastery. That all sounds complicated, but basically you want to make the bloom reaction with Lauma, then use her skill, then burst.</p>


<p>One key thing to note here is that one of her passive talents changes her playstyle dramatically depending on the team composition. If Lauma is the only Nod-Krai character on your team, she’ll allow bloom, hyperbloom, and burgeon to crit, with a fixed rate of 15% crit rate and 100% crit damage. This stacks with Nahida’s C2, but only the crit rate. If there are two or more Nod-Krai characters, then Lauma will buff lunar-bloom damage. At present, only Lauma can do lunar-bloom damage though, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Weapon</h3>
<p>This is the simplest part of the guide. Lauma’s best weapon is her signature weapon, Nightweaver’s Looking Glass, which boosts elemental mastery by a lot, and also boosts bloom damage and lunar-bloom damage even more. However, you can use any weapon with a lot of elemental mastery with Lauma and still get a lot out of it. The best of these is the event weapon for this patch, the Blackmarrow Lantern, which does a lot of what her signature weapon does, but with lower stats.</p>

<h3>Genshin Impact Lauma Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>While Lauma always wants elemental mastery, the specific stats you want differ with playstyle as above. If she’s the only Nod-Krai character, you’re generally going to want all elemental mastery pieces on her, albeit with a decent amount of energy recharge, usually in the 150% range. Her set for this build can be anything really, but both Gilded Dreams and Deepwood Memories are good options.</p>
<p>If she’s one of two or more Nod-Krai characters, then you’ll want to swap an elemental mastery piece out for a crit damage or crit rate piece, and you’ll want to go with the brand-new Silen Moon’s Serenade set on her. This set boosts energy recharge, and also boosts elemental mastery and lunar reactions as well, and it works off-field. This set is likely to be good throughout the region of Nod-Krai, so farming it and the other new set will serve you well anyway. With that done though, you’re ready to get out there and bloom with the best Lauma build you can find.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Borderlands 4 PC Performance Fiasco, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last week to big numbers and mostly positive reviews on Steam. But there’s been a lot of chatter and debate online about the looter shooter’s performance. Some players aren’t happy that <em>Borderlands 4</em> seemingly requires DLSS and frame generation to run decently, even on the highest-end hardware. Meanwhile, Gearbox co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has defended the game’s performance, calling it “<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">pretty damn optimal</a>,” and suggested people need to use the “tools” provided by the studio and accept some trade-offs.</p> <p>On PC, many games can utilize real-time upscaling tech, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Learning_Super_Sampling">Nvidia’s DLSS</a> and AMD’s FSR. Nvidia and others have also created tools that allow your GPU to fill in the gaps between real frames rendered by the game with frames generated using deep learning tech. When this kind of tech was first introduced about six years ago or so, players complained that DLSS and other tools made games look blurry, even if it led to some performance boosts. As DLSS and similar tech have improved, the images produced looked have better and better. Today, DLSS 4.0 can produce some truly sharp-looking frames and provide some big performance gains, assuming you have a powerful enough video card.</p> <p>But some, myself included, have started to grow concerned that studios are building games around DLSS and other similar tech, and aren’t optimizing them in the way devs did in the past. When DLSS was introduced, it felt like a great tool for gamers who had a slightly older card but still wanted to play a newer game. It would let them squeeze out a bit more performance without shelling out for a pricey upgrade. Now it seems like newer games running on more advanced engines require users to turn on DLSS and frame gen to play. And so enters <em>Borderlands 4,</em> a game that has found itself at the center of this heated debate.</p>

 <p>Shortly after <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched, players on PC began to complain that the game didn’t run very well. Gearbox responded with some updates that, at least in my experience with the game on PC, helped a bit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190?emclan=103582791474679148&amp;emgid=679602429802577921">The company also released a guide from Nvidia</a> for how to optimize the game based on your GPU and settings. And while that helped some reach better performance on PC, many others, myself included, were struggling to get the game to run well on powerful hardware. I’m rocking a 5080, and even playing the game at 1080p on medium settings led to tons of FPS drops, even while trying to play at 60FPS. That all changed when I did as Gearbox and Nvidia suggest and turned on DLSS and frame gen. Now, I can run <em>Borderlands 4</em> at a mostly locked 120 with most settings set to high and medium. It looks nice and plays fine, but many aren’t okay with a game in 2025 being unable to run on high-end hardware without some upscaling assistance.</p> <p>Not helping matters is the fact that Randy Pitchford posted, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">as part of a recent and lengthy thread on Twitter</a>, that people should use DLSS because it’s “great” and added: <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055">“The game was built to take advantage of it.”</a> That, and a different part of the thread claiming it was acceptable for devs to focus on “default settings” reaching only 30FPS, didn’t go over well with a lot of PC gamers who specifically buy new parts and upgrade their rigs to achieve high framerates at high resolutions. For many, Pitchford’s claim that <em>Borderlands 4</em> was developed to “take advantage” of DLSS was him confirming that it was built with the assumption that most users would use DLSS. And that, to some, sounds a lot like the game wasn’t properly optimized to run without help from DLSS and frame generation.</p>

 <p>While I do agree that newer DLSS and frame gen tools are powerful and impressive, it feels weird that<em> Borderlands 4,</em> along with other games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, demand that even users with the highest-end hardware lean on upscaling tech to play at decent settings and historically popular framerates like 120. In a recent video, the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><em>Digital Foundry</em> weren’t impressed with <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC, with one even saying: “[<em>Borderlands 4</em>] does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”</p> <p>Pitchford has promised on Twitter that more updates are coming, including some more improvements to how the game runs on PC. He’s also been spending a lot of time online <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">helping people improve how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">claiming that performance issues are not as widespread</a> as some might make you believe. Personally, I just miss when games could run on a high-end computer packed with powerful hardware without needing four different upscaling tools. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/597391905481847754/?l=portuguese&amp;ctp=6">And it seems I’m not alone</a>.</p>

In several cases, Amazon’s pricing has dipped under TCGPlayer’s, which is usually the lowest benchmark for sealed product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31krq?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unova Poster Collection is $39.98 on Amazon</a> versus <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxxqjm?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$28.77 on TCGPlayer</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XynY?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin is $33.28 at Amazon</a> compared to <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31krK?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$24.87 on TCGPlayer</a>.

You're buying it from Amyet's official store on AliExpress. It ships free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks. You'd be hard pressed to find a new electric bike for under $500 stateside, especially one that has a 1,000W motor (the least expensive bikes cost more and are usually rated for 750W).

The vast majority of booster packs, tins, and trainer boxes are sitting cheaper there than on Amazon, often by $5-$15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bundles like the<a href="https://zdcs.link/av3rj0?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> White Flare Binder Collection</a> and the S<a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6WqY?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</a> are up to $40 off, deals that everyone should be snapping up right now.

Right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVYkD?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black Bolt Booster Bundle is available for $50.01 on Amazon</a>, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKMY5?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Flare Booster Bundle has dipped under $46</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors looking for nostalgic sets can also snag the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMmOe?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket Tin at $41.24,</a> or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxqjY?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Pokémon Stacking Tin at $26.32</a>.

The clear winner is Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195, which has surged 68% since July to $427, cementing itself as the set’s chase card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery standouts like Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 and Blaziken VMAX TG15/TG30 have also doubled or tripled in value thanks to strong artwork and nostalgia, while even Lugia VSTAR continues climbing on competitive strength. At the same time, cards like Regidrago V (Alternate Art) and Alolan Vulpix VSTAR have cooled as the meta shifted away from them, with values slipping back toward the $12–$14 range. </p><p id="snag-classic-mega-evolution-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards">Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards Before Market Rise</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market for XY-era Mega Evolution Pokémon cards is heating up fast ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the upcoming Mega Evolution TCG set. Collectors aren’t waiting for modern reprints, they’re chasing the originals, and prices are showing it. Some cards have exploded in value, while others have steadied after sharp climbs, creating both momentum plays and entry points for buyers. Leading the surge is M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art - Ancient Origins), which has skyrocketed over 426% this year, from $275 in January to $1,450 today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare - Phantom Forces) isn’t far behind, up nearly fivefold to $415, cementing its place as one of the most sought-after Megas. Other heavy-hitters include M Rayquaza EX (Full Art - Roaring Skies), now at $656, M Charizard EX (X - Flashfire) climbing past $349, and Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art), which has more than doubled to $349. These climbers show how nostalgia, unique mechanics, and iconic artwork are driving a collector frenzy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not every Mega Evolution is running away in price. Some cards have plateaued after strong early-year gains, leaving a rare buying window before the next spike. M Mewtwo EX (Full Art - BREAKthrough) climbed from $37 to $145 but has leveled off in recent weeks, while M Alakazam EX (Full Art - Fates Collide) sits steady just under $100 after jumping from $28 earlier this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Charizard is showing signs of cooling, M Charizard EX (Generations) and M Charizard EX (Full Art - Evolutions) have tripled since January but are holding in the $190-$200 range for now. These pauses don’t signal weakness; rather, they reflect consolidation before the broader Mega Evolution wave hits with new set releases. For collectors and investors, the message is clear: the grails are climbing fast, but the plateaued cards may be the smarter pickups before Mega hype takes over the market again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Crown Zenith Prices Are Rising</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crown Zenith market has been showing two very different stories this month. On one hand, several Galarian Gallery Ultra Rares are slipping as hype fades, with fan-favorites like Leafeon VSTAR and Suicune V dropping more than 20% from their peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, the gold Secret Rares are climbing steadily, led by Giratina VSTAR and Arceus VSTAR, as collectors chase the scarce, high-end pieces of the set. This split reflects a maturing market: casual collectors are less interested in mid-tier Eeveelutions and V cards, while serious players and investors are doubling down on the big four golds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the crashers, Leafeon VSTAR has fallen from nearly $50 to the $43 range, and Glaceon VSTAR is down 26% since February, hovering in the mid-$30s. Deoxys VMAX has slipped under $37, while Suicune V and Raikou V both lost more than a quarter of their value since spring. These are still striking artworks, but set fatigue and limited competitive relevance are pushing prices down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the climbers are commanding all the attention. Giratina VSTAR (Secret) has surged nearly 20% since July to $180, making it the definitive chase of Crown Zenith. Mewtwo VSTAR is also up more than 30% this summer, with its Charizard battle artwork driving collector demand. Rounding out the gains, Arceus VSTAR, Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR, and Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR are all trending higher as well, thanks to their powerful abilities and limited supply. Taken together, the set still holds broad collector appeal, but it’s clear the market is consolidating around the golden Secret Rares as the safest long-term holds.</p><p id="first-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="First Party Switch 2 Preorders">First Party Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s 2025 first-party lineup is shaping up to be one of its strongest in years. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set to arrive in October, followed closely by Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 bundled together for Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in December, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond lands with its own set of new amiibo figures, alongside Kirby’s big return in Kirby Air Riders. Between new entries in cornerstone franchises and fresh collectible amiibo launches, fans will have plenty to keep their Switch 2 libraries stocked through the holidays.</p><p id="third-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Third Party Switch 2 Preorders">Third Party Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The third-party slate for Switch 2 is just as impressive, with several big franchises making the jump to the new hardware. Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection launches in December with a full set of classic fighters, while Borderlands 4 and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake hit this fall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, titles like Hades II, Octopath Traveler 0, and Cronos round out the lineup for RPG fans. Whether you’re into fighters, shooters, or sprawling JRPGs, the Switch 2’s preorder catalog already feels packed, and today’s deals cover every one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p>Between now and the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> next month, Battlefield Studios and its developers will be working to refine the game based on what was learned during the recent beta test. Players have already shared their responses to the beta with some bitingly funny memes, including some about the game's sniper flare. The Battlefield 6 team has seen those pics, and they think they're hilarious.</p><p>Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson recently spoke with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> about the upcoming release. When asked about the memes, Buhl admitted to laughing at them while also taking their points to heart.</p><p>"I saw those ... I thought it was hilarious," said Buhl. "Obviously, we needed to fix some things and tune some things, so it was funny to see players react in a humorous way to those things, but also great to get that feedback and say, 'We need to tune down snipers or we need to change the glints so it's not like…' you know? I saw those memes with the hillside just full of these giant glares."</p><p>Nickerson added that the design team shares the memes internally, and he praised the effort made by fans to address the issues of the game through humor.</p><p>"They're really, really funny, and they kind of magnify, 'Hey, we still have work to do,'" said Nickerson. "For example, with the sniper glint stuff, we knew it was too strong, so we stepped it back. We knew the bullet tracer effect was too strong, so we stepped it back ... At the end of the day, it keeps us honest. It keeps us, like, 'Hey, we still have work to do. There are things that players are, maybe, not vibing with or are vibing with in different capacities.' ... From a design standpoint and from the team, we love this stuff. The community is engaged; we are engaged."</p><p>In the same interview, Nickerson addressed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-battlefield-6-is-approaching-locked-vs-open-class-weapons/1100-6534752/" data-ref-id="1100-6534752"> the team's approach to open class weapons and locked weapons</a>, and shared the team's desire to let the players decide.

Wonder is getting a Switch 2 Edition</a>, and now fans think Nintendo may have accidentally revealed Rosalina will become new playable character.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer for the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder that premiered during the most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/" data-ref-id="2900-7026">Nintendo Direct</a> focused on the addition of Bellabel Park, a collection of multiplayer minigames exclusive to the Switch 2 version where players can either team up or compete against each other. One eagle-eyed fan, <a href="https://x.com/DynamoSuperX/status/1966516009780539646" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DynamoSuperX on X</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-unannounced-character-in-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-trailer?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c85b6db5e33600016f55c4&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), spotted a vs minigame icon at around the 2:00 minute mark in the trailer that clearly shows an image of Yoshi next to Rosalina, seemingly confirming her inclusion in the upcoming rerelease of the platformer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQNAdzmlauc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hQNAdzmlauc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rosalina isn't in the original version of the game. However, Nintendo did state during the trailer that there would be additional new content coming to the Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but that it would share more details at a later date. It certainly seems like Rosalina might be one of the surprises Nintendo was looking to keep under wraps until closer to the game's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Her inclusion would make sense given Nintendo's all-in push for Super Mario Galaxy. Nintendo during its latest direct announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-and-super-mario-galaxy-2-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-october/1100-6534691/" data-ref-id="1100-6534691">remastered versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2</a> are coming this year and that the name of Universal's Super Mario Bros.

              <p><i>Silksong</i> spent seven long years in development. While developer Team Cherry spent cooking up the wildly anticipated sequel, it also met with Seth Goldman, a fan who was battling cancer in 2020. After meeting with him, Team Cherry promised to include a character of Seth’s own design, directly named after him. Seth unfortunately lost his battle with cancer, but his memory lives on in <i>Silksong</i>. Now that the game is finally out, players have sought out and encountered Seth, <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Seth">immortalized as a boss</a> awaiting players in a hidden area.</p> <p>Taking to Reddit six years ago, user big_boi878, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/ftoylt/i_made_a_character_for_silksong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Seth, announced</a> that after meeting Team Cherry thanks to the <a href="https://martylyonsfoundation.org/">Marty Lyons Foundation</a>, a character of his own design would end up in the game. “He’s really cool and has a boss fight,” Seth Goldman wrote six years ago.“I named him after myself (Seth) […] I can’t wait for you to see him, and see his cool lore and design and gameplay.”</p>  <p>Seth, the <i>Silksong </i>boss, appears in a hidden area in Grand Gate. Hopefully by this point in the game, you’ll be furiously attacking all walls you come across to discover secret areas. This particular one is found after a trip up an elevator shaft in Grand Gate, where you’ll find a smashable wall on the left at the top. You can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/131EHJhMV70">the boss battle with Seth here</a>.</p>   <p>Upon release of the game, <i>Hollow Knight</i> fans took to social media to mourn the loss of Seth while celebrating the game’s eventual release. “I wish so badly that we could play <i>Silksong</i> together,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1n5jysg/we_made_it_seth/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reads a post</a> from one user who considers Seth the reason they became a <i>Hollow Knight </i>fan, “but I’m glad you’ll still be there in some form.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/office-spin-off-first-look-the-paper-nbc-peacock-teaser-1851780331"><i><span>The Paper</span></i></a><span>, the new spin-off of </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> that’s streaming now on Peacock, will probably be pretty funny to the average viewer. To a journalist who has lived through everything the profession has suffered over the past 20 years or so, the workplace mockumentary is a cathartic encapsulation of so much of the nonsense I’ve never been able to explain to my friends and family who don’t work in the field. </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>’s 10-episode season portrays the trials and tribulations that come with working in journalism in 2025, whether that be on a local level like the volunteer reporters of the fictional </span><i><span>Toledo Truth Teller</span></i><span> or on a larger scale, and the show does it with a surprising level of care, sympathy, and advocacy for the important work people are trying to do in impossible circumstances that threaten to undermine them at every turn.</span></p> <p><span>Admittedly, I was pretty skeptical coming into </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, not because I didn’t love </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> or because I had my doubts about how it would handle its too-close-to-home subject matter, but because all the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-office-paper-trailer-peacock-release-date-oscar-2000616348"><span>early promo trailers</span></a><span> did nothing for me. They didn’t really have jokes and seemed to be largely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-paper-office-spin-off-clip-video-trailer-peacock-2000620768"><span>banking on nostalgia for the original series</span></a><span> to draw people in. If nothing else, that’s made the fact that </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span> is pretty great a pleasant surprise.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>picks up a few years after </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>. Dunder Mifflin, the paper supply company that the original series documented, has shut down, and the documentary filmmakers who followed its workplace antics are looking for a new subject. They end up in the office of the </span><i><span>Toledo Truth Teller</span></i><span>, a local newspaper that has been so underfunded that its output is primarily news pulled from </span><i><span>AP</span></i><span>, mind-numbing listicles, and clickbait non-stories. New editor-in-chief Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson) has left his cozy life in sales behind to try to revive the legacy paper, only to find that he’s dealing with every roadblock the modern journalist faces when trying to do the work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625767"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625767">© Peacock</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Truth Teller </span></i><span>has lost almost all of its institutional knowledge, has no real funding to build itself back up, and is under the ownership of a larger corporation that has nothing to do with journalism. In fact, its owners only stand to see their position jeopardized if the publication digs a little deeper into the company’s own business practices. Nevertheless, Sampson is determined to make it work and relies on a small team of incredibly green, volunteer reporters to get things moving. Gee, that sure sounds like every media company, big and small, right now, huh?</span></p> <p><span>I have worked in journalism both on a local level at my small-town Georgia newspaper and at sites read by millions like </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and watching </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>was like reliving 10 lives over the course of 10 episodes. The show succinctly sums up all the hurdles getting in the way of good journalism in 2025 in a way that would be kind of horrifying if it weren’t delivered in the hilarious deadpan so synonymous with </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>. Ned and his team face underfunding, corporate sabotage, and a need to also grind out stomach-turning churnalism to help keep the lights on. Trying to do reporting that is both helpful to the public and clears a baseline ethical threshold is a never-ending struggle when the odds are stacked against you. Nearly every episode of </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>touches on some very real challenges journalists are dealing with as they just try to do their jobs in the modern media landscape, and I was truly pleased with how true-to-life it felt, even when taking things to their most absurdist extreme.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>was always at its best when it exaggerated mundane office drama into its most comical, awkward, and uncomfortable end stages, but focusing on a sales team, especially one selling something as unremarkable as paper, gave it a universal appeal. The show is less about the specifics of the work than it is the ubiquitous experience of clocking in and trying to make the most of something dreadfully boring with a group of people you probably otherwise wouldn’t hang out with. </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, meanwhile, is so specific and real, I feel like it might double as a surprisingly educational tool for a general audience about the state of journalism right now, who come in with preconceived notions of how it all works.</span></p> <p><span>For example, there’s an episode in which Esmeralda, the previous interim EIC of the paper, tries to get the team to go down the road of doing advertorials to cover some lifestyle products she wants, and Ned intervenes and says the team will review these items instead of uncritically promoting them for the paper. Eventually, it becomes clear that these products all have some serious adverse effects, leading to the staff getting sick or injured, and Ned, in a head-on collision of journalistic principles and the fear of incoming deadlines, tries to test all of them himself at once, and that goes about as well as you’d expect. Rather than trying to completely recapture </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>’s magic by making Ned a carbon copy of Steve Carell’s Michael Scott, </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>finds its own way to the same hysterical conclusions, all in a way that feels very specific to the workplace it follows. </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>is actually pretty restrained in its ties to its predecessor when it could have cynically leaned into that connection in order to bait the college kids who marathon the older series between classes into watching it.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625763" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625763"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625763">© Peacock</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The strongest tie </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>has to </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>is in Oscar (Oscar Nunez), the sole returning character in the main cast, who certainly has his own stuff going on, but also sometimes just feels like he’s there to bring attention to the fact that this show is a spin-off of something else. Nunez has several scenes that feel tailor-made to remind people that Michael Scott is somewhere out there off-screen. Some of the callbacks are good, like the metanarrative of him not wanting to be filmed by the documentary crew following him around again, but then he directly quotes bits from </span><i><span>Office </span></i><span>episodes, and it loses me. We are all the products of the jobs and coworkers we once had, but I had multiple instances of being like, “Oh, right, this show might one day be some kind of bid for a shared universe of mockumentaries for Peacock to churn out, not unlike the gross churnalism Ned and his team try to avoid.” Perhaps I’m being cynical, but </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>stands so well on its own that I don’t feel like it needed the</span><i><span> Office</span></i><span> tie-in to prop it up.</span></p> <p><span>All that being said, I get why Peacock would want to go back to </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>.</span> <span>Its workplace documentary format is still really clever, and when I watched the original show back in the day, I was always fascinated by how it would present scenes that, as far as the characters involved were concerned, were clearly not supposed to be on camera. Some of the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N56tjXt6JoY&amp;pp=ygUTamltIHByb3Bvc2VzIHRvIHBhbQ%3D%3D"><span>most iconic scenes from the original series</span></a><span> were shot at a distance, with un-mic’d actors pantomiming a scene the viewer ostensibly wasn’t supposed to see, or they’re shot through the crack of a barely opened door like the crew is being nosey as shit for the plot. When </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GY-dj-YSPs"><span>blew the lid off this</span></a><span> and had a member of the documentary crew interfere with the action onscreen nine seasons in, it was met with a lot of blowback from longtime fans. </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>is already more overtly playing with the fourth wall, so maybe that will set viewer expectations appropriately, but even after 12 years, the format still works, and </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>is using it well without resorting to the same playbook.</span></p> <p><span>I’m glad I gave </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>a chance after my first impression of it left me cold. A workplace comedy about a fumbling newspaper could have made a lot of uninformed or irresponsible jokes about a profession that is historically misunderstood, both willfully and because misinformation spreads on the internet like wildfire. Instead, it has a surprising level of empathy for the plight of the modern reporter. You have corporate owners who know nothing about the job meddling in your affairs, commenters nipping at your heels, and you’re more often than not barely compensated or rewarded for your efforts. I haven’t set foot in a local paper’s newsroom in six years, but I still marveled at how clearly </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span> sees that a lot of corporate media’s biggest obstacles are the same ones small-town reporters are fighting against in towns you’ve never heard of but that are full of people who still read the print version of their local news. All of its raunchy humor, clever cinematography, and painstakingly awkward comedic set pieces of the kind you know and love from its predecessor funnel into a mockumentary that, at the end of the day, humanizes the people behind the bylines, and knows they’re at their best when they’re free to do the work they came here to do, without constant interference from the powers that be.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is done with its role in the Epic Google case, and Google won’t be happy with the result. On Friday, the court completely denied its petition to have its <em>Epic v. Google</em> case re-heard — and pressed play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">on a permanent injunction</a> that will force Google to begin cracking open its Android app store.</p><p>Unless or until the US Supreme Court decides to hear the case, Google will be forced to let developers bypass its Google Play Billing app store payment system, and let them link to outside app store downloads, within 30 days. And that’s just the start. Google will also be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">forced to carry rival app stores inside the Google Play Store and share its full catalog of apps</a> with those stores by summer 2026 unless the Supreme Court grants a stay.</p><p>Epic already won its case at the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">on July 31st,</a> when a three-judge panel decided not to overturn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">the unanimous jury verdict from 2023</a> that Google’s app store and payment systems had become illegal monopolies. But Google argued that the Supreme Court might see things differently, and asked for what’s called an “en banc” review where the whole Ninth Circuit weighs in.</p><p>But not a single additional Ninth Circuit judge wanted to re-hear the case, the court wrote on Friday, denying Google’s petition. And with that, the Ninth Circuit also restarted the clock on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">forcefully cracking open Android</a>, giving the company a new deadline of just 30 days to begin complying, and 10 months until Google must open up its app store to rivals. That’s up from 14 days and 8 months previously.</p><p>So, what must Google do by October? Here’s the TL;DR:</p><div><ul><li><span>Stop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let developers set their own prices</span></li><li><span>Stop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation</span></li><li><span>Work with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores in</span></li></ul></div><p>Don’t take my word for it; here’s the full text directly out of Judge Donato’s original permanent injunction for the parts that now have a 30-day deadline:</p><div><blockquote><p>4. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not share revenue generated by the Google Play Store with any person or entity that distributes Android apps, or has stated that it will launch or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store.</p><p>5. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer to launch an app first or exclusively in the Google Play Store.</p><p>6. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer not to launch on a third-party Android app distribution platform or store a version of an app that includes features not available in, or is otherwise different from, the version of the app offered on the Google Play Store.</p><p>7. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or carrier to preinstall the Google Play Store on any specific location on an Android device.</p><p>9. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not require the use of Google Play Billing in apps distributed on the Google Play Store, or prohibit the use of in-app payment methods other than Google Play Billing. Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability of a payment method other than Google Play Billing. Google may not require a developer to set a price based on whether Google Play Billing is used.</p><p>10. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability or pricing of an app outside the Google Play Store, and may not prohibit a developer from providing a link to download the app outside the Google Play Store.</p><p>13. Within thirty days of the date of this order, the parties will recommend to the Court a three-person Technical Committee. Epic and Google will each select one member of the Technical Committee, and those two members will select the third member. After appointment by the Court, the Technical Committee will review disputes or issues relating to the technology and processes required by the preceding provisions. If the Technical Committee cannot resolve a dispute or issue, a party may ask the Court for a resolution. The Technical Committee may not extend any deadline set in this order, but may recommend that the Court accept or deny a request to extend. Each party will bear the cost of compensating their respective party-designated committee member for their work on the committee. The third member’s fees will be paid by the parties in equal share.</p></blockquote></div><p>Google declined to answer whether it will comply with the court’s order by removing the requirement for Google Play Billing, allowing other payment methods, and letting developers link outside the Play Store by October, and working on the joint Technical Committee. Google spokesperson Dan Jackson only had this statement to offer:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>We are disappointed with the Ninth Circuit’s decision – the injunction will undermine the security and privacy of users, and we are reviewing our appeal options. Protecting users and the Android ecosystem remains our top priority.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>I also asked Epic about the committee, but haven’t heard back yet.</p><p>So far, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1966592849668915632">has tweeted:</a> “Now Google Play has 30 days to free ALL DEVELOPERS to offer competing payments in the USA — as Apple is required to do — free of scare screens, junk fees, and restrictions!” and “With super strong precedent in Epic v Apple, there’s no room for malicious compliance this time.” He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1967058096507039886">also suggested </a>that Epic doesn’t oppose <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765881/google-android-apps-side-loading-developer-verification">Google’s new Android developer verification requirements</a> in principle, but “we do oppose any use of such verification processes to block, stifle, or tax competing stores.”</p><p>Google has not yet said whether it will appeal to the Supreme Court, and we’ve asked about that as well. According to the Ninth Circuit, Google said that if it did appeal, it would do so within 45 days.</p><p>Here’s the Ninth Circuit’s latest decision:</p><p><em><strong>Update, September 15th: </strong>Added that Google declined to answer, and its statement.</em></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778332/google-epic-play-store-lawsuit-30-days-supreme-court#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/778332/google-epic-play-store-lawsuit-30-days-supreme-court]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158768/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> didn’t need to do much; it just needed to be 'more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>'. That’s a huge task in itself; a slightly bigger, slightly better version of an already amazing, genre-defining game. But it’s clear that, after seven years of refining and perfecting and toiling, Team Cherry wanted more than just 'more Hollow Knight'. Hours and hours of love have been poured into every single aspect of Silksong, where the attention to detail is off the charts, and the surprises just keep coming. It elevates map design and purposeful challenge effortlessly, and is an improvement on Hollow Knight in every single way.</p>
<p>I knew from the moment I first stepped into Pharloom and was wowed by its beautiful colour palette and its eclectic mix of bug NPCs, I would fall in love with this game. But the moment that truly cemented it for me was when I was struck with a revelation (very literally) by being hit by an enemy for <em>two</em> masks of damage instead of one. Barbs, spikes, and booby trap benches lay in waiting to catch me off guard. Sawblades and pits are <em>just</em> out of view to punish a dashing Hornet. One time, I stood on a switch that activated a blade that killed me in one hit after a tricky platforming challenge. I couldn’t stop laughing; I owe Primal Aspids an apology.</p>

<p>Pharloom hates you, and it hates Hornet, but I <em>adore</em> it. Its workers slave away until death and the coils of religion and silk are wrapped around many of the pilgrims wandering around the world. The golden and white faded halls of the Citadel are far from a safe haven for the people. The very harshness of Silksong is baked into every aspect, including the narrative, which enriches everything about the game for me. Sometimes, it’s relentless, but that’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>Eventually, every moment of frustration turned into elation as I mastered each environment and challenge put in front of me. Every time I opened up a new Bellway, I’d smile as the Bell Beast emerged and stomped her feet excitedly. Whenever I found a Flea and freed it from a cage or woke it up from a nap, I’d imitate its high-pitched bark. Pharloom is an oxymoron of a world, a twisted knot of beauty and terror with small pockets of joy and secrets to discover that it made me fall in love with failure.</p>
<p>And what a world to fail in, too. Pharloom is still a sombre world, but it's a rainbow compared to the muted tones of Hallownest. It also pops beautifully on Switch 2, particularly in handheld. It’s <em>also</em> perfect at 120fps. When I think of Silksong’s world, I think of the ornate converted bells made into homes and the thickets of leaves in the background of the swamps, all accompanied by Christopher Larkin’s incredible score. The poignant strings of Hunter’s March is one of my favourites, hinting at the kingdom of the ants’ fate from time’s past. Cogwork Core’s ticking and piano notes helped me time my platforming perfectly. Then there’s the incredibly fast-paced strings of Widow’s fight, a relentless onslaught of violins and cellos to match her snappy movement.</p>

<p>While failure is common, it’s alleviated by the fact that Hornet’s movement is sublime; she’s much faster than The Knight from the get-go, and that only grows the more skills she learns. Being able to dash <em>and</em> attack at the same time blows combat and platforming wide open, as does being able to heal in mid-air. You can see where Team Cherry has learned from some of Hollow Knight’s fiddly platforming and taken advantage of Hornet’s full range; climbing up a blizzard-ridden mountain or hopping over thorny pits feels seamless when you nail it.</p>
<p>Because of how fast Hornet moves, I didn’t really realise how big the map was until I reached Act 2 and pulled it up. It’s staggering to look at in comparison to Hollow Knight, and no room is purposeless or empty. Even if you find a dead-end, come back later and you’ll find a surprise or secret. NPCs who just seem like flavour text eventually become key figures. <em>Everything</em> matters in Silksong, and everything has a place.</p>
<p>It’s the same with combat, where Hornet has so many more options than The Knight. While Hornet has four different basic attacks, you can completely change these by equipping different Crests. I fell in love with the Reaper Crest, which changed Hornet’s idle slash into a wide-arcing, slightly slower needle swipe. But they all have their value; one late-game Crest turned Hornet’s running stab into a double-slash which shredded foes in my path, while another allowed me to drain enemy health and go into berserk mode whenever I used my silk to bind (aka, heal).</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158774/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The customisation is off the charts when you throw in Tools and Silk Skills, subweapons and magic-like attacks that allow Hornet to set traps or throw items from a distance or even parry and counter. Some Tools provide passive effects like adding poison to your damage or letting you grab onto walls without sliding down them; I tinkered around with these for boss fights and trials meticulously, as sometimes poison isn’t as effective or a boss could parry your own projectiles.</p>
<p>Silksong is tough, but really only in the sense that the skill floor is much higher than Hollow Knight’s was; once you learn to weave Tools, Skills, and movement into combat, victory tastes delicious in the way that I only really felt during Hollow Knight’s best fights. Most of those came from the DLC, which is where Silksong has plucked much of its boss philosophy from and refined.</p>
<p>At their best, bosses are a ballet of movement and action, where every action has a reaction and you move almost rhythmically. One secret boss in Act 2 has become one of my favourites of all time, a fast-paced brawl where you have to move constantly and always be on the offensive. By the time I beat the fight, I felt like I could read every single attack like the back of my hand, despite the fact that both of us were speeding around the arena like lightning bolts; I gripped the controller tightly, breathed in time with the rhythm of the fight, counted every single beat and hit before they happened. It was pure magic.</p>

<p>If I sound like I’m good at this game, I’m not. I died <em>a lot</em> and spewed many expletives as I tried again and again to master these dances. But the joy of a Metroidvania is that you can walk away and find something else to do to power yourself up. It’s the in-game equivalent of taking a breather, doing something a little less intense, grabbing a bit of extra money to buy a new Tool or discovering a new Crest that better suits your playstyle.</p>
<p>My only real gripe is with currency in the late-game. A patch has helped reduce the cost of some end-game stuff, but I always found myself a bit short of rosaries for Tools or upgrades and Shards to rebuild Tools. Nothing a few minutes of fast-paced pilgrim murdering didn’t solve, but a tiny bit more leniency wouldn’t go unappreciated.</p>
<p>But after spending over 60 hours with Silksong, it’s not the cruelty or the rare-stringent moment that sticks with me: it’s the triumph. It’s the blue lake hiding in the corner of a sewer system. It’s the hauntingly beautiful choral music echoing the Citadel’s chambers. It’s the friendships Hornet forged throughout the kingdom. It’s the tears I’ve shed after beating a particularly beautiful boss.</p>

<p>Silksong is a game that demands everything from you, but it returns just as much. The Last Judge is hard <em>because</em> it's the final guard before the Citadel. And, in return for finally overcoming it, you get so much more to explore, even better maps, and even better bosses. There are multiple paths you can take to certain quests that change the difficulty or reward you with different equipment. The way that areas blend together as you approach new biomes hints at what's to come.</p>
<p>Silksong's map tells a story of suffering and struggling that reinvigorates the way a Metroidvania map can be utilised. Obstacles exist for a reason, not just for some fun platforming, and it completely understands how to blend its <strong>Souls</strong> and Metroidvania inspirations and make everything purposeful.</p>
<p>I’ve fought some of the hardest bosses since <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/sekiro_shadows_die_twice">Sekiro</a> or <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_shadow_of_the_erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> and emerged triumphant. I’ve been at the very bottom, picked myself up, come back and sliced through challenges like butter over and over again. And yet, somehow, I <em>still</em> have more to uncover. But I’d gladly wipe my memory, go through the struggle, and perfect my techniques all over again.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s beauty is beguiling, hiding an interior that’s deliberately harsh but endlessly rewarding. Everything feels deliberate, pushing you to learn, improve, and perfect, or simply just explore a little more. And what a world it is to dig into.</p>
<p>Somehow, Team Cherry has surpassed my expectations tenfold and delivered a mesmeric blend of balletic combat and movement with persistence, joy, and an incredibly invigorating map at the centre. I’ve never felt better surmounting the challenges put in front of me, and I’m already raring to do it a second time.</p></section>

                <p>There have been some off-the-wall year collaborations in the past year, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">the Beavis and Butt-Head skins in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. However, developer Team Jade may have the wildest one of the year with the upcoming Delta Force x Saw crossover. In the teaser video, Saw's Jigsaw killer seemingly enters the world of this free-to-play first-person tactical shooter with a life or death ultimatum.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heyQ-uPTKyk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/heyQ-uPTKyk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the Saw films, the original Jigsaw killer, John Kramer, has been dead for almost two decades. And neither he nor his successors wore life-sized costumes based on Billy the Puppet. But the man behind Billy's mask in this clip certainly knows Kramer's modus operandi and his favorite catchphrases. It's only at the end of the video that he reveals himself as operator D-Wolf. This isn't the first time that Saw has crossed over into games, as Billy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-more-horror-legends-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526825/" data-ref-id="1100-6526825">appeared in Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-haunting-of-verdansk-zombies-jigsaw-night-map-more/1100-6483469/" data-ref-id="1100-6483469">Call of Duty</a>.</p><p>D-Wolf's Billy the Puppet skin will make its in-game debut on October 23--just in time for Halloween--alongside firearms and other items inspired by the Saw films. In the meantime, a new Delta Force season, War Ablaze, will begin on September 23. On that date, the game will introduce two new modes, Operation Warden and Operation Raven, as well as a new Warfare map called Fault. Additionally, a new operator, Raptor, will be added to the game's roster.</p><p>Last month, Delta Force reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/delta-force-surges-beyond-200000-concurrent-users-on-steam/1100-6534233/" data-ref-id="1100-6534233">a new peak of concurrent players on Steam</a> with 210,000. The game has steadily built up a following since its debut in December 2024. However, it appears that Delta Force is far more popular internationally than it is domestically, since it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxa6qdhp3k24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">doesn't regularly show up in Circana's US engagement reports</a>.</p><p>As for the Saw movies, a new collection of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saw-movie-series-amazon-exclusive-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-editions-2025/1100-6534076/" data-ref-id="1100-6534076">Saw 4K Steelbook Editions are available for preorder on Amazon</a>. Earlier this summer, Blumhouse picked up a controlling stake in the Saw franchise, which will bring the original director, James Wan, back in a creative role for the first time since Saw 3 in 2006.</p>

"It's a different kind of football game, yet it's intuitive, and the allure of improving your skill level is captivating," wrote critic Richard Wakeling.</p><p>If you're looking for more arcade sports games like Rematch, the fast-paced basketball video game NBA Bounce launches on consoles and PC on September 26.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawk-recreated-thug%E2%80%99s-classic-intro-and-got-fans-more-excited-for-a-remake.1298517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was just earlier this year that Activision published<em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</a></em>, a remastered collection of two of the best games in the skateboarding series. But now, after a fun video from Hawk himself, fans are once again begging for a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake to join the series’ slate of recent re-releases.</p> <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/e">Tony Hawk posted a short video on his personal Instagram page</a>. In it, the skateboarding legend re-created the intro cutscene found in the original PS2-era <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground.</em> Here’s the short video:</p> <blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg329HAQcP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14">  </blockquote>  <p>In the video, Hawk can be seen taking on the role of the player-created character, even wearing a similar outfit to the one sported by the default character. Using some nice editing, Hawk interacts with the game’s popular villain, <a href="https://kotaku.com/eric-sparrow-thps-3-4-thug-underground-remake-cameo-ps5-1851784341">Eric Sparrow</a>, even calling him a bully at one point. At the very end, Hawk leaves and jokes, “Whoa! I can get off my board?!”, a reference to the fact that in <em>THUG</em> players could, for the first time in franchise history, hop off their skateboards and walk around levels.</p>

 <p>But before you get too excited and assume Tony Hawk is teasing some future <em>Underground</em> remake ala <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232"><em>THPS 3+4,</em></a> calm down. The video is marked as “Not a <em>THUG</em> promo.” Hawk also claims that the reason he created this short bit of nostalgia bait is to have some fun and celebrate Video Games Day.</p> <p>“In hopes of bringing some joy to your timeline: Happy Video Games Day from E.S. and me,” posted Hawk on Instagram.</p> <p>And like, yeah, I get that he’s trying to make it clear this isn’t a teaser, but of course, the internet is going to internet. Many are already assuming or hoping that this Instagram post is actually the first bit of marketing for a full-on <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake. And while I do think a <em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em> remake is coming one day, I do believe Hawk here, and this is just him having fun with fans. <a href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-underground-thug-remake-remaster-activision-1851780287">The famous skater has said in the past that he would love a <em>THUG</em> remake</a>, but made it clear that he doesn’t get to make that call. It’s all up to Activision, and considering the five-year gap between <em>THPS 1+2</em> and<em> THPS 3+4</em>, I’d suggest fans go play <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/thug-pro"><em>THUGPro</em></a> or something else while they wait for a <em>THUG</em> remake, because it’s likely many years away.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death to Death Runs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-to-death-runs.1298499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, the always tiresome debate over difficulty in games has risen again to fuel our never-ending need for discourse. Obviously, that has compelled me to join the fray on the side that death runs are lame and suck and they should die.</p>

<h2>Do I Need to Git Gud?</h2>

<p>I know the response, just git gud, right?</p>

<p>Before I address my ability to git gud, let’s define a death run. Simply, you respawn after you die, and it's the path you have to take to get back to where you died. Sometimes it’s close to where you failed, other times it is not. It’s the other times I have a problem with.</p>

<p>As fun as it may be to throw a classic “git gud” in someone’s face, it’s not really a criticism that works when it comes to death runs. The problem isn't a lack of skill, it's the fact that doing the same piece of content over and over is tedious and boring.</p>



<p>Some may argue that death runs are part of the complete package of something like getting back to a boss. That the obstacles put in your way, the challenges like the platforming or what have you, are all part of the experience.</p>

<p>Think of them like a little “level” of the game where you must reach the end to fight the boss -- classic game design.</p>

<p>Maybe the first time going through the obstacle course that is a death run is really cool and fun, so the whole package does make sense. It's something you really enjoy. Will you enjoy it 5 times from now? 10? In reality, quite a bit more than that?</p>

<p>If doing the same thing over and over is fun for you, more power to you. For a lot of people, myself included, it’s tedium at best.</p>



<p>Especially when the point of so many games that employ death runs, like soulslikes, is overcoming a challenge and besting something difficult – the satisfaction of finally winning.</p>

<p>So, why in the hell would I want to do the same piece of content over and over again that I have already bested?</p>

<h2>Origins of Death Runs</h2>

<p>Naturally, I found myself asking just what is the point of the death runs? Where did they come from and why have they stuck around?</p>

<p>Old-school games are well-known for their difficulty, and they were notorious for having you play the same level or part of a level over and over again. There’s a few reasons for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some reasons were physical in that cartridges didn't have a ton of memory, so some games had to be smaller, meaning making them more difficult lengthened their playtime. The influence of arcade games can't be overlooked either, where game design was incentivized to up the difficulty so players would fail and be forced to shell out more quarters to keep going.</p>

<p>Then there are the technical limitations like a lack of saving or checkpoints, so each level had to be self-contained and completed in one successful run.</p>



<p>There are certainly more reasons why games were hard and repetitive, but the majority were not made that way with the idea of making the game more fun or enjoyable. Technical limitations and things like incentives to eat up more quarters were more at the forefront than anything else.</p>

<p>At best, old-school games and gamers were just used to the idea that trial and error, throwing yourself at something over and over, was just how you played games. Things like tutorials, saves, and other conveniences we take for granted now just weren’t around.</p>

<p>Now that we no longer have those limitations, I don’t quite see the allure of making players do the same thing over and over again.</p>

<h2>Are Death Runs Good Game Design?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Even if we accept the idea that doing a death run on the way to a boss over and over is a good one, the design goals seem to be in conflict with one another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want players to fight the boss, right? So, do we make the death run back just as challenging as the normal part of the game? If we don't, doesn't that conflict with the general design elsewhere in the game? If we do, is it maybe unfair or too challenging knowing there's a boss fight waiting at the end?</p>

<p>Also, does it make sense to make players redo content over and over as a sort of "gate" before a boss? Why do we want to make it a chore to get back to the most exciting parts of our game?</p>



<p>Some games seem to ask those questions above during level design, while other's don't consider the run back or where you respawn much at all. That means players are sometimes running through already-played, difficult sections to get back to where they died. Early <em>Souls </em>games are notorious for that in particular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what do the vast majority of players do with games like that? Run and dodge like hell to avoid any and all enemies on the way back to the boss, praying they don’t get swiped along the way. Thinking of it another way, they aren’t engaging with the designed elements of the game at all, and they’re really only hoping to not be penalized as they run back – no real pay off, just a downside. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Presenting those two ideas -- something easier and therefore less engaging, and something players don’t engage with at all -- can feel disingenuous, but there’s really no middle ground with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, I suppose there’s the third option that makes you do the insane obstacle course or enemy gauntlet prior to a boss every time, which, well, there you really have no option but to git gud I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think a good majority fall into those first two categories, though. So it really begs the question, why do we have them at all then?</p>



<p>Other than to pad some time, what is the reason? I mean, even the kings of this sort of game FromSoftware realized death runs kind of suck when they added the Stakes of Marika in<em> Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At best, death runs are a flawed, incomplete experience of game design that get repetitive. At worst, they are repetitive obstacles in your way that players feel aren't worth engaging with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Death Runs and Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A final thing I want to address is a common retort I see online that something like a death run helps immersion or contextualize where you are in a game. I can’t seriously entertain that idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is one arbitrary point of respawn somehow more immersive than somewhere else? Why is having to run through a part of a game again, likely many times, more immersive?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silksong-bench.jpg?itok=TFqS6N2I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silksong-bench.jpg?itok=e3n-QaTf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The immersion of this bench is that it is cruel and hurtful.</figcaption></figure><p>The answer is it just isn’t. It’s an arbitrary position tied to some sort of save or checkpoint, that’s all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no context gained by seeing the part of a level that leads up to the boss again. You’ve already seen it, and it’s not like dying to a boss wipes your memories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anything, having to start over far away breaks immersion more, taking you out of the area you just were. Is it not more immersive to remain immersed in that same area, continue the fight?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I don’t need an arbitrary death run to serve as a “breather” to take a beat before I try a boss fight again. Believe it or not, I'm capable of just waiting and doing that all by myself.</p>

<h2>So Yeah, Death to Death Runs</h2>

<p>From all I can see, death runs are arbitrary and don’t serve much of a purpose than to pad some time. Even the well-intentioned design decisions to have them are flawed at best.</p>

<p>Here I focused on games designed around things like a unique challenge or boss fight as the exciting moment the game builds you up to. There may be some worthwhile discussion on games where they are more level-based, run-based in design.</p>

<p>But that’s a discussion for a different day.</p>

<p>So, death runs, please go away. They waste my time and keep me from engaging with the best parts of a game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for its open-world MMO racing game, The Crew, on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/purchases-and-rewards/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-legacy-ubisoft-games-n-to-z/000105855">March 31, 2024</a>. It was unfortunate news, but not particularly surprising in today's modern age of online games having an expiration date of 'whenever the developer decides it can't/won't pay for the servers anymore.' But while the occurrence of online games being shuttered is now commonplace, The Crew's shutdown sparked something more.</p>



<p>It not only sparked a lawsuit that made players more aware than ever that they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">always been buying a license to play a game</a>, instead of a copy of a game. It sparked enough backlash that Ubisoft committed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a>. It caused enough uproar that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">Valve added a warning to Steam purchases</a>, making it clear to players they're buying a license to play a game, instead of a copy of the game. And, perhaps most significantly, it was the match that lit the flame under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">Stop Killing Games Initiative</a>.</p>



<p>While the Stop Killing Games and the Stop Destroying Videogames initiatives and petitions continue, and the lawsuit two Californian The Crew fans began is still underway, a group called <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">The Crew Unlimited (TCU)</a> has been working hard to bring The Crew back the old-fashioned way, by creating an emulator to run the servers on.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/news/?post=news-tcu-release">TCU realized its goal</a>, and players with a copy of the game can jump back into The Crew thanks to their hard work.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IT'S BACK! Playing The Crew 1 in 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqbKAMq029A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you own a copy of The Crew on PC, then you should be able to set TCU up for yourself to continue playing a game that's shutdown seems to have had more of an impact on the videogame industry than it did when it was still being distributed by Ubisoft.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We’re all familiar with the trolley problem. We’re all so familiar with it that we’re also familiar with all the spoofs of the trolley problem that have sprung up in recent years. But I’m pleased to say I’ve found a fresh take on the entire scenario: even sillier (if smarter) spoofs of the trolley problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/"><em>The Trolley Solution</em></a> brings the classic black-and-white sketches to life in a series of video game vignettes, beginning with the classic question, but quickly descending into fantastically funny nonsense, including some completely splendid mini-games, one of which is a visual novel love story.</p> <p>You know how the trolley problem goes:</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is rapidly approaching five people tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley onto a different track.</p> <p>This action would save the five people, but it would kill someone else.</p> <p>What would you do?”</p></blockquote> <p>But in&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em>, the classic philosophical dilemma and many absurd riffs on it are brought to life in 3D, bringing a whole new level of reality to the hypothetical problem when the crudely animated people splatter into little blobs. What if, for instance, rerouting the trolley would knock a dog’s bone away? Can you really make the choice if it means watching the little doggy look into his empty bowl, his tail down, his head despondently hung? Other new variants it introduces on the classic dilemma are more elaborate and wonderfully original, unlike anything I’ve seen in those overly long Reddit threads where people with undue confidence misattribute philosophical doctrine. For instance,</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is quickly approaching your girlfriend, who is tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley to a different track, but on that track is your best friend, also tied up.</p> <p>However, you discover that your girlfriend has been cheating on you with your best friend.</p> <p>But your best friend didn’t know she was your girlfriend.</p> <p>To complicate things, your best friend is terminally ill and will die of cancer in a month.</p> <p>What will you do?”</p></blockquote>  <p>Honestly, I’m simple enough that I’d have been charmed just by a series of increasingly daft scenarios like these, especially since you get to see each play out, choosing whether to pull the lever or not. But&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is much more ambitious in its daftness. Levels constantly introduce one-off mechanics, at one point seeing the game turn into a perfect spoof of the billions of monochrome “hidden object” games that appeared in the wake of the fantastic&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hidden-object-puzzle-game-hidden-folks-is-getting-free-1843541062"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a>, here with an entire trolley “hiding” in enormous, screens-wide illustrations packed with visual gags. I scarequote “hiding” given it’s a trolley, and even glasses and a <em>Where’s Waldo</em> hat can’t quite do it. Bless it, it’s trying. (The <em>Where’s Trolley</em> joke works much better in the UK where the books are called <em>Where’s Wally?</em>)</p>

 <p>At another point it becomes a third-person racing game, as you jump between tracks to gather coins and avoid oncoming trolleys. And yes, in one extended and completely brilliant sequence, the game becomes a lampooning visual novel, in which you play a young Japanese girl who, on her way to school, falls in love with a trolley. It has many different endings, one of which describes the situation where the girl and the trolley rush too quickly into an overly committed romance, later realizing the foundations for a lasting relationship had never been established, the two growing to loathe one another, before finally, acrimoniously, breaking up. Another, naturally, results in people getting run over by a trolley. It’s all very romantic. It contains dialogue like,</p> <blockquote><p>“Tameko tells Tomodachi all about her dream. As she talks a weird gut feeling makes her uneasy. She explains the nuances of picking between Deontology and Utilitarianism. It feels like there is something more to it, like a prophecy in the making…”</p></blockquote> <p>As much as I want to blurt out every single surprise game mode that appears, l obviously won’t, but I do have to share one more: There’s an entire Tamagotchi sim in there, in which—yes of course—you must feed, clean, and play with a young trolley until it grows into a happy and profitable adult. “Can you take care of it until it gains monetary and moral stability?” asks the game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625734"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625734">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth saying&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is not taking anything seriously, and you’re going to see a lot of people get squished in front of trolleys. Because the game’s black and white, and because the human characters are like even simpler <em>Human Fall Flat</em> figures, obviously it’s nothing outlandish, but people sure do go splat when they’re run over. And you will want to note that it does include a moment with someone jumping in front of a trolley. When that happened I shouted, “GOD DAMN IT!” and laughed very hard, because it really wasn’t OK in the best way.</p> <p>I swear, for all the stuff I’ve mentioned, there are so many more surprises in here. There are whole other short games, spoofs of well-known genres I’m dying to tell you about, and while a few of these are perhaps a little over-long (something done five times can be a lot more fun than something done ten times), they’re all so well-realized and funny. There’s a total of 40 levels, each containing its own unique trolley problem situation, and precisely none of them take the conceit seriously. Thank goodness.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625735"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625735">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I love stumbling on a game like this. I installed it simply because I liked the cartoon art, having no idea where it was heading. It turns out it was heading all over the place, with a wicked sense of humor, and the chops to pull off half a dozen genre spoofs along the way. (And don’t worry if you see the DLC on the Steam store—as much as you can absolutely buy it (and the developer deserves it!), it’s part of a gag.)</p> <p>What a joyfully silly thing to exist. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">You should go buy it right now, it’s only $6.50</a>.</p>
