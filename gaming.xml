              <p>Less than two years after it debuted, Amazon’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2s-first-real-trailer-is-here-and-its-bonkers-2000644032"><em>Fallout</em> TV show</a> is back with season 2, and even earlier than originally promised. New episodes will now kick off a whole 24 hours earlier than previously planned. The company used the Las Vegas sphere to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSShMHRkmpY/">reveal the reverse-delay</a>.</p> <p>Originally set to launch on December 17, 2025, <em>Fallout</em> season 2 will now begin streaming on December 16 at 9:00 p.m. ET instead. New episodes will be released weekly, with the latest batch wrapping up on February 4, 2026. Walton Goggins’ Ghoul, Ella Purnell’s vault dweller, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Aaron Moten will return as the show moves the focus to New Vegas, the subject of the critically acclaimed video game spin-off by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>   <p>Season 2 adds Macaulay Culkin in an unknown role and Justin Theroux as Mr. House, the guy in charge of New Vegas. It’s unclear exactly how Lucy and the Ghoul’s roundtrip through the desert will unfold, but the show has already <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-season-2-tv-show-new-vegas-location-deathclaw/">teased Deathclaws</a> and other big monsters making brief cameos. Will we see some Super Mutants too?</p> <p>The show seems likely to wade even more deeply into wasteland conspiracies and factional disputes, but none of it will be resolved in the eight upcoming episodes. Amazon has already renewed <em>Fallout</em> for season 3, and probably will make as many more as showrunner Jonathan Nolan is able to give them. Remember, <em>Fallout</em> isn’t on Netflix or HBO. You’ll need a Prime subscription to watch. Or the password to your friend’s account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Truth be told, I haven't played all that many games this year, who has the time! There was one I couldn't miss out on, however, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, the first properly new entry in the series for many years, and one with some pedigree behind it, Higurashi and Umineko writer Ryukishi07. I ended up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">reviewing it</a> for this here site, and liked it very much then, and perhaps more now. There were some great lessons to be learned, and in a recent interview, Ryukishi07 put some of those lessons into succinct, quite lovely words.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-f-writer-knows-you-dont-really-want-to-see-a-happily-ever-after-and-the-games-horrific-portrayal-of-young-womanhood-makes-it-my-goty/">GamesRadar</a>, the writer spoke of how each of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's characters, not just protagonist Hinako, but her parents, her friends, and the mysterious Fox Mask "may have had their own hell. Please do not forget that, or the fact that Hinako was oblivious to those hells, as she was too consumed by her own personal hell to notice." He continued to note how your own personal hell is "a world of solitude that no one else can perceive, but please do not fall into the trap of assuming that others around you have no hell of their own."
</p>
<p>
It's later on in the interview where Ryukishi07 says what I find most heartwarming, a strange feeling to have with something like Silent Hill. He discusses how he wants people to believe that whatever form of hell a person might be experiencing, it will come to an end one day. And according to him, "the key to the way out of your personal hell lies in the hands of your family, friends, or your local hotlines. You have endured through your personal hell so much. You have already persevered enough, so please, be proud of yourself, and rely on the help of others."
</p>
<p>
The hotlines part is possibly a touch hokey, but the overall spirit of the message is one I appreciate deeply. It is a message that is well woven into the game itself, and is borderline Kingdom Heartsian in its nature, a series that is perhaps diametrically opposed to Silent Hill in almost every regard. The feeling of comradery between Hinako and Shu is one of the best elements of the game, and it's reassuring to see the powerful narrative of the two relying on one another wasn't just a fluke.
</p><p>
I'd really recommend the full reader over at GamesRadar, as long as you're alright with some spoilers. I had little faith in Silent Hill f, and was proven wrong, so to see the love with which Ryukishi07 speaks of his creation is just nice to see.

On Steam, the game reached a peak over the weekend of 56,993 players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to SteamDB</a>. The numbers haven't been that high since June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's popularity is reflecting in sales, as well. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3ma23xntiwk2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Rhys Elliott</a>, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, sales of Clair Obscur have spiked since The Game Awards. They're up 76% on Steam, 21% on PS5, and 3% on Xbox (where it's available on Game Pass). Alinea's estimate is that this amounts to over 200,000 more copies sold in just a few days.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/bafkreig3wwiueo7cpgfejnsw5o3sdym5rqer4tcx7j6wddi4kdn7hyvsey-1765831179743.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But returning players are also coming back. Mat Piscatella, senior director at Circana, said that "the percent of US active PS, XBX and US Steam players engaging with the game more than tripled by Dec 13th when compared to Dec 10th. US Steam showed the largest lift," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zxuzbclk2f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a Bluesky post</a>. Piscatella affirmed that this was the highest total of players engaged on Steam since June 1, with Xbox in the US seeing its highest total since June 27, and PlayStation in the US since June 10th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an incredible spike no matter how you look at it, reflecting both those playing for the first time as well as returning players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-dlc-is-out-now-the-game-awards">giving the free DLC</a> a shot. It's likely that its run of awards had something to do with this, especially since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">one of those awards was Game of the Year</a>. It's gained so much attention that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-emmanuel-macron-is-back-on-instagram-celebrating-clair-obscur-expedition-33-this-time-for-winning-game-of-the-year">even French president Emmanuel Macron</a> spoke up to congratulate developer Sandfall Interactive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like all these other people, are just starting Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 this weekend, here at IGN we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-starter-guide-beginner-tips">helpful Beginner Guide</a> that you may find useful to read through as you start.

                <p>Paladin is finally playable in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, and after a weekend with the ARPG's newest class, it's clear the holy-magic wielding warrior is a force to be reckoned with and more than just a copycat of its Diablo 2 counterpart, even if I personally wished it leaned into its namesake a little more.</p><p dir="ltr">After two and a half years of waiting, Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-play-diablo-4s-new-paladin-class-right-now/1100-6536915/" data-ref-id="1100-6536915">shadowdropped Paladin for Diablo 4</a> during a reveal for the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred expansion</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>. Preordering the expansion grants early access to the Paladin, with the full expansion also set to add a second, still unannounced class.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpaz0etTqJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gpaz0etTqJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's Paladin is a fascinating mix of old and new. While the class bears the Paladin name from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a>, it arguably shares just as much, if not more, in common with the Crusader from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, with a number of similar abilities and over-the-top holy magic. Taken all together, the Diablo 4 Paladin is a new concotion combining two different flavors of light-slinging, with a splash of originality tossed in for good measusre.</p><p dir="ltr">Though I would have loved it if the class embraced its Diablo 2 inspirations a bit more, but there is still plenty here to enjoy for old-school Paladin fans. You can, of course, make a Hammerdin, warping around the battlefield and wiping out packs of demons with dozens of swirling hammers. Zeal is back as well, as are powerful auras, a defining feature of the class from Diablo 2. There are four main ways to build the Paladin in Diablo 4, each represented by the class's unique Oaths mechanic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The Zealot Oath focuses on unrelenting offense based around the iconic Zeal ability from Diablo 2, encouraging players to stack attack speed and crit chance.</li><li dir="ltr">For those looking to stand their ground and become a fortress unto themselves, the Juggernaut Oath allows for a tank playstyle that focuses on shield-based abilities and overwhelming defense.</li><li dir="ltr">The flashiest of the bunch, the Judicator Oath revolves around huge area-of-effect holy damage, applying Judgement to enemies and detonating those marks to huge effect.</li><li dir="ltr">Last but not least, the Disciple Oath sees players temporarily transform into an angelic Arbiter, granting special buffs and dealing damage to nearby enemies. Those who choose this oath will seek to stay in Arbiter form for as long as possible to take advantage of its various buffs and enhanced mobility.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">I'm sure there will be creative builds that combine a number of different skills and philosophies that don't strictly fit into one of the four playstyles above, but that's a general overview of the class. Like I said before, I wished the Paladin had a little more Diablo 2-flavor. Many of its abilities, particularly its various shield-based abilities like Shield Charge, Blessed Shield, Shield Bash, as well as skills like Condemn and Consecration, are all straight from Crusader.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Diablo 4's Paladin feels like two classes in one. For those who wish to relive the days of Diablo 2, the Zealot Oath and abilities like Fanaticism Aura and Zeal feel like the most direct throughline between the two games. The Judicator playstyle also brings in some Diablo 2 flavor with Blessed Hammers and its Holy Light aura (which can be converted into fire damage with a new Unique item, essentially turning it into Diablo 2's Holy Fire aura).</p><p dir="ltr">The other two Oath playstyles, however, are more Crusader-coded. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as Crusader itself shares a significant amount of Paladin DNA. In Diablo 4, the shield-focused Juggernaut Oath, as well as some of the class' more over-the-top holy abilities, feel the most like Crusader.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnvWkUIA8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IfnvWkUIA8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Disciple skills are in some ways the odd-ones-out. While some Disciple skills are taken directly from Diablo 3, like Condemn and Falling Star (very similar to the Crusader's Falling Sword), the class' Arbiter transformation is functionally fairly different from its closest Crusader comparison, Akarat's Champion. Of the four playstyles, the Disciple Oath is the one that feels the most original to this particular version of sword-and-board-wielding holy knight, even if it does feature a number of abilities directly inspired by Crusader.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of which playstyle you go with, you can rest assured that Diablo 4's Paladin does kick some serious ass. Its synergies are easy to understand and take advantage of, and that more straightforward nature (especially compared to the more complicated previous new class, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/" data-ref-id="1100-6525108">Spiritborn</a>) makes Paladin a great class for those diving into Diablo 4 for the first time or returning after a long hiatus. Every ability looks and feels powerful, and Blizzard has done a fantastic job delivering on that holy-knight-in-shining-armor fantasy that was so desperately missing from Diablo 4 up until this point.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's second expansion, Lord of Hatred, releases April 28. We recently sat down with Blizzard to learn more about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-brings-back-everyones-favorite-hot-mom-amazons-and-lorath/1100-6536976/" data-ref-id="1100-6536976">how Lord of Hatred will bring back fan-favorite characters</a> like Lorath and everyone's favorite "hot mom"(aka Lilith), as well as what players can expect from the expansion's new region of Skovos. Lord of Hatred will be the first time a Diablo game has ever received two expansions, and Blizzard looks to be celebrating with a second, still-to-be-revealed class. Alongside new classes, the expansion will rework skill trees for all of the game's classes, introduce a loot filter, overhaul its endgame, and bring back the franchise's iconic Horadric Cube.</p>

If you prefer physical media, the PS5 is the way to go, as it’s ultimately more affordable than the combined price of a PS5 Digital Edition and Sony’s external drive.</p><p>If you want a little more oomph, you can also save on the more powerful <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> through December 25th, which is currently matching its all-time low of around $649 ($101 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5nbBL/%5Bp_id:1011l394533%5D/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-consoles%2Fplaystation5-pro-console" rel="sponsored">PlayStation Direct</a>. The PS5 Pro features a bigger GPU, faster memory, improved ray tracing, Wi-Fi 7 support, and AI-based upscaling. The upgraded internals let you play “PS5 Pro Enhanced” titles at higher resolutions or frame rates than on a standard PS5; however, there are no PS5 Pro-exclusive games. While we did notice some slight graphical improvements when playing games on the more powerful console, the differences were only apparent when sitting closer than 10 feet away from the TV.</p><p>The <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong> is currently down to its all-time low of $178.99 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-Portal-Remote-Player-for-PS5-Console%2F5060699568" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-playstation-portal-remote-player-midnight-black%2FJXHQ3C2H3K%2Fsku%2F6614840" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> through December 25th. When the handheld remote player originally launched in 2023, its sole function was to remotely stream games from the PS5 via Wi-Fi. The Portal has improved since then, with Sony introducing a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814078/playstation-portal-ps5-cloud-streaming">cloud streaming feature</a> that allows PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PS5 games, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a>, directly from the cloud instead of from their console over Wi-Fi. Portal users can also stream select titles from their own library without needing to connect to their PS5 console at all, making the 8-inch device a little more versatile than it was at launch.</p><p>Now through December 19th, you can snag Sony’s <strong>DualSense Wireless Controller</strong> in select colors starting at $54 (about $21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FY6Y9WZT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-Cosmic-Red%2F18264102609" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-playstation-5-dualsense-wireless-controller-midnight-black%2FJXHQ37T9XC" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The PS5 gamepad helps enhance the gaming experience with haptic vibrations and rear triggers with variable tension. The wireless controller also features a built-in speaker, gyroscope, accelerometer, and a touchpad, and it’s compatible with both macOS and Windows if you like to game on other platforms. Whereas the PS5 and Portal may not arrive in time for Christmas, Amazon says the DualSense will be ready to unwrap on the big day.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</strong> have returned to around $169 ($31 off), their best price to date, at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSQSX7FB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-PULSE-Explore-Wireless-Earbuds-with-Charging-Case-for-PS5-White%2F5113283042" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-pulse-explore-wireless-gaming-earbuds-for-ps5-white%2FJXHQ3CCYGQ%2Fsku%2F6566053" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The wireless earbuds are tailor-made for Sony’s consoles, allowing you to take advantage of lossless, ultra-low-latency audio when using the PlayStation Link protocol. In our testing, the <a href="https://bloomaudio.com/blogs/articles/whats-the-difference-between-dynamic-and-planar-magnetic-drivers">planar magnetic drivers</a> delivered an audio experience that offered great clarity and separation, making it easy to distinguish small details and individual sound effects. When you’re done gaming with them, you can even pair the Pulse Explore to your phone and other Bluetooth devices, making it easy to use them as plain ol’ earbuds.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/844698/sony-ps5-playstation-portal-dualsense-controller-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Last month saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk">the release of Project Misriah</a>, an ambitious modding project that tried to re-create the feel of <em>Halo 3</em> inside Valve’s <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>. That project has now been taken down from the Steam Workshop, though, after drawing a <span id="_b3hAae3XHNOj0PEPoYS8uA4_97">Digital Millennium Copyright Act </span>complaint from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Modder Froddoyo <a href="https://x.com/Froddoyo/status/1990243094311424022">introduced Project Misriah on November 16</a> as “a workshop collection of <em>Halo</em> ported maps and assets that aims to bring a <em>Halo 3</em> multiplayer-like experience to <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>.” Far from just being inspired by <em>Halo 3</em>, the mod directly copied multiple sound effects, character models, maps, and even movement mechanics from Bungie and Microsoft’s popular series.</p>
<p>In the weeks since, Project Misriah has drawn a lot of praise from both <em>Halo</em> fans and those impressed by what modders could pull off with the Source 2 engine. But last Wednesday, modder Froddoyo <a href="https://x.com/Froddoyo/status/1998833996395053070">shared a DMCA request from Microsoft</a> citing the “unauthorized use of <em>Halo</em> game content in a [Steam] workshop not associated with <em>Halo</em> games.”</p>

<p>In a social media post sharing that DMCA text, Froddoyo ruefully said that players should “make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft” for the project’s fate. But in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk&amp;lc=UgyYC9fQkPIh-iWt6454AaABAg">a comment on Project Misriah’s YouTube trailer</a>, Froddoyo noted that, following the takedown, the project “will not be worked on or uploaded in the future. But hey, it was fun while it lasted. Thank you to all of the players and supporters of [the] project. We will use the knowledge and skills obtained from this to cook up something else!”</p>

                <p>After two and a half years, eleven seasons, and one massive, game-changing expansion, Diablo 4's Age of Hatred is finally coming to a close. Announced as part of 2025's The Game Awards, Diablo 4's next expansion, Lord of Hatred, marks the end of the game's ongoing saga--one which has seen Lilith, Inarius, Mephisto, and the humans of Sanctuary engage in an epic struggle to gain control of the world and its future. But while the upcoming expansion promises a "satisfying" conclusion and an "epic, final showdown" with the game's big bad, Mephisto, it also promises a number of other exciting features, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Prior to the expansion's announcement, GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer were invited to attend an exclusive interview with two key members of Lord of Hatred's narrative team: lead narrative designer Matt Burns and narrative designer Eleni Rivera. The pair were eager to answer our questions about Lord of Hatred, even those that were, admittedly, both thirsty and bizarre. We left the Q&amp;A session with a better understanding of Mephisto's plans, the lore behind the revamped Paladin class, and the Skovos Isles, as well as a great deal of anticipation--anticipation for more personality-filled dialogue options, plenty of "Jedi mind tricks," and the return of Amazons, Lilith, and Ralph Ineson's velvety voice.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: Vessel of Hatred felt like you guys were holding your breath. Was that a Band-Aid or a part of the story that you always wanted to tell? I'm sure you guys heard a little bit of the feedback that Vessel of Hatred was good and also felt like it was teasing out of the showdown that we were all really waiting for. I'm wondering how much of that was planned versus you guys just taking longer to produce this big showdown.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> It's always been our intention. This is an "Age of Hatred" or Mephisto-Lilith-themed saga. Even before the base game came out--once we had finished our work on it, but before the actual release date--we were already planning out the next chapters of the story and it was always going to be about the story about Mephisto, his plans for Sanctuary, and ultimately all culminating to a final confrontation with him.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>When it comes to story, there's always things that change and it's trying to figure out what can we keep, what gets lost, and what is the streamline--especially when it comes to telling this really fun, big story. With Vessel of Hatred, we wanted to really dig into Mephisto and his motivation and keep that with Neyrelle. Now we get a chance to end it. I think it's sticking to our themes about family; that's a really big theme that we have with Mephisto and Lilith, and her children and Inarius. I think that it's finally all coming together. And that was always the plan--to have this big story that feels well-thought-out, and characters that you love and you want to fight for and want to fight against.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: And is this the final showdown?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> Yeah, this is a final showdown. We're going to see Mephisto in his full prime evil demonic glory. It's like what Eleni was talking about a little earlier: When you look at the bigger picture, you're seeing these phases of Mephisto, right? In the base game, he's very on the edges. He's not reborn yet and he's taking on the wolf form. In Vessel, he's a little more powerful because now he's in this Soulstone and he's able to do more. And so in Lord of Hatred, it's like there are no more chains on him. And although he's assuming--at first, at least--this form of Akarat, this prophet figure, he likes to manipulate people and do those sorts of things. He's using a new tool now to do that, but ultimately, the story culminates in us facing him, taking off his mask, and really just having this big epic showdown with him.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>It'll be very satisfying, I think, for the players with a lot of the story. There will be satisfaction along with horrors, and I think that's the best thing for Diablo. You've got some crazy, horrific things, and then you get this nice finale.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the Paladin and how they differ from previous games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> There've been Paladins in Diablo before as well as the Crusader, who's similar to a Paladin in many ways because they're using the light as their source of magic. The Diablo 4 Paladin is a little bit different in terms of the lore and story. Rather than coming from the Zakarum church or being part of this big religion or institution, they're of a smaller order who are independent. And they're just out in the world trying to do good. They've learned from the past that being part of these big institutions inevitably leads to corruption, so they've purposefully, intentionally gone out and said, "We're not going to get involved in that kind of stuff. We're just going to find the light within us and use that to do good out in the world." And so they have these oaths that they live by so that they don't follow the corruption and that sort of thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Eleni Rivera: </strong>The fun part is that we get to reinvent the Paladin. While they recognize the past, they know about the Zakarum, they know about other Paladins that have existed… They get to redefine who they are, what they are, and what The Order is. <em>That's</em> who they are. They even choose a new name when they join The Order, and their name is directly connected to what they find the most important within it. It's so cool. You get a chance to see this new form of who they are.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>And what's interesting about them too is they--due to their close connection with the light--are also aware of angels and the heavens. They know that angels are beings of light. And so they don't worship angels or anything like that, but they see them as these embodiments of light and embodiments of values that are associated with the light, like valor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623175-4621567-diablo4paladinplayablenow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623175" data-ratio="0.56254467476769" data-width="1399" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623175-4621567-diablo4paladinplayablenow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623175"></a><figcaption>A Paladin gazes from beneath their blood-soaked helmet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623175-4621567-diablo4paladinplayablenow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Could you tell us a bit more about the region that's coming with the expansion? Are there any real-life locations that inspired it, or parts of history?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Skovos is really cool, really unique, and interesting to Sanctuary. We mentioned earlier that Skovos is where Lilith, Inarius, and these other rebel angels and demons created Sanctuary, and then they hung out in Skovos. It wasn't necessarily called Skovos back then, but they lived there at the dawn of the world. This is where they created humans, or rather where they created the first humans: the Firstborn. When you think about this saga as a story of family, as Eleni said, or maybe as one about what humanity's fate is, it makes sense to bring this culmination with Mephisto to where humanity itself began. There's tons of Firstborn ruins and, sometimes, not even ruins--it's the modern-day people, the Askari. They've maintained this architecture, they live within it, and they see the Firstborn as part of their heritage in a way, even though it's distant.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot of different environments throughout these different islands. Each one of them has a unique theme and flavor. We explore a lot of the culture of this place, so you have the Amazons and you have this oracle order, this Order of Seers. We get to see how they work together and how they rule over this island nation to help it function and survive all this terrible stuff that's happening in other parts of Sanctuary.</p><p dir="ltr">But the big interesting point of conflict is that now the bad stuff that was happening in Sanctuary--the stuff that we saw in base game and Vessel of Hatred--now it's coming to Skovos. Mephisto, in the body of Akarat, has gathered a bunch of followers, he's brought them all to Skovos, and he's disrupting the order and the piece of this place. Anything you want to add to that, Eleni?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>I feel like you covered a lot of it, but it's really beautiful. It's stunning and it's a place that you haven't seen before, so I think that's really exciting. And there's just a lot to look at. There's water that you get to look at, and I know that's very small, but it's just… the environment team did a <em>really</em> good job. And in general, there's a lot of deep lore that we got a chance to explore there. I think that'll be really exciting for players who really love lore and players who are also just diving into Diablo for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: And compared to Vessel, how large is Lord of Hatred? How many hours of story can we expect?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera:</strong> I would say it's comparable to Vessel of Hatred. The map is pretty big. Like Matt said, there's a lot of lore stuff you get to explore in Skovos, so it's got quite a bit of content that the players get to dive into.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>PC Gamer: How do you approach creating a villain like Mephisto in a way that feels like a threat to the player, given that our player characters have just killed tons of demons that were already very powerful?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>It's narrative. It's understanding what a player's weakness is, right? And it's building that up and connecting the player to people like Neyrelle and Lorath. You have these stakes that get bigger and bigger because you care about them more. So when it comes to someone who's <em>so</em> powerful, or someone who can defeat all these demons, what really is the thing that will get them to crack? It's the people that they love, the people that they want to fight for, and Sanctuary. And when it comes to creating a really big villain, it's building off that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> When we first introduced [Mephisto] in the base game, part of the reason we introduced him that way is because he's not the antagonist in the story yet. We're hunting Lilith and he's helping us, and so it's creating this feeling of, "Yeah, I don't know if I should trust him or I shouldn't trust him, but he's sort of useful to me, so at what point will the usefulness wear out or will he turn the tables on me?" Because it's going to happen eventually, right? I think we wanted to introduce him that way just so that it would feel a little different than suddenly there's a prime evil sitting in front of you and you just want to fight him.</p><p dir="ltr">I mean Eleni said it perfectly: It's how his effect on the characters we care about--and on the world at large--raises the stakes. And again, we're continuing this thread of him always being a bit of a devil on our shoulder. We're not always working with the best characters--sometimes our allies are a little shifty, too. He exploits that reality. He makes us doubt, maybe sometimes our actions, and the people around us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: How do you make side quests feel like an organic part of the story when there's literally Satan running around?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>One thing that we've done is there are a number of side quests where it's a continuation of a character story that you meet in the main campaign. There are quests that follow an important character that you're around for some amount of time, and now you get to see what has happened to them after all these big events have unfolded. Yeah, Mephisto is running around and the stakes are so high, but what's going on with these other characters? It's about showing the aftermath of those big events, or showing the repercussions of the devil running loose.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>Yeah. I mean, the main story is so specific to our main characters, but the side quests are what breathe life into Sanctuary. They show us what everybody else is doing while the world is crumbling, and seeing intimate stories--seeing what other characters who maybe we know but they're not in the main quest--I think that gives us a chance as writers to dive deeper, and gives players get the chance to understand what these people are doing while there is this chaos. Life keeps on life-ing even when you've got Mephisto running amok. And I think that's the cool part about writing side quests.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: It seems like this idea of generational trauma is really at the core of this saga. Is that something that was intentional to this story? Are there some other ideas and themes that you were really hoping to get across and explore?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Yes. One of the themes that's present throughout is this idea of the passing of the torch, or like you said, it's sort of a generational… Maybe trauma is part of it, but also how you pass on legacy, and whether you can even pass it on at all. And in passing on a legacy, what kind of burden are you putting on the new people?</p><p dir="ltr">For Lilith wanting to protect Sanctuary, or for the Horadrim wanting to do their thing, these are not easy jobs, right? They require a lot of sacrifice. Sometimes the goal is noble, but passing it on can be hard because you know that you're dooming these people to a tough life. That's definitely a theme that we played with in base game and Vessel, and also we explore in Lord of Hatred as well.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also this prophecy in the base game, and I think it shows up in Vessel of Hatred too, that Rathma had. He had these visions and saw the Great Serpent, and this is still a part of the story. As Eleni said, fate is a big theme and so is this prophecy, how it's unfolding, what it actually means, and whether it must happen or can be avoided. This thing will unfold and be fulfilled, but maybe not in the way the characters necessarily suspect. There will be a lot of sacrifices and choices made by characters that there are no coming back from. [Lord of Hatred] is going to be a big, exciting culmination of everything that started in the base game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>PC Gamer: Could you talk a little bit more about Lilith coming back to the story and what her role is? I know there are quite a few players that really, really enjoyed her in the first game.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>We all love Lilith, right? She's cool, she's hot, she's our mom. I think it's really exciting we get a chance to see her in a new way. There's a lot of intimacy that we get to have with Lilith, and I think that we've always wanted to--or at least I've always wanted to--partner up with her. But Lilith will always be a demon at the end of the day. She has her own motivations and she's always going to have her own idea of what she wants in the world. So she has to decide whether or not she wants to ally with us for this bigger problem.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>The only thing I'd add is, again, it's about bringing these different threads to a close. In the base game, we were fed Lilith's blood petals--fed her blood. She's been a part of us this whole time. And though we defeated her in Hell, something of her has lived on in us. There's a presence inside of us that is slumbering basically. And now that we're going after Mephisto and the stakes are high and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, her presence within us really becomes a key to figuring out how to stop Mephisto. Like she said in the base game, "There would be no victory without me." That sort of idea, it's true--we will need her to fix this and to save Sanctuary from Mephisto.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623176-4144537-review_diablo4_site.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623176-4144537-review_diablo4_site.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623176"></a><figcaption>Lilith poses in front of a deep-red background.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4623176-4144537-review_diablo4_site.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: What inspired the decision to bring back Lilith so soon? Were you a bit worried about bringing her back or was it just something that seemed like, "Oh no, we have to do this?"</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Like when I mentioned earlier, before the base game actually released and we were planning out future stories, we always did want to bring her back. Then it became a question of when. It was about finding the right opportunity to do it and make it feel the most impactful to the story.</p><p dir="ltr">During [Vessel of Hatred's] development, we were toying around with the idea. We actually made some of these scenes where you heard her speaking. There was a scene where you saw her reflection or something like that too, but we cut those things out of Vessel because we were just trying to figure out, "Okay, where's the place where we should highlight that so that it feels like something really juicy and impactful and not just a little thing that happens and then there's no payoff for it yet?" You know what I mean?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>I feel like one of the biggest things is deciding how much payoff we want. We talk a lot about how this expansion is going to be super satisfying and everything will feel like it's tied together. Vessel of Hatred was the story of Neyrelle, it was <em>a</em> story of Mephisto, and it was about seeing what he could do without the power of being in Sanctuary. Now that he's out, it's seeing what he's going to do with this free will back in Sanctuary but masked as this major religious figure.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>One fun thing we're doing in Lord of Hatred that we didn't really do before is, with Lilith, you have different dialogue options for how you want to respond to her about certain things. We know that people have different feelings for her--whether she was right, whether she was wrong or whether they would've wanted to join her or not--and so we wanted to explore that through some of the dialogue you can have with her. Now, you get to see different ways she'll respond to you as well based on your decisions.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>I feel like Lilith is so nuanced and so complex. You get a mix of seduction and horror all at the same time and it's so cool and fun. And now we get a chance to really see her in a different way. When we last saw her we were fighting against her, but now there's a bigger issue. There's more at stake here, so it's her deciding what's important to her.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: You brought up that you now have options for how you want to interact with Lilith, and I thought that was really interesting because, right now, choice-driven, branching CRPGs are becoming more of the standard in the industry. Is that something that you've ever thought about exploring with Diablo? Having more choice throughout the story, exploring maybe different endings, different stories, and branching paths? Is that even possible in the structure of the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> I think it's cool and I enjoy that kind of stuff too. For Lord of Hatred, it's more in line with the base game and Vessel of Hatred. We don't do that kind of branching stuff. The choices I mentioned earlier, there's a number of places in the campaign where you have these different options of what to say, or how someone might respond to you, but it's more about giving the moment some interesting flavor. It's about allowing you to imagine your own story in this--who you are, your choices, or your opinion about something. It's giving you an opportunity to say it out loud, basically, even though it doesn't necessarily create a branched quest or storyline based on that. It's just about that opportunity of expression for your character or for some of the other characters too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>That's why we do it sometimes in side quests. It's not like you have two different paths, but I do think we get to explore a little bit of that. There was a side quest from, I think in Vessel of Hatred, that you get to have an alternate ending based on what you choose.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: Romance options? That's all I got.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Blizzard PR representative: </strong>Are you asking, "Can we hook up with Lilith?"</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: It's what everybody's thinking.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera:</strong> In terms of romance, we get to see a little bit of Lorath's past, which is something that we haven't really gotten a chance to see with other characters. He has interactions with Queen Adriana that we get to see. We also get to see a lot more of Lorath, how he was painted in the past, and who he was versus who he's become now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>PC Gamer: Is Lorath back? Are we going to hear more Ralph Ineson?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Yeah, Lorath is one of the main characters in the expansion. He's going to be with you almost all the time throughout the campaign, except the times you split up and you're off doing different things, right? But yeah, he's there, he's continuing his story. There's a lot about Lorath and the Horadrim in Lord of Hatred. And again, it goes back to the themes of legacy and the fate of the Horadrim.</p><p dir="ltr">We've been in VO sessions with Ralph recording all of his lines, and it's always great to hear his voice again. The moment you hear it, you're like, "Oh yeah, it's Lorath." That's been really fun and I'm super excited about Lorath's story in Lord of Hatred. I think it has a lot of great moments. He's a lot of fun to write as a character and, again, Ralph's voice is just amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">Another thing is Lorath has a history in Skovos, and that's something we'll explore in the campaign but, years and years ago, he came to Skovos with some other Horadrim and went on an adventure there. He met this Amazon named Adriana and they formed a bond, so he has some history with her. And now Adriana is the Amazon queen of Skovos. So with him coming back, there's a connection he has to this place that we're going to explore.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: I'm curious about how you guys are going to make players care about Akarat. The importance of the final cut scene of Vessel of Hatred might have been lost on people unless they're in deep on Diablo, but he's obviously a different type of puppet than a wolf. I'm curious about how you think about bringing Akarat as a character into the fold--and all the baggage that comes with him--and trying to explain why that matters while also showing this new version of the Lord of Hatred who is now walking around as a deity.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rivera: </strong>When it comes to Akarat, he's just going to appear as a normal man. I think what is going to really cut deep is the amount of people who are now rushing to get to Skovos; seeing the influence that he has because he's such a big figure in the world and he's been doing miracles in Sanctuary. The idea of all these people worshiping this person that you know as a player is Mephisto, I think that is where that terror starts to come.</p><p dir="ltr">He also has his Jedi mind tricks, right? Mephisto is very good at getting in your head. You think you see one thing, but really he's showing you something else and that's the power. We get a chance to show how Mephisto really plays with your emotions and I think that's the best part about him.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns: </strong>Just to add to that, a couple interesting things about Mephisto in this form--and ways to create interest for folks playing through it--is at first he's defying expectations, right? Yeah, he's a prime evil in this body, but he's not doing anything <em>bad</em>, which is interesting because that's how Mephisto was in the base game as well. Oftentimes, he's just telling you the truth. Maybe he's trying to get his own way by saying it, but he isn't always lying about things. Right now, he's just out there helping people and doing miracles. So it becomes this question, or this mystery, of what is he doing it all for? Why is he putting on this act? What's his end game for it all?</p><p dir="ltr">The other thing--and this ties into our themes--is that I think that Mephisto believes that humans don't really have any control over their fate. They're just cattle that more advanced entities or intelligent entities like him can lead around. What he's doing here is almost to prove a point to us, The Wanderer, and also to Lilith; you can create these things, these humans, and you can hope that they have some kind of free will or agency, but ultimately I'm going to show you that they don't. That's something else we play with, again, to just deepen his character a bit and make it more interesting.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>IGN: You have described Diablo IV as The Hatred Saga, and with this being the final confrontation with the Lord of Hatred, one would assume that that means that's the end of the aforementioned saga. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about Diablo IV's future. I'm assuming that there's going to be more Diablo IV after this.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burns:</strong> You're right in terms of us just looking at it as The Hatred Saga, and really that's been our focus--just bringing this story to a close in a really big and impactful way. But there are other stories to tell on Sanctuary, of course, though I can't really go into detail about any other stuff.</p><p><strong>Rivera:</strong> I think the best part is Diablo's live service. It gives us the opportunity to dive into whatever we want. Like Season 11, right? We get a chance to bring Hadriel back and we're getting a chance to talk to this angel that we only met briefly in Diablo II. We get to expand Hadriel's lore, which is really cool. We get a chance to always, possibly, tell new stories. But right now, we're just focusing on getting this expansion out and seeing what happens.</p><p><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>

The new area will feature seven new locations, six new characters, and several hours of new content, GSC Game World said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KCLiw3e-b8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4KCLiw3e-b8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">GSC Game World said players will want to pay "close attention" to the Red Forest region on the map, and from there use their intuition and rationality to see how deep this particular irradiated rabbit hole goes. Other points of interest in the Red Forest GSC Game World said will be worth players' time are the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 already sports over 30 weapons, but players will get one more to play with come the update in the form of the GP37V2 rifle, a weapon tailored for "tactically proficient players." The weapon isn't full auto, but can be fired in bursts or in single shots and comes pre-equipped with a suppressor and low-magnification scope.</p><p dir="ltr">"The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skilled operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power," GSC Game World said.</p><p dir="ltr">Other additions in the update include a new hub in the Burnt Forest area where players will find NPCs and be able to stash items. Existing locations will now be re-inhabited with other Stalkers as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, GameSpot traveled to GSC Game World's new office in Prague to talk to the Ukrainian development team about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">Stalker 2's harrowing development admist Russia's invasion</a> of their country and how an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-fire-threw-another-wrench-in-stalker-2s-development/1100-6529871/" data-ref-id="1100-6529871">office fire threw another wrench into its plans</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">Stalker 2 sold 1 million copies</a> shortly after launch in November 2024 despite also launching as a day-one Game Pass title, and went on to become on of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's 10 best games of 2024</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">At The Game Awards last week</a>, Capcom finally confirmed what we already knew, thanks to a myriad of leaks: that Leon Kennedy would not only be in Resident Evil Requiem but also be<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"> the second protagonist alongside the previously introduced Grace Ashcroft</a>, and that we would get to play as him.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">all the rumours</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">speculation</a>, and then the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">massive leak ahead of the official reveal</a>, it was good to finally see Leon in Requiem's trailer at The Game Awards, which felt like a sort of vindication for the internet after Capcom tried to deny he was involved.</p>



<p>Now that the secret is officially out, Capcom is already talking about Leon's appearance in Resident Evil Requiem and what he brings to the table alongside Grace Ashcroft. Of course, he's a fan-favourite character, but according to the game's director, Koji Nakinishi, Leon brings more than just his iconic status to Requiem, which is a striking contrast between him and Grace, and how differently players feel when controlling each of them.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60614">Famitsu</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/leon-kennedy-is-the-strongest-person-in-the-history-of-resident-evil-says-requiem-director-1648453/">Gamereactor</a>), Nakinishi called Grace the "<em>most fearful</em>" character in Resident Evil history, while Leon is "<em>the strongest</em>" in Resident Evil, according to Nakinishi. "<em>Grace is the most fearful person in the history of Resident Evil, and Leon is the strongest,</em>" Nakinishi said. "<em>I think one of the highlights will be seeing how these two contrasting characters interact</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We've crafted it to bring out the best in the contrasting characters of Leon and Grace</em>," Nakinishi continued. "<em>It's a gameplay experience unlike anything in the Resident Evil series before, so I hope you'll give it a try</em>."</p>



<p>A good horror game is able to strike a balance between how powerful the player feels and how vulnerable they feel in a given situation. Several games in the Resident Evil series are undoubtedly terrifying, but some of them, including entries featuring Leon, lose control of that balance before you hit credits, and you lose the fear-factor once you know you can bulldoze through any zombie or mangled creature the game puts in front of you.</p>



<p>It seems that with Resident Evil Requiem, Capcom is taking a very direct approach by having you play as both Grace and Leon for different scenarios. It'll be interesting to see how it executes that balance, and if the pendulum swings the other way at unexpected points, like finding yourself powerless while playing as Leon, and vice versa while playing as Grace.</p>



<p>Whatever Resident Evil Requiem has in store for players, we'll be able to find out when it arrives on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026</p>

            <p>
Right, shall we try again? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>! A game that was technically meant to be out by now, but is very obviously not out right now, is now a game that has a release month (no date, Bungie don't appear to be ready to share that one yet). That month is March, 2026, which I'm assuming has been chosen so that PlayStation manage to release one of their many promised but mostly cancelled live service games before the tax year wraps up.
</p>
<p>
This detail was confirmed in a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">blog post</a> and mini documentary of sorts that Bungie have shared, the blog post also confirming a price point finally (sort of). They're apparently "targeting" $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 as a price point, with more regional pricing to come closer to launch. Obviously inexpensive compared to most big name games these days, but perhaps a barrier too high for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> mired in deeply mixed responses.

<p>
Anyway, I won't run through everything, but let me detail some of the new bits shown off in the documentary. Complaints about being forced to play with others have been heard, as the game will feature a solo queue. Proximity chat has also been confirmed, a feature I'm sure will afford many a slur to be said simply for playing with a toy.
</p><p>
A brief insight into factions were shown off, where you might be tasked with looting a bunch of guns, or blowing up a ton of stuff. These factions all have upgrade trees that grant you various boons, a point I am already yawning at. There's this thing called The Codex that stores all the bits of lore, including things like audio logs and the like. Which, as a point, surely bits like that will be such a run killer? I wonder how that'll work into terms of the actual gameplay. It'll all just fall flat if you're just sitting on a menu listening to the story the game isn't actually telling.
</p>
<p>
The most crushing element of all of this is just how beautiful Marathon continues to look. Inside it is a world I'm desperate to explore, and yet I know in my heart that the game's PvP elements, we all can sense will be a hotbed of toxicity, will put me off the thing entirely. Admittedly I am not the core audience, I don't play many shooters anyway, but hotdog do I like some bold sci-fi.
</p>
<p>
What I can't stop thinking about since watching the mini doc is the very last line from one of the game's devs: "It's a mad dash to finish, but that's when you got to put in the elbow grease and the extra sweat and blood that it takes to get this done." Blood has been spilled, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">figuratively</a>, to get this thing made, and all I can hope is that for some of those that remain, getting it out is worth it.
</p>

                <p>Over 140 ROMs from Sega's long defunct Sega Channel, including service-exclusive games that were thought lost to time and never-before-published prototypes, have now been recovered thanks to the latest efforts of the Video Game History Foundation.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega Channel launched in 1994 and was one of the first subscription-based, digital game services, beaming new games and content directly to players' consoles through a television cable. The service shut down in 1998, and since then many of the exclusive games and content available on the service were thought to be gone forever.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWCUmTTVjMY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CWCUmTTVjMY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, until the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/segachannel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Game History Foundation</a> embarked on a quest to see the channel's unique history, and its content, preserved. Alongside former Sega Channel VP of programming Michael Shorrock and a passionate Sega fan who had acquired a collection of Sega Channel backup tapes, VGHF sought to tell the full story of the Sega Channel.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is 144 new ROMs that have been preserved, a new VGHF digital library collection that includes Shorrock's personal notes and presentations shedding light on the service (and an unannounced successor service called Express Games), and a documentary, Don't Just Watch TV: The Secrets of Sega Channel, which can be viewed on YouTube.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of its efforts, VGHF acquired a collection of ROMs that included some rare prototypes and games, including a never-before-seen Sega Genesis web browser and previously undumped game variants of Sega Channel-exclusive games, like Garfield: Caught in the Act - The Lost Levels and The Flintstones. According to VGHF, both games originated as abandoned projects that were then repurposed into exclusive Sega Channel content.</p><p dir="ltr">Also included in the files are previously unpreserved Sega Channel versions of games like Super Street Fighter II, which saw content removed in order to fit within Sega Channel's file-size limit. Other games on the service that were linear in nature were essentially split down the middle to fit within the file-size limit, with users needing a password to access the second half of the game. These split versions, as well as various "test drive" versions of games like Earthworm Jim and The Lost World: Jurassic Park that allowed Sega Channel players to play before their official release, have also been preserved.</p><p dir="ltr">"With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for almost all outstanding Sega Channel games," the VGHF states in its findings. "We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States."</p><p dir="ltr">The project to preserve Sega Channel is just one of VGHF's success stories this year, with the foundation previously announcing the launch of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-history-foundation-massive-digital-library-is-now-open-to-the-public/1100-6529151/" data-ref-id="1100-6529151">free-to-access digital resource library</a> for historians, researchers, and fans that includes more than 30,000 files from across 50 years of video game history.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-nintendo-switch-eshop-esrb-iarc-rating/</link>
            <guid>1383949</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For months after <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions/"><em><u>Tiny Bookshop</u></em></a> was released on Nintendo Switch in August, the indie game remained on the platform's bestseller list, hovering around the likes of <em>Hades 2</em> and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. But in late November, <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> dropped off the list—and off the Nintendo Switch eShop entirely—due to a discrepancy between its digital age and content rating and the rating tied to its upcoming physical version. <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> originally had an "E" rating—for everyone—but was upgraded to a "T for teens" rating.</p><p>The reason for the ratings upgrade? One word: "Arsehole," said Neoludic Games.</p><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> remained off the Nintendo Switch store in all regions for nearly two weeks, cutting into sales on what Neoludic Games says is its most prolific platform. "The impact was immediate and severe," Neoludic co-CEO and creative director David Zapfe-Wildemann told Aftermath.</p><p>"We noticed [the game wasn’t on the store] when people started reaching out via DM asking what was going on," he said. "Because there is a small delay between the Switch backend and the public web version, we didn't understand what was happening at first."</p><p>Neoludic Games wasn't notified that <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> was removed from the eShop until <em>after</em> it was taken down. "The process was completely opaque," Skystone Games (which published <em>Tiny Bookshop)</em> publishing head Dmitry Muratov said.</p><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> is a management simulator set in a mobile bookshop by a beach. Acting as the bookseller, players design the little shop and then sell books to customers; the puzzles are in finding the right real-world and fictional books to recommend. Neoludic Games describes <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> as "cozy," and it certainly is. The quaint bookshop is the epitome of the word, and the low-stakes gameplay makes the game very chilled out.</p><p>Muratov called the ratings process that caused the eShop removal a "black box" that the studio and publisher got caught up in. Most games have a rating, but games that are sold physically have a more "official" rating than those that are only sold digitally. The digital ratings system is handled through an automated system with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), which works with the different ratings agencies, like the ESRB. Developers fill out a survey through the IARC system to self-evaluate their game, which spits out an automated rating based on the answers. Developers then provide a certification of that rating to storefronts to be able to sell digitally.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Neoludic Games/Skystone Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>Zapfe-Wildemann said the digital certification through the IARC required very little detail and had "a lack of clear guidelines." Other developers who spoke to Aftermath about the IARC said the system can feel subjective—something that's especially relevant following the ratings debacle regarding Santa Ragione's <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><em><u>Horses</u></em></a>. <em>Horses</em> has been in the spotlight over the past several weeks after it was <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>removed from the Epic Games Store</u></a> for its rating; using the IARC process, Santa Ragione received a Mature rating. Epic Games filed its own IARC questionnaire and found the game to be ranked as Adults Only, therefore not publishable on its storefront. (Several developers and industry experts told Aftermath that they'd never heard of a platform filing for its own IARC rating.)&nbsp;</p><p>The IARC rating allows for games to display, for instance, an ESRB on a digital storefront. Crucially, it's a free-to-use tool that allows developers to get their games rated without much friction—and keeps rating bodies from being overwhelmed by having to have humans go through the hundreds of games released each month. IARC spits out a rating that's adaptable for the different regions a game is released in. One video game industry expert told Aftermath that rating bodies, like ESRB and PEGI, do run checks on IARC ratings to ensure accuracy, be it popular games or ones that get complaints.</p><p>Physical editions require a more detailed rating to be sold in stores, however, which made the ESRB and other countries' ratings processes necessary for <em>Tiny Bookshop</em>. That process is more robust and requires developers to submit footage, builds, and marketing materials, the expert said. The result is a formal rating from a thorough assessment of a game by a human.&nbsp;</p><p>"We started working together with a UK-based publisher for a physical release of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em>," Zapfe-Wildemann said. "That process mandated getting a detailed review by each target region's rating agency. In that re-review, the ESRB flagged the word 'Arsehole' in one of the 300+ book descriptions as severe enough to warrant a 'T' rating."</p><p>Neoludic Games only learned of the upgraded rating <em>after</em> Nintendo delisted the game and the process was completed. "It would have been five minutes of work to replace the word had we been informed, or had we had a way to track which swear word is considered severe in the IARC system," Zapfe-Wildemann said.</p><p>"A single word in more than 100,000 words of localization was caught and scrutinized without a chance for us to fix it pre-release," Muratov said. "It’s frustrating when you see massive AAA games with much more mature themes, while a cozy bookshop game gets pulled over a single instance of text."</p><p>The upgraded T rating triggered a "mandatory update to the digital store," Zapfe-Wildemann said, which resulted in the "immediate delisting" of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em>. On Oct. 17, which is the last date the best-sellers page was recorded by the Wayback Machine, <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> was in the ninth row of the U.S. bestsellers. (In September, it was listed 12th on the page, and in August, it was the second game. In the first month alone, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2133760/view/542241191160185439?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Neoludic Games sold more than 300,000 copies of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em></u></a>. By December, that number surpassed 500,000.) Being removed from the Nintendo Switch eShop dropped <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> from the list, Neoludic Games said. Now, after being re-added in early December, it's much further down the page in the U.S. region. Neoludic Games estimated that it lost 10,000 sales due to the removal from the eShop and its subsequent absence from the bestsellers list.</p><p>"On Switch, the bestseller list is one of the most critical discoverability tools the platform has," Zapfe-Wildemann said. "Our release momentum was still carrying us in the charts of some regions when the incident happened. It is incredibly difficult to re-enter those charts once that momentum is broken."</p><p>Muratov said that getting back into the bestsellers list is "very hard or impossible," but that the studio managed to get back into the top 30 recently. "That couldn't have happened without an amazing worldwide community rallying behind us," he said.</p>

            <guid>1383922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been playing Obsidian Entertainment’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></a> I really like it! And after wrapping the game up over the weekend, I realized that I just played the closest thing to <em>Fallout 5</em> that I’ll get until Bethesda finally ships the wasteland RPG in, like, a decade from now.</p> <p><em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, is the much bigger and better follow-up to Obsidian’s original<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-outer-worlds"><em> Outer Worlds</em> from 2016</a>. While both games are open-world space RPGs, the sequel expands on every part of the original game, featuring more planets, weapons, enemies, skills, factions, and features. And like the original, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is clearly inspired by Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games and Obsidian’s own <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</em> The original got close to emulating the experience of playing (and screwing around in) a <em>Fallout</em> RPG, but due to a limited budget and scope, didn’t quite nail it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> does, and it’s wonderful.</p>

 <p>Everything I love about Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games is here. Hand-crafted areas to explore, filled with stretches of empty land, bustling communities, and odd characters and situations to stumble into. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> also features an in-depth RPG system with a massive list of perks and skills to level up, letting you build a smooth-talking scam artist, a beefy melee warrior, or a super-smart sniper able to hack any robot. Or you could create a murderous, evil idiot who is super lucky. And the best part is, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599">like in<em> Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em></a>, the world reacts to your choices and offers up ways to use those skills and perks to your advantage.</p>

 <p>I mean, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> even includes the ability to turn on an <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-soundtrack-interview">in-game radio and listen to in-world music, DJs, ads, and more</a> as you hike about the various planets, completing quests and discovering new locations. This is a key part of the <em>Fallout</em> formula for me and something I was happy to see included in <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>. Blowing up random enemies with a laser gun is just more fun when retro music is blaring in the background.</p>

  <p>And unlike Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games,<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em> doesn’t feel like it’s falling apart as you continue to play. It also features much better writing, more interesting companions, better combat, and far fewer bugs. In my many, many hours with <em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> I only had to reload a save due to a bug once, and only encountered one other really annoying game-breaking glitch. Beyond that, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a more stable and better-looking spin on the Bethesda RPG formula.</p> <p>If you’re someone who has been craving a new <em>Fallout</em> and doesn’t want to replay <em>Fallout 3</em> o<em>r New Vegas</em> for the 20th time, I’d highly recommend<em> Outer Worlds 2</em>. It’s probably the closest thing to a <em>Fallout 5</em> we’ll be getting from an Xbox-owned studio any time soon, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-v-bethesda-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-starf-1849062025"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still likely years away, and the next <em>Fallout</em> will only arrive once Bethesda is done with that</a>. Thankfully, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is pretty dang rad and is highly replayable. A good way to kill a few years while you wait for <em>Fallout 5.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Steve Rogers was supposed to retire with Peggy after time-traveling to the past at the end of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023"><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i></a><span>, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been struggling lately, so the man is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766"><span>back in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, as if Disney has broken him out of an “in case of emergency” case. According to Hollywood leaker </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/2000541109412364416?s=20"><span>Daniel Richtman</span></a><span>, Marvel is reportedly putting out multiple theater-exclusive teasers featuring some returning characters for the film, and the first will star Chris Evans as the man formerly known as Captain America. From the looks of it, the video may have leaked if you want to get a glimpse into the cozy life of the OG Cap.</span></p> <p><span>The supposed teaser that is now circulating online is not of great quality, but it shows Steve getting off a motorcycle and walking into his home to stare nostalgically at his old suit, and then lovingly at a cute little baby. The video plays a sparse piano version of the official Avengers theme, and then the text “Steve Rogers will return in Avengers Doomsday” shows up on a black screen. Because the quality is so poor, it’s entirely possible this could be an AI fake that someone is passing off as a real tease, but any telltale signs of AI slop are masked by the bad recording. However, some folks are reporting that Marvel is hitting these videos with a DMCA strike, so make of that what you will. The teaser will reportedly make an official debut in theaters ahead of </span><i><span>Avatar: Fire and Ash </span></i><span>later this week.</span></p>

   <p><span>Earlier this morning, directors the Russo Brothers posted a close-up image on their Instagram account of…something…with the hashtag #AvengersDoomsday on it. It might be a close-up from this trailer. If you squint hard enough, it kinda looks like a close-up of a motorcycle wheel. Maybe?</span></p>   <p><span>According to Richtman, more teasers will follow, including ones featuring Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom. A fourth teaser and final teaser will be more “general” and focus on the broader cast.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not a groundbreaking observation, but Marvel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><span>leaning into the original </span><i><span>Avengers </span></i><span>cast</span></a><span> to tease the next movie, which was once </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-5-kang-dynasty-name-change-rework-1851275299"><span>supposed to be about a different group of heroes and villains</span></a><span>, is one of the most pathetic, groveling moves the company could be making right now. But it was clear from the moment the company cast Downey Jr. as Doom that </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>would be an expensive exercise in playing the hits. Why would you bring back a bunch of actors from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571"><span>old </span><i><span>X-Men </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span> unless you were banking on nostalgia above all else? Yanking Steve Rogers out of his cozy life is one of the most transparent examples of this. We’ll see how Marvel uses the character when </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>premieres on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163"><span>December 18, 2026</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Rainbow Six Siege celebrated its 10-year anniversary at the beginning of this month, on December 1, 2025, and as part of the celebrations, Ubisoft has put out <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/events/wildcards-siege">a new limited-time mode titled Wildcards</a>, which'll be available from December 15, 2025, to January 5, 2026.</p>



<p>The new mode takes players back through the game's history by making every match more chaotic than the last with different modifiers. A modifier could limit your choice of operator, of weapons, and even add a new element to gameplay, like a massive Chicken appearing in your face as a callback to an iconic moment in Rainbow Six Siege's 10-year history.</p>



<p>There are 28 total modifiers, including Multipick, which lets teams pick the same Operator multiple times. Frag Domination, which randomly spawns frag grenades during the round. Frag Grenade Cooking, which equips attackers with the 556XI and defenders with the MP5K. Both teams still get grenades they can cook and throw.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Each round begins with a vote, where players will vote for their preferred modifier. Votes from both attackers and defenders are tallied together, and in the case of a tie, a modifier is randomly selected. It's a purposely chaotic mode that seems to try to hit at all of Siege's best points.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege recently underwent its most significant change in the last decade when it became a free-to-play game with the Rainbow Six Siege X update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">which Ubisoft released this past June</a>. It was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/">biggest graphical update in the game's history</a>, and gave players the chance to, for free, play unranked, quick match, and dual front modes and play as a small selection of Operators. </p>



<p>You can take advantage of that free content as much as you like, and if you do want to go further in the game, you can grab the Elite Edition, which adds 16 more Operators and access to all game modes, ranked playlists, and the Siege Cup for $19.99. The Ultimate Edition includes all of that and access to all 52 Operators for $39.99.</p>

            <guid>1383883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has arrived with new details about Marathon, discussing all the improvements, reconfirming the March 2026 release window, pricing, new features, and more. </p>



<p>Marathon and Bungie have not had the best time since the title’s reveal and initial playtests, thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism fiasco</a> and all the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong player feedback</a>. The title has been undergoing constant playtesting since then, and the developers have finally arrived with new information about their vision for Marathon. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pricing-details-revealed-battle-passes-never-expire">Marathon Pricing Details Revealed, Battle Passes Never Expire</h2>



<p>A new video by Bungie confirms Marathon’s March 2026 release window, reveals pricing details, provides new battle pass information, and much more. The developers are targeting a price of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 currently and will announce regional pricing closer to launch. Purchasing the title will give players full access to the base game, including free gameplay updates, new maps, Runner shells, events, and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, Marathon Battle Passes will never expire, which means players don’t need to keep logging in due to the “fear of missing out”. You will be able to purchase and unlock prior passes. The developers have also confirmed that “survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” so there will be no pay-to-win elements in Marathon. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-devs-reveal-new-features-and-improvements">Marathon Devs Reveal New Features and Improvements</h2>



<p>Coming to the improvements, the new Vision of Marathon video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> reveals all the changes the developers have made since the alpha and their plan for the game. Starting with the latest features since alpha, players will see that Proximity chat and solo queue have been added. There’s also a new Runner Shell called Rook, which is designed to let players enter matches in progress, loot a bit, and escape without too much risk. </p>



<p>The game has also made some improvements to visual fidelity, with corpses now remaining in the match and decaying over time. Additionally, environmental storytelling has been deepened. Immersion has also improved thanks to the role audio plays. The developers have stated that audio is a major gameplay element in Marathon, with every sound serving a purpose. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-map-details">Marathon Map Details</h2>



<p>The developers then dived into Marathon’s Zones, the game’s maps. First is Perimeter, which is on the outskirts of the colony and spread out. The next is Dire Marsh, where players not only get a sense of the game’s story but also experience a different style of gameplay, focused more on action. The third map is called Outpost, a UESC facility with many PvE elements, including guards, drones, trip wires, and more.</p>



<p>The fourth map is The Marathon Ship’s Cryo Archive, which is the hardest place to survive in the game, and no point going there without the best loot. Each map features different weather systems and dynamic events. These events don’t happen all the time, but the players will know when they do, and then it is up to them whether they want to risk it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-weapons-and-loot-details">Marathon Weapons and Loot Details </h2>



<p>There’s a lot of loot for Marathon players to look forward to, including Runner cores, implants, and over 400 weapon mods. The game also offers a lot of customisation, allowing players to mix and match their weapons in unique ways. The devs showed examples of turning the Battery SMG into a needler and turning invisible with mods on their sidearm. Each of the game’s launch Runner Shell is an archetype of gameplay, which can be upgraded upon. </p>



<p>Lastly, the game has Factions, and agents of these Factions can ask you to jobs like “blow up a UESC dropship”, etc. Factions have upgrade trees and capstone rewards that players can earn each season. </p>

            <guid>1383877</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie’s Marathon has a new release window after it was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/marathon-delayed-indefinitely-from-september-release">pushed out</a> of its original September 23 launch date. The upcoming multiplayer extraction shooter will now be released in March, and Bungie has shared a new documentary sharing its updated vision for the game</p><p>Among other things, the near-23-minute documentary discusses how Bungie is “doubling down” on the Marathon's dark, grounded sci-fi world. The game centers on players controlling bio-cybernetic characters called Runners exploring and scavenging the lost colony of Tau Ceti IV. Runners accomplish this by transferring their consciousness into Shells, high-tech bodies sporting unique capabilities.</p><p>The video dives into the new features added to the PvPvE experience since the playable alpha, such as proximity chat, solo queue, and a new Runner shell called Rook. We also get a look at Marathon’s four maps, its copious amount of loot, the various factions players will perform jobs for, and a showcase of the game’s improved visual fidelity, audio, and environmental storytelling.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to sharing the March launch window. Bungie states that the game will be priced at $39.99. Owners will be treated to free gameplay updates throughout the first year, including new maps, new Runner shells, live events, and more. This will kick off with the Season 1 exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive.&nbsp;</p><p>Bungie also shares that Marathon’s Reward Pass – essentially a battle pass – does not expire, and you can also purchase and unlock prior passes. Bungie hopes this will eliminate the FOMO that players can feel by not logging in regularly. The studio promises that Marathon will never devolve into a “pay-to-win” experience. “We believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” reads the team’s <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">blog post.</a></p><p>It seems Bungie is taking players' concerns to heart, but it remains to be seen if Marathon can right the ship after some shaky first impressions. First revealed in May 2023, the game now faces some stiff competition in the form of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/arc-raiders/consequential-and-worthwhile-multiplayer">Arc Raiders</a>, a similarly designed extraction shooter that launched on October 30 to a glowing reception from critics and fans. Marathon has also been a subject of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">controversy surrounding plagiarized art assets</a> that appeared in the game. Earlier this month, it was reported that the issue <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">had been resolved</a>.&nbsp;Here's hoping Marathon is back on track on the road to its launch next spring.&nbsp;</p><p>Marathon launches in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/marathon-launches-next-march-as-bungie-shares-an-updated-look-at-the-game-in-action]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Six month after announcing an indefinite delay for Marathon in response to "passionate" community feedback, Bungie has slapped its live-service extraction shooter with a release window and price, confirming it'll launch for PlayStation 5 and PC in March next year for £35.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but it wasn't until April this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">more</a> - that the troubled project finally got its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>. Unfortunately, the response was less-than-positive, and a subsequent alpha playtest proved equally divisive. As a result, Bungie revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Marathon would no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced</a>, and would instead be indefinitely delayed to make improvements.

<p>
There's been little concrete news on Marathon's progress since then, although Sony chief financial officer Lin Tao did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">reference the title last month</a>, revealing it was still set to release within the company's current financial year. And Bungie has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/marathon-vidoc-highlights-the-extraction-shooters-dark-world-and-survival-challenge/">narrowed that down further</a>, confirming the extraction shooter will launch in March 2026. Additionally, it'll cost £34.99/$39.99/€39.99 - the same price as Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">ill-fated shooter Concord</a>.
</p><p>
Confirmation of Marathon's release window was accompanied by a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J91kh56jiA">20-minute gameplay breakdown</a>, with Bungie outlining a number of enhancements made since April's divisive play test. These include improvements to visual fidelity, proximity chat, a Solo Runner queue, and a "solo scavenger experience" titled Rook. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether you were with us back in April for our first Alpha or you're just joining us now," Bungie wrote on the PlayStation Blog, "there's a rich world full of lore and loot for you to discover when your cybernetic biosynthetic shell takes its first steps into our new world."

<figure data-uuid="6eb2fc5d4e700"><a title="Fire Emblem Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6eb2fc5d4e700/fire-emblem-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Metacritic's annual round-up of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/worst-videogames-of-2025/9/">worst reviewed games</a> of the year is upon us. And, by and large, there have been a <em>lot</em> of good video games in 2025. But there will always be a few that hit the bottom. And, well, if you've been keeping up with gaming news this year, number one shouldn't surprise you.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the aggregate site determines the list based on games released between <strong>1st January and 31st December 2025</strong> and with at least four critic reviews. Obviously some games will have more than others on this list, so make of that what you will. And in multiplatform releases, only the lowest-scoring platform will appear here.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067isvjgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So, while number one should be fairly obvious to guess, number two was a bit of a sobering reminder. Remember earlier this year when Nintendo shadow-dropped a Fire Emblem game on mobile? And that it's a social deduction game? Uh, yeah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> happened, and, yeah it seems like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/mobile/fire-emblem-shadows">we weren't the only ones who didn't like the game</a>. The iOS version sits on a Metascore of 37, and user reviews aren't any better.<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><br></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spy_drops">Spy Drops</a> (the PS5 version), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fast_and_furious_arcade_edition">Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition</a> (PS5), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/glover">QUByte Classics: Glover</a> (PS5) have also all made the list <em>and</em> are all available on Switch 1 and 2.</p>
<p>But nothing could really top <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mindseye">MindsEye</a> this year, could it? Just read our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/mindseye">sister site Push Square's review</a> and... <em>ouch</em>. Anyway, here's the list in full:</p>
