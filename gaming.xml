<p>The new year is finally upon us, and with that comes a whole horde of new games to think about — <em>yipee!</em></p>
<p>2026 is already looking pretty stacked, and while January is usually one of the quieter months in the release calendar, there are still a handful of big hitters coming our way over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Here to highlight the cream of the crop are the wonderful Alex and Alana, who you'll find chatting about eight awesome up-and-comers in the video above. There's a bit of everything, from first-party favourites to lesser-known delights. So, grab a beverage and prepare to make those wishlists a little bit longer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you prefer your lists in written form, you'll find the eight highlights down below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where Winds Meet v1.2 Arrives This Month with Large-Scale Battles and the Most Intense ‘Helping Seniors Cross the Street’ Game Mode Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-update-1-2-january-2026-roadmap/</link>
            <guid>1398334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>NetEase Games just unveiled the January 2026 roadmap for <strong>Where Winds Meet,</strong> the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/where-winds-meet-everything-we-know-about-the-wuxia-open-world-action-adventure-rpg/">new open-world, Wuxia action RPG</a> that arrived in November 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-december-2025-roadmap/">After last month's batch of updates introduced a new region for players to explore and new bosses</a>, the roadmap for January is more stacked with new events, story content, and what looks like the most intense version of helping the elderly get to where they need to go with <strong>Elder Express</strong>.</p>



<p>The headline for the January 2026 roadmap is the arrival of Where Winds Meet version 1.2, which introduces several elements to the game, including the Nine Mortal Ways Camp, a new puzzle cave called Mistveil Prison. It also includes the final Kaifeng volume and a new campaign challenge boss called Supreme Freedom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/31.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: NetEase Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The other big addition with v1.2 is the introduction of large-scale multiplayer combat in Guild Battle Preseason. Guild Battles are coordinated efforts that will require you to work with your fellow guild members to secure a victory. If you try to win it solo, you'll do so at your own peril.</p>



<p>As this is NetEase's first introduction of these battles, the Preseason is a short, six-match tournament that is more about letting players try out the new mode so NetEase can see what players like, dislike, and how it can be adapted. "<em>This preseason is crucial for us to gather player feedback and refine the core Guild Battle mechanics</em>," said NetEase Games in a press release. "<em>We encourage all guilds to rally their members, hone their tactics, and prepare for the even more expansive guild content planned in upcoming updates</em>."</p>



<p>While the incoming content for January 2026 has already started to roll in with the new Unbound Solo mode and the new Hero's Realm having arrived on January 4, everything else will arrive this Friday with the version 1.2 update beginning on <strong>January 9, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Including Elder Express, a new game mode that sees you run through the streets with an elderly person on your back, which players can jump in and out of without any prerequisites.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/41.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: NetEase Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In just its first month, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-surpassed-15-million-players-in-its-first-month/">surpassed 15 million players around the world</a>, after already hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/">9 million players before the game even made it to mobile devices</a>. It's been the latest massive launch from NetEase Games, following the studio's hit shooter, Marvel Rivals. </p>



<p>Even though it's still very early in the game's life, its rocket-ship launch makes it seem like NetEase is about to start dominating yet another genre within live service games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">In Wccftech's review,</a> Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

            <p>007: First Light may not be the choppy, stuttering overextender of gratuitous explosi-pixels that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-first-proper-footage-reveals-a-posh-blockbuster-with-bubbles-of-hitman">its big action reveal</a> led us to believe. The official PC system requirements are out, and they’re very reasonable indeed, only asking for old mid-range <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> and merely halfway decent CPUs. Could IO Interactive have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-has-been-delayed-so-hitman-devs-io-can-further-buff-the-bondage">delayed their young Bond adventure to May 27th</a> so as to polish up performance, especially around the more Brosnan-era detonationfests in that footage? Maybe, maybe not. But at least you won’t need John Cleese to build you a machine that can run it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Unusually, the microfilm containing these specs was dropped in our inboxes along with a gushing quote from IOI’s Ulas Karademir about how jolly good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">Nvidia DLSS 4</a> is. Thus, First Light will come with a suite of RTX toggles, including DLSS upscaling and frame generation – with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) for GeForce RTX 50 series card owners. It should, therefore, also work with the newly announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-reveals-dlss-45-with-anti-aliasing-upgrades-and-a-dynamic-if-slightly-mad-6x-frame-gen-mode">DLSS 4.5</a> and its Dynamic MFG mode.</p>
<p>Full specs as follows:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First Light isn’t a lightweight game, claiming an 80GB storage minimum, though other than maybe wanting 32GB of RAM for recommended hardware – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">what, in this economy?</a> – it’s relatively easygoing for a modern action-adventure. The likes of the RTX 3060 Ti and Radeon RX 6700 XT for 1080p/60fps aren’t excessive at all, and that storage requirement doesn’t even specify that it needs to be on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> instead of an old hard drive.</p><p>Perhaps I’m overextrapolating with the idea that lower PC specs mean an absence of performance issues, and ultimately these lists don’t cover the kind of hardware you’d need for maxed-out 1440p, 4K, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide</a> play. But a lower entry level almost always carries into lower requirements on luxury settings too, and it’s encouraging that First Light runs on a version of same Glacier Engine that IOI use for the Hitman games. The most recent of which, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">World of Assassination</a>, runs like water on hardware as simple as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. When it doesn’t have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitman-3-ray-tracing-performance">ray tracing enabled</a>, anyway.</p>

            <guid>1398325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a new laptop today? You’re in luck. Amazon is offering plenty of discounts across a wide range of categories, including laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">One of our favorite discounts is this 78% drop on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which brings its price down to just $440.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving over $1,500 on a machine that is made to handle all your everyday work and entertainment needs like a pro. Even better, if you place your orders today, you will also enjoy free shipping on your purchase, which sweetens the deal even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Made for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>IdeaPad Slim 3 is a lightweight laptop with a basic, yet sleek design. You’re getting a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS display that delivers a stunning 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life. Whether you’re catching up on the last episode of Pluribus or creating a work presentation, expect vivid details and vibrant colors. The narrow bezels offer a larger screen real estate to work on, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals consistent across all lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Right above the screen is a built-in 720p webcam with a privacy shutter for easier video calls. You will be able to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external device. Those who need to type long documents and fill spreadsheets often will also appreciate the full-sized keyboard that features a dedicated numeric keypad. It’s comfortable to use, so you won’t have to deal with sore wrists at the end of a productive day.</p>
<p>Speaking of productivity, the laptop runs on a modest 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13420H processor with 8 cores and 12 threads. It’s made to handle regular tasks – think browsing, streaming, light office work, studying – without slowing you down. The processor is paired with an 8GB DDR5 SDRAM memory that keeps things running smoothly as you work or play. That said, it’s not designed for heavy workloads, so you won’t exactly be able to work on demanding tasks. But as long as your needs are fairly standard, it should get the job done just fine.</p>



<p>Storage capacity is better than most options in this range. You’re getting a spacious 512GB SSD that can house your entire multimedia library on your PC, and more easily. SSDs also offer much faster boot and load times than their traditional counterparts, so you’ll also be able to launch programs and move files around more efficiently.</p>
<p>Connectivity options are just as impressive. You’ve got WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless connections, plus a wide range of ports including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one power connector. Translation? You can easily connect a bunch of peripherals like a mouse, a portable screen, microphones, etc, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home also comes pre-installed, which means you can get started with using the machine right away.</p>
<p>Altogether, in a compact, lightweight build, the IdeaPad Slim 3 packs a wide range of features and impressive power for regular tasks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">You’re getting a spacious display, a full-sized keyboard, a modest processor, and a spacious SSD for under $450 here</a>. Keep in mind that the deal is only around for a short time. The discount is likely going to expire soon, so it’s best to lock it in quickly.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-new-content/</link>
            <guid>1398322</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of waiting, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is receiving a slew of new content in the 3.0 update, releasing alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade of the game.</p>



<p>Six years after it was first released, and four years on from the 2.0 update, Animal Crossing: New Horizons receives the 3<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-switch-2-edition-exact-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.0 update on January 15</a>, bringing new content, new villagers, and more to the game.</p>



<p>For a complete rundown on everything being added in the update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-new-content-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update">All New Content in Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 Update</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New tasks. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-new-amp-returning-villagers">New &amp; Returning Villagers</h3>



<p>Four additional villagers will become available in Animal Crossing: New Horizons with the 3.0 update, although the process to add them to your island requires using an Amiibo, and they cannot be invited to your island without them.</p>



<p>Mineru and Tulin are the two new additions, from the Legends of Zelda Amiibos, while Cece and Viche are returning villagers, available by scanning Splatoon Amiibos.</p>



<p>Without the use of Amiibos, none of the four additional villagers coming to New Horizons in the 3.0 update can be invited to your island.</p>



<h3 id="h-quality-of-life-improvements">Quality-of-Life Improvements</h3>



<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are introduced in the 3.0 update, increasing the maximum amount of available storage to 9,000, along with the ability to place trees, bushes, andd flowers inside storage.</p>



<p>When crafting, you are able to select the number of items in total you want to craft, rather than having to do one at a time, and crafting now pulls materials from storage, meaning you will no longer have to have all the materials required in your pockets.</p>



<p>Finally, when terraforming, movement changes make it easier to build or remove fences, paths, cliffs, and rivers on a single axis, with quick steps in a single direction.</p>

<h3 id="h-resort-hotel">Resort Hotel</h3>



<p>The biggest gameplay addition in the New Horizons 3.0 update is the Resort Hotel, where players are tasked to design rooms for guests matching a specified theme.  Tourists will visit the island and can be found wandering around, with the ability to invite specific villagers using Amiibo. </p>



<p>Completing requests earns Hotel Tickets, used to claim goods at the souvenir shop run by Grams, and Hotel Tickets are also earned by fulfilling requests for DIY goods, which also increases the hotel’s international brand recognition.</p>



<p>Additionally, the hotel lobby has two mannequins that can be dressed with custom outfits, which both animal and human visitors can borrow to wear.</p>



<h3 id="h-reset-service">Reset Service</h3>



<p>Mr. Resetti’s island Reset Service is added in the 3.0 update, allowing players to easily clear specific areas of the island. When doing so, you can choose for items to be disposed of, or placed into storage.</p>



<p>The Reset Service can also be used to clear planted flowers and custom designs, making it much easier to give your island a new makeover.</p>



<h3 id="h-slumber-islands">Slumber Islands</h3>



<p>Slumber Islands are available in a new dream world, with each player able to create up to three. There is a selection of random layouts, and three varying sizes.</p>



<p>Islands can be fully terraformed and decorated with items from a player’s catalog, while the time of day and weather can also be set. Lloid is available to construct bridges and inclines on demand.</p>



<p>You can also invite other players to join your Slumber Island via multiplayer and work together crafting the island.</p>



<h3 id="h-collaborations">Collaborations</h3>



<p>Several collaborations are added in the New Horizons 3.0 update, bringing a host of new items, decorations, and rare furniture items into the game.</p>



<p>Grams’ souvenir shop stocks rare furniture items as the Hotel’s brand recognition increases, themed on classic Nintendo consoles and retro toys. With an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, players can select and play games on the consoles, with Clu Clu Land, ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Panel de Pon, and F-Zero available.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, LEGO-themed furniture is added to Nook Shopping, and can be purchased when it becomes available. There are also themed items from The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon available when compatible Amiibos are scanned.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> has released its latest Savage-tier raid today, pushing the game's best and brightest to race through this new challenge group content to earn powerful loot and see which region can take it down first. However, for Americans, this is proving difficult due to ongoing DDOS attacks and server outages.</p>
<p>With the release of patch 7.4 last month, players were welcomed back to the game with a bunch of new content to pour over. The Savage difficulty for the Heavyweight raid, which was delayed until after the holiday season, has just come out resulting in the usual rush to see which team can take it down first.</p>
<p>The problem comes from DDOS attacks. American players, obviously present on different servers than like-minded raiders in other regions, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1q5f3a8/3_ddos_attacks_within_30_minutes_on_savage_launch/">are facing a spree of connection issues</a> as the servers are bombarded with digital assaults from nefarious parties. Checking the FF14 server status page, <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/worldstatus/">you can see a sizable portion of America servers under strain</a>.</p>

<p>This has resulted in chaos for the race for world first Heavyweight Savage clears, as American teams are scrambling to contend with these extra hurdles. Players looking to temporarily hop to different servers, such as Oceania's Materia server cluster, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elanortrevelyan.bsky.social/post/3mbqtnxkwgk2i">aren't safe from these attacks either</a>. The only way to dodge such attacks at this time appears to be a full-on server transfer to another region, which would add additional latency to play which top-end players tackling difficult content wouldn't want anyway. A messy situation.</p><p>Funnily enough, it appears as though Japanese servers are largely doing just fine during the initial release of Savage Heavyweights so far! This is both good and bad. It's good because these server outages are annoying and the less people experience them the better. It's bad because, from the perspective of competitive raiders looking to race each other to a world first clear, it adds a degree of unfairness to the mix. It takes what should be a joyful moment and sours it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this Savage raid release isn't the first time problems like these have hit Final Fantasy 14. In fact,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1prw7jp/ongoing_ddos_issues_megathread/"> it was only around two weeks ago when the American servers suffered several DDOS attacks</a>. For Western FF14 players, this is a problem in desperate need of addressing, especially now that it's impacted one of the more climactic moments in the Dawntrail expansion's life cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/95416d3ef7713bab8490aab037051362b63a074b">A short post on the Final Fantasy 14 website</a> has acknowledged the problem, and states that it's being looked into. However, given the time sensitive nature of these Savage raid races, it's possible for the most dedicated FF14 players, the damage has been done.</p>

<header><section>
<p>Pineapple Express</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We reviewed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/suika_game">Suika Game</a> back when it released on Switch in 2023, giving it a 7/10 and calling it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/suika-game">"ripe little puzzler"</a>, and one that you can nab for less than £3. A good thing in this economy, we can all agree.</p>
<p>Now, fans of Suika's puzzling charms can dive into the game's equally colourful-looking sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, which is available to purchase right this very moment for both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suika-game-planet-switch-2/">US eShop</a> (cheers for the heads-up <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/01/06/us-suika-game-planet-now-available-in-nintendo-eshop/">MyNintendoNews</a>). It's priced at <strong>$3.75</strong> on Switch 2, and <strong>$2.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Sadly, there doesn't seem to be an upgrade path (though the game is pretty cheap anyway) and as things currently stand, the game is currently <em>only</em> available on the US eShop. We'll be sure to keep an eye out for it landing in other regions, if and when it does so.</p>
<p>This new sequel moves the breezy puzzle action to space for some intergalactic shenanigans that see you control the dropping of fruit into the centre of your screen in order to pair off and combo from your positioning of fruit types.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A new Suika Game is here from a new setting in space! Turn, target, and aim for the watermelon!</strong></p>
<p>Drop the fruits freely from any direction as ""Poppy"" flies 360° around the planet. Make fruits of the same type collide to make them ""evolve"" and aim to create watermelons for a high score!</p>
<p>Make a lot of fruits ""evolve"" to enter the new ""Super Evolution Time"" mode! Special background music, dramatic effects, and a bonus score bring the excitement to a peak!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch 2 version of the game also supports the console's GameShare function, allowing for up to four players to hash it out in competitive play which, given the style of the puzzling at hand, could get pretty intense and enjoyable. So that's a neat and meaningful addition, especially given the game's ultra-low price tag!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS has announced an expansion thanks to the simulator's widespread success, rendering the outfit "an actual game studio", in TVGS' own words.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/523111043238464175" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, TVGS now has a central office location in Sydney, and the studio has also been able to hire a new developer (whose name is Rob, if you're interested).&nbsp;</p><p>A new 3D and technical artist will also be recruited soon; TVGS says that by the end of 2026, there will "likely be four people working on <em>Schedule I</em>". That might not sound like much, but given that the game is essentially a solo effort right now, that's pretty impressive.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS is doing pretty well for itself, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as revealing the new office, TVGS also says it's releasing a <em>Schedule I </em>patch next week, but don't get too excited; it'll mainly consist of "bug fixing and QoL improvements", in the studio's own words.</p><p>Following that update, the remainder of January will be spent "cleaning up the codebase" and bringing new developer Rob up to speed; TVGS says he's got to "catch up on 120k+ lines of code", so it's not going to be an easy job for him.</p><p>Once all of this is taken care of, TVGS says it will "get to work on the next update", but the studio says it's learned its lesson from prior update delays, so the next major patch for <em>Schedule I </em>won't be announced until TVGS is "confident we'll hit it on time".</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Schedule I </em>is, well, there's no easy way to say this: it's a drug-dealing simulator that lets you peddle illicit substances to all and sundry. Clutch your pearls as you will.</p>
<p><em>Schedule I </em>has indeed proven very successful; at last count, it had a 24-hour Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">player peak</a> of over 30,000.

It’s the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth, allowing it a sub-3ms response time, and the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program. But since it’s been developed in collaboration with LG, the Wolverine V3 BT can only achieve that ultra-low latency when used with compatible LG TVs running webOS 25. It works as a universal Bluetooth gamepad with any device supporting Bluetooth controllers, including other TVs, but it won’t get ultra-low latency when doing so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>It looks a lot like a Wolverine V3 Pro, but with LG’s gaming logo on the power button and TV controls on the D-pad.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>As a TV-first controller, the new Wolverine V3 BT has some living room-friendly features like a built-in mic and TV controls on its D-pad. The new controller is similar to the standard Wolverine V3 Pro, but it lacks hair-trigger lockouts or extra shoulder buttons. Also, it’s got two customizable rear paddle buttons instead of the usual four. While some of that is a downgrade, this controller gets one big upgrade: TMR sticks. The Hall effect sticks on the Wolverine V3 Pro are already anti-drift, but the TMR ones of the V3 BT should be more precise and less power hungry.</p><p>Pricing and availability are not yet finalized for the Wolverine V3 BT.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

Playing a quick round of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, I got a nice sense of immersion as I could hear around me without needing to wear headphones. And the different kinds of weapons and character abilities made for varying styles of rumble and haptic sensations in my back and tush.</p><p>But you can’t actually see the lighting while playing, unless you take your eyes off the screen and crane your neck. I had to take my colleague at their word that the chair was lighting up and matching the keyboard and mouse Chroma RGB. Perhaps it’s streamer bait, but at least your head doesn’t block the lights like with Razer’s asinine <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-head-cushion-chroma" rel="sponsored">RGB cushion</a>.</p><p>Razer isn’t disclosing a potential price range for Project Madison, but it would likely sit toward the top of its priciest offerings if it ever actually comes out.

That doesn’t bode well for Project Madison unless Razer diehards are really clamoring for a chair with all these features built in — but at least they’re features people actually have a history of adopting in modular form.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <title><![CDATA[Viture’s latest AR glasses are as competitive and pricey as ever]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1398283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Smart glasses company Viture had a busy 2025, releasing its solid Luma series of glasses and ensuring that its pro mobile dock is compatible with Nintendo’s Switch 2. Now it’s kicking off 2026 by debuting a new model at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/836627/ces-2026-news-gadgets-announcements">CES</a>, called The Beast, and it’s available to preorder now for $549 with shipping starting in February.</p><p>The price is high for a company known for undercutting Xreal’s glasses with most (but not all) of the same features. In some ways, the price hike is warranted; Viture has caught up with Xreal as it has three degrees of freedom support built-in, letting you anchor your screen in virtual space, or allowing the screen to smoothly follow your head movements. Previous models have required additional hardware or software.</p><p>The Beast’s 58-degree field of view is also impressive since it’s a six-degree improvement over Viture’s previous flagship model (Xreal 1S supports 52 degrees). If you want more than just three dimming options, which is what most smart glasses have offered, the electrochromic tint that The Beast uses offers <em>nine</em> levels of adjustment. This lets you see as much or as little of your surrounding environment as you desire. It also has an embedded camera that will unlock six degrees of freedom in some use cases in the future.</p><p>Depending on the person, those benefits might make The Beast’s $100 premium price worth it compared to the cheaper 1S. They are certainly nice additions, even if they’re not must-have features for the average user.</p><p>One unfortunate omission in The Beast is myopia adjustments. Previous Viture models have dials above each eye’s display to let you make minor tweaks to get a clearer image. Instead, The Beast comes in two sizes (regular and large), but you may need prescription lenses if you’re nearsighted. I, for one, am nearsighted, but I was still able to achieve clear results with some adjustments to the included nose pads.</p><p>If you’re deciding between The Beast and the 1S (or any other AR glasses), here are some specs and thoughts worth knowing: Both support up to 1200p resolution (though Viture says it’s coming after launch) and 120Hz refresh rate. They both have 2D-to-3D conversion features that aim to make content more immersive, though my first impression wasn’t positive with either set. The Beast weigh about 96 grams according to my kitchen scale, while the 1S weighs in at 86 grams (Viture told <em>The Verge</em> that this preproduction unit weighs about two grams more than the final production version). The weight difference is easy to notice, and tweaking the fit of The Beast was all but necessary with its included nose pads. The Xreal 1S’ weight distribution feels more comfortable.</p><p>Anecdotally, I’ve preferred how my games and movies look through Viture’s glasses, even though both brands claim to utilize Sony’s latest micro OLED screens. Text and details appear sharp on The Beast and 1S, though the contrast is richer with Viture’s model. If those who own Viture’s Luma Pro glasses were content with the field of view and not being able to easily anchor the video feed in virtual space, I’m not convinced that these are worth upgrading to. And while Xreal doesn’t have the upper hand on this model in a meaningful way spec-wise, the lower price and weight of the 1S will probably make it the more popular pick.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I feel like I can’t even keep track of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>all the </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>teasers</span></a><span> anymore. Wasn’t one of these supposed to focus on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689"><span>Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom</span></a><span>? We’re now at the fourth out of the supposed four theater-exclusive trailers declaring that “so-and-so will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” and there’s no sign of the evil doctor yet. This fourth teaser, which is leaking online and also being taken down by Marvel almost immediately after, stars Shuri, the Black Panther, as she prepares the people of Wakanda for what’s to come, and they also meet a hero from another Earth: The Thing.</span></p> <p><span>Though the trailer is getting wiped off social media shortly after it’s been posted, we were able to see it before it got nuked. It opens with Shuri lamenting how she lost her family after the events of </span><i><span>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</span></i><span>, and we also see Namor and members of the underwater Talokan kingdom looking broodily in the distance at…something. But the real highlight is when Shuri and M’Baku greet none other than the Thing himself, Ben Grimm.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Thing and the rest of the Fantastic Four were shown arriving on the MCU’s version of Earth after the events of </span><i><span>Thunderbolts*</span></i><span>, and in </span><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i><span>’ post-credits scene, we saw Doctor Doom taking an interest in Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s god baby, Franklin. We’re not sure yet how that results in the group hopping multiverses, but it is cool to see even the first glimpse of the First Family teaming up with the rest of the MCU.</span></p>

 <p><span>The first three teasers featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491"><span>Steve Rogers</span></a><span>, the ex-Captain America who “retired” at the end of </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> and is now being dragged back into the scrap for probably deeply cynical, nostalgia-baiting reasons; Thor, who prays to his father that he will be able to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1clWprLC5Ak"><span>return to his daughter Love</span></a><span>; and the X-Men, who are also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-trailer-xmen-cyclops-charles-magneto-2000655923"><span>getting pulled into all this</span></a><span>. Again, no sign of Doctor Doom yet. Maybe there will be more teasers than initially believed? Or maybe we still have a while to wait for our first glimpse of RDJ as the ruler of Latveria.</span></p> <p><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>is coming to theaters on December 18.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-start="68" data-end="557">I have far too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, the mess of cables around my nightstand is starting to look like some kind of cyberpunk bird nest. It’s really my fault, though—I could easily fix this by getting a charging stand, like this Anker MagSafe charger, which would eliminate the chaos entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/"> Normally priced at $230, it’s now available for just $161 due to a limited-time 30% discount</a>. That’s a savings of $69 during the sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="559" data-end="588"><strong data-start="559" data-end="588">Perfect for Apple Devices</strong></h2>
<p data-start="590" data-end="882">This Anker MagSafe charging stand is designed specifically for modern Apple products. It’s made to work with newer iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watches that support wireless charging. The stand has three built-in wireless chargers, each designed for either your phone, watch, or AirPods case.</p>
<p data-start="884" data-end="1112">Before purchasing, make sure your devices are compatible with wireless charging. iPhones from the iPhone 12 onwards are all set, as are newer AirPods models. Older devices won’t work with this stand’s wireless charging features.</p>
<p data-start="1114" data-end="1587">What’s really impressive about this wireless charger is its speed. The stand can charge an iPhone 17 Pro to 50% in just 22 minutes, which is pretty fast for wireless charging. It provides 25W charging—better than most other wireless chargers in its class. You can leave your devices on the stand overnight, and they’ll be fully charged by morning. Alternatively, you can keep the stand at your desk while you work.</p>


<p data-start="1589" data-end="1817">The stand also features a display that shows the charging status of your devices and even a clock, making it a great addition to your nightstand. This allows you to easily check the time without lifting your head off the pillow.</p>
<p data-start="1819" data-end="2069">As with all Anker products, safety is a top priority. The MagSafe charging stand uses ActiveShield technology, which monitors temperatures over three million times per day to ensure your devices don’t overheat while charging, keeping everything safe.</p>
<p data-start="2071" data-end="2223">With the Anker MagSafe charging stand, you can clean up your nightstand and keep your devices charged without the mess of cables, all for a great price. There are two color options available. Choose either white or phantom gray. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. It is exactly $0.01 cheaper. But then again, pennies are no longer a thing anymore so I guess they are exactly the same. Get it now for $160.99 or $160.98 for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">That’s down from a starting price of $230, meaning you end up saving $69—equivalent to 30% off.</a></p>

		<p>It’s already 2026? So that means it’s time for a new year of fresh new games, and a whole 12 months of lusting after the next big thing? Let’s get started then! One of the first big things for the year has to be Romeo Is A Dead Man, a hyper-kinetic, hyper-violent, hyper-insane new action title from the iconic Grasshopper Manufacture. This has already hopped onto a bunch of the TSA team’s radar, and this new story trailer gives you the lowdown in a typically Grasshopper-like way, which means it’s irreverent, weird and darkly funny. Go take a look!</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Story Introduction Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ストーリー紹介編トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EryjLSG0x_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, I’m not too sure what the moral of this story is going to be. Don’t pick up women in the road? Don’t fall in love? Don’t let your grandfather shove technology down your eyeball that turns you into some sort of living-dead superhero? I’m not entirely sure whether SUDA51 and his team are in the habit of including morals or finger-wagging in their games, so I’m going to take it that the moral is going to be something about being faster, meaner and more violent than the bad guys, so you don’t end up being a doubly dead man. </p>
<p>Romeo Stargazer, a sheriff’s deputy, is the hero of this piece, but he doesn’t stay human for all that long by the look of things. He finds Juliet – because of course he does – in the middle of the road, and they fall in love. I’m hoping that there’s more Shakespearean asides for the English Lit fans in the back too, as the rest of the trailer opts instead to tell you about how Romeo dies at the hands of a White Devil, and how his grandfather, Professor Benjamin, saves him. Surely he should be Professor Montague? I suppose Benjamin is close enough to Benvolio. Just about.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s clear that the tone of Romeo Is A Dead Man is going to be all kinds of tongue-in-cheek and all kinds of raucous fun, as your living-dead hero takes his revenge on a series of creepy monsters.  </p>

<p>Romeo is a Dead Man releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam and Windows platforms) on February 11th, 2026.</p>
<p>You can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/romeo-is-a-dead-man/9MXHH4JL4G76/0010">Xbox</a> right now!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creepy Jar’s newest survival game StarRupture has launched into Steam Early Access today, with a launch discount price of $15.99 / €15,99 / £13.59 / 51,99 zl, giving players the opportunity to survive and thrive on a hostile alien planet. Alongside the launch of StarRupture, Creepy Jar has shared a general early access roadmap of what players should expect over the next few months and further on.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQywin8d2U8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ongoing improvements players should expect in StarRupture’s Early Access include the game’s performance, the building mechanics, the combat mechanics, the game world, and the user interface. Additional features will be more wildlife, custom game mode options with adjustable difficulty, a new travel mode to go between bases, a codex, controller support, new building features, new combat mechanics, and new ways to explore the world. New content that will be added in StarRupture will include new weapons, an expanded map, more corporation levels and associated rewards, new buildings, new resources, new locations and points of interest, new story elements, and a new forgotten engine. Creepy Jar will also be looking to balance the co-op gameplay, improve the cargo network, add accessibility options such as text size and better key rebinding, and dedicated servers. When StarRupture eventually releases into version 1.0 it will get a new biome, something called frost wave, the end game content, more story elements, and achievements. There is no specific timeline for any of this yet.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

			<p>Goichi <strong>"Suda51"</strong> and <strong>Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> require no introduction, as they have developed some of the quirkiest games ever released on PC and consoles. After working on new entries in the <em>No More Heroes</em> series and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/"><strong>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</strong></a></em>, the legendary game designer and his studio began working on <strong>Romeo is a Dead Man</strong>, their <strong>first IP in a very long time</strong>, which looked like a Suda51 game through and through, even <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture-studio-reveals-romeo-is-a-dead-man-coming-to-ps5-in-2026/">in its announcement trailer.</a></strong></p>



<p>The game's unmistakable feel was also evident in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/"><strong>short demo I was able to check out during Gamescom 2025</strong></a>, with intense action and an overall artistic direction that I have found close to <strong>Quentin Tarantino's style</strong>, something I told Suda51 himself when I had the chance to speak with him about <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em>.</p>



<p>Besides saying that he <span>is often told this,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank"><strong>Suda51 also discussed</strong></a></span><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> how the game's story and setting were heavily inspired by Back to the Future and FBI TV shows.</strong></a> I couldn't see much of this influence in the Gamescom demo, but after playing through the game's first two chapters in a more relaxed setting, these influences are difficult to ignore. It is difficult not to notice how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> has the potential to become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the best games ever made</strong> by the Japanese development studio.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Romeo-is-a-Dead-Man-Preview-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Romeo is a Dead Man's story can get weird at times, but it's surprisingly engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Suda51, "Romeo is a Dead Man" was inspired by a <strong>"what if" scenario from Back to the Future: what if Marty McFly died?</strong> What would have Doc Emmett Brown done? He would have gone back in time and saved Marty. And this is precisely what <strong>Benjamin Stargazer</strong> does to save his nephew Romeo, returning to the moment he was going to be killed by a mysterious creature, fitting him with the <strong>Dead Gear Life Support System</strong> to save his life.</p>



<p>This, however, creates a <strong>Time Paradox</strong> which shatters the space-time continuum, transforming reality into a <strong>chaotic multiverse</strong>. To restore the world, the <strong>FBI Space-Time Division</strong> recruits Romeo, who becomes an agent under the name of <strong>DeadMan</strong>. Traveling through space-time, Romeo will not only pursue some heinous space-time criminals, but also seek his girlfriend, <strong>Juliet</strong>, who appears to be connected to the major crisis that has disrupted the entire universe.</p>



<p>If this premise sounds a little confusing to you, you are not alone. In its first two story chapters, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> feels like a mish-mash of very diverse concepts, where the aforementioned influences are blended with a gameplay formula that's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">markedly Suda51</strong>. The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hack-and-slash</strong> experience is fairly straightforward, combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">melee and gun combat</strong> in a simple yet effective way, enriching both with unique mechanics such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloody Summer</strong> - an all-powerful attack that can be unleashed once enough blood has been gathered - <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Bastards</strong> - special skills unleashed by friendly enemies with a lot of different offensive and support effects - and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">shoot weak points</strong> on certain enemies to deal massive damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210180216_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Boss fights in Romeo is a Dead Man are set to be one of the highlights of the experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the game's very first chapter is essentially the entirety of the Gamescom 2025 demo set in a swamp area ending with a boss fight against one of the many <strong>versions of Juliet</strong> roaming space time, it's the <strong>second chapter</strong> that proved to be the most surprising, to me. Following some story sequences aboard <strong>The Last Night</strong> ship, which serves as the central hub, rendered with a <strong>top-down view and 16-bit visuals</strong>, Romeo is sent to his baptism of fire in an <strong>abandoned mall</strong> to seek out a space-time fugitive who has been wreaking havoc across time.</p>



<p>It's in this mall that the very diverse ideas behind <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> started coming together. While the <strong>Dead Rising inspiration</strong> was evident throughout the stage, fighting zombie-like enemies using newly unlocked weapons like the <strong>fists and heavy sword weapons</strong>, unleashing Bloody Summer to restore health in a bind, and jumping between real space and <strong>Subspace</strong>, an alternate dimension accessed by using an <strong>old TV set</strong> showing a mysterious individual making almost nonsensical philosophical commentary, to reach power generators scattered all over the place is quite fun, thanks to a somewhat <strong>intricate level design</strong> that makes it easy to look past the relative linearity of the game's world. As is the battle against the space-time criminal, who turns into the massive <strong>Enhanced Phantom</strong> whose diverse moveset puts Romeo's battle skills to the test, forcing him to move between <strong>two different floors</strong> to avoid powerful area-of-effect electric attacks.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210181909_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The shifting art style is one of the features that defines Romeo is a Dead Man</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As highlighted by the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Back to the Future</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dead Rising</em> inspirations, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> often feels like a <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">celebration of entertainmen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> media as a whole</strong>. The references are scattered everywhere, even in Romeo's progression systems, which include a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">minigame that plays like a classic labyrinth arcade game</strong> from the 80s to increase his stats, and a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pong-like minigame</strong> that must be completed to pinpoint the next space-time anomaly, and thus criminal to take down. All of this does make the experience feel a little messy, but it's undeniable that it also gives <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">certain charm</strong> that is too often missing in modern AAA video games.</p>

<p>With the game's first two chapters being so markedly different from one another, I really can't wait to see what else <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> has in store, and if the quality on display in the first hour or so of the game will hold up for the rest of the experience. If it does, I am confident the game has the potential of becoming <strong>one of the best games ever made by Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> when it launches on <strong>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/"><strong>February 11</strong>.</a></p>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> takes a lot of bold swings in its narrative. Every subsequent act reframes the previous, expanding your perspective of the world and its characters. What awaits at the end is a tragic choice that only the player can make—and there's convincing arguments on both sides.</p><p>From the first hour, it's clear that this game is operating on a different caliber. This world has operated with its own natural laws for years, and you're just trying to catch up and learn. The expeditions and their exploits show the desperation and ingenuity of the people of Lumiere, and their stories are just as compelling as the interpersonal drama that takes centerstage in act 3.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur </em>also does something few games do: The protagonist makes his own choices without any input from the player. In fact, the player doesn't have insights into his thought process either. It makes him feel more alive and like a real character rather than an avatar you're trying to min-max for the most optimal party.</p><p>For all its fantasy elements and weird paintbrush monsters, the game highlights simple, universal emotions and themes anyone can relate to. Grief, escapism, trauma responses, sibling rivalry—it's all there, brought to life in harrowing scenarios with simple but effective metaphors.</p><p>To this day, people debate which ending is the "correct" one, but the truth of the matter is, both are valid. The narrative tells such a human story, and like most tragic human stories, they're complicated. It just depends on your own perspective, and that perspective may change over time.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>We love tablets for the convenience they bring. You can enjoy your favorite shows on a spacious screen, catch up with work on the go, and even keep kids entertained (for a while, at least) with cartoons or games without handing over your phone. There’s no shortage of options on the market, and if you’re after an iPad, we just found a way to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">The 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is currently sitting at $300 at Amazon, after a sweet $49 discount.</a> We know, it’s not the biggest price drop out there, but considering Apple products rarely go on sale, grabbing a top-rated iPad for less still feels like a win. The discount applies to blue, silver, and pink models, so there are options to choose from. Maybe go for the classic silver version if you like your gadgets minimal, or choose the stunning pink if you’re after something with a bit more personality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast and Efficient</h2>
<p>This iPad flaunts a gorgeous, 11-inch Liquid Retina display. It’s both spacious and bright, plus it features True Tone technology that can automatically adjust according to the color temperature of the room for a comfortable viewing experience. Walk into a dim room, and it will reduce the brightness to reduce eye strain, and similarly, push it back up when you’re using the tablet outdoors. Right above the screen is a 12MP Center Stage front camera, which makes taking selfies and hopping on video calls a breeze. It keeps your center of focus while delivering impressive picture quality that helps you look your best. The front camera is paired with a 12MP Wide back camera with True Tone flash that is just as great for capturing moments, and even taking 4K videos or scanning documents.</p>
<p>The superfast A16 chip keeps things running smoothly, whether you’re trying to work on a creative project or take notes. iPadOS takes the experience even further by letting you navigate with ease. It even comes packed with essential apps like Safari, Messages, and Keynote to help you get started with work or play right away. This version gets you 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to house a ton of photos, all your important programs, and even a few movies, without feeling limited. However, if 128GB feels insufficient, there are 256GB and 512GB versions of the iPad available, too, for $399 and $590, respectively.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to use this iPad for work or creative projects, we highly recommend pairing it with the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the Magic Keyboard Folio. The former lets you draw, sketch, and take notes with ease. The latter, on the other hand, features a two-piece design with a detachable keyboard and a protective back panel. Both of these attach magnetically to the screen, converting your iPad into a mini laptop. As for connectivity, this version supports Wi-Fi 6 to access the internet.</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last an entire workday on a single charge. You won’t have to worry about plugging it in in the middle of something important.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">The current 14% discount brings the price down to $300.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, but if you’re after something that can support all your work and entertainment needs on the go, it’s going to be worth it. Snap it up before the deal expires or the stock runs out!</p>

<p>Coming to the tech talk, Resident Evil Requiem has been optimised for a wide range of PCs ahead of its release, featuring path-traced effects, DLSS 4, accelerated performance, and enhanced image quality. Thanks to path tracing, the game will be able to render multiple shadows from multiple light sources, along with complex lighting effects such as reflections and refractions through glass.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game will also be available on GeForce Now at launch, allowing players to access the power of a GeForce RTX 5080 with DLSS 4 enabled. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/woojer-strap-4-review-rumble-pack/</link>
            <guid>1398184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gamers are always looking for the next level. A bigger sword, a more powerful gun, magic that turns your foes into globs of pink mush. But what about levelling up your gaming setup? A headset would always be my first call, and then maybe a pro controller or high end mouse, but what then?</p>
<p>Woojer have their own ideas on that, and they’ve been toting their haptic-infused devices for several years. While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/woojer-vest-3-review/">Woojer Vest</a> – now on its fourth generation – is the headline grabber, the Woojer Strap is the more accessible option, giving gamers and music lovers an extra layer of immersion by strapping a single device to your body, its haptics shocking, rumbling and thumping in time with the action.</p>



<p>Priced at £124 – with a healthy holiday season discount down to £95 – the Woojer Strap 4 is the latest iteration of the single-unit device. In the box, you’re getting the Woojer Strap 4 central unit, an elasticated strap to wrap around your body, a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, and a double-ended 3.5mm cable to physically connect your audio devices.</p>
<p>As gaming devices go, the Strap 4 is pretty straightforward. The unit itself has some weight to it and feels incredibly robust in your hand, crafted from solid plastic throughout, and available in a series of different colours. To the front, there’s a customisable LED ring with rubberised physical volume and intensity controls within it.</p>

<p>The top edge features the power button and Bluetooth pairing button, while the bottom includes a USB-C charging port and two 3.5mm audio sockets, one for input and the other as a dedicated output. I thought the older model’s copper finish looked great, but the addition of RGB allows the Strap 4 to match your gaming setup, and the extra layer of customisation gives you some individuality too. If you’re not an RGB fan? You can just turn it all off.</p>

<p>You’ll need a mobile device for the Strap 4 setup, and it proves pleasingly simple to connect the device to the Woojer app, where it takes you through pairing to your device, and then the secondary pairing of your headphones to the Strap 4. This all worked first time, which almost never happens, and you then find yourself with the main control page, which gives you an input and output display, as well as power remaining and the current latency setting, which you can alter if you find that the Strap 4’s haptic output doesn’t quite match up with whatever visuals you’re looking at.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can directly control the volume and the intensity, though there’s physical buttons for these as well, and, if needed, you can dive into the haptic sensation mode, which alters the behaviour of the haptics through Broad, Focused and Gaming settings.</p>
<p>The app also gives you decent control over the LED lights. There’s a full spectrum colour wheel to dial in the exact tone you want, adjust the brightness, and choose between a series of different effects to keep things interesting. While you’re playing, it’s not exactly something that adds all that much to the experience, but it’s certainly more futuristic, and if you’re out and about listening to music, you’ll certainly turn a few heads.</p>
<p>The Strap 4 experience is definitely easier to get into than the Woojer Vest. It’s small and portable, doesn’t take up much space, and requires minimal setup. You can just throw it on, and start watching, playing or listening to whatever you want, and I really liked how simple it felt. In turn, it immediately lifts your experience, with the added haptic feedback from your audio immersing you deeper in your content than ever before.</p>

<p>You can wear it in a variety of ways, though Woojer seem to recommend particular setups for particular input types, so for music you’d wear it around your waist, or horizontally while playing VR . Fundamentally, you can go for whatever feels best and most natural to you, and I gravitated most towards wearing it across my body, with the strap over one shoulder and the unit in the centre of my chest. This makes the haptic sensation fire directly into your chest, and explosions and heavy hits thump and rumble straight into you. Just like the rumble motors in a controller, it brings the action to life that bit further, and I find it hard to go back to playing without the extra layer it provides.</p>
<p>I loved using the Strap 4 for regular flat-screen gaming, listening to music and rewatching the most recent Star Trek movies, but VR is where it truly makes a major difference. With your senses cut off from the outside world, the rumble feels more nuanced and powerful, and whether you’re playing Beat Saber and throwing yourself directly into the music, or going for something more action-heavy like the new Deadpool VR, the Strap 4 brings a new level of immersion for a relatively low entry price.</p>
<p>While it can’t compare to the full experience you feel with the Woojer Vest, in terms of value for money, I think the Strap 4 hits the sweet spot between what it brings to your experience and the asking price. If you’ve already got a great headset, a pro controller, and a VR setup, the Strap 4 is practically a no-brainer as the next step in your gaming setup.</p>

<p>The only limitation, and this goes for all Woojer devices, is that this is a physical representation of audio output. That means your experience relies on how the audio is delivered, getting the levels right, and it will change on a game-by-game or song-by-song basis. It means there’s a certain degree of variation and inconsistency that some users might find disappointing, and hopefully Woojer can find a way to tap into the rumble and gamepad haptic signals in future. Once you’ve become accustomed to that abstraction, though, I still don’t think you’ll look back.</p>
