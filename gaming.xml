<p>Amazing Seasun Games has announced that the Mecha BREAK Beta is now available on the Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>The announcement comes following the Beta launch on Steam last week, which saw the game become the most played demo on the platform with over 317,000 concurrent players. </p>



<p>As tweeted on X (formerly Twitter), Amazing Seasun Games will be rewarding Xbox players for their patience with 2000 Corite credits. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Greetings Pilots! We’re happy to announce the Xbox build of our Open Beta Test is now LIVE!

To thank you for your patience, we will be giving each Xbox player 2000 Corite so you can jump right into the action.</span></p></article></div>



<p>What’s particularly interesting though, is despite the game being scheduled to release on PC, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 5, a beta for the PS5 is yet to be announced.</p>



<p>When one user asked when will the PlayStation Beta come, the official account replied, “We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation later this year.”</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on why the game has yet to announce a PlayStation 5 Beta, but Insider Gaming has asked Amazing Seasun Games for comment.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the the Mecha BREAK Beta has yet to be given an end date either.</p>



<p>Will you be playing the Mecha BREAK Beta? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>During its developer livestream on March 4, Bungie announced a brand-new, limited-time PvP mode called Heavy Metal coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>in Heresy Act 3.</p><p>While details were limited, we did get to see some gameplay that shows teams of players sorted into Drake Tank drivers or Brig pilots. Guardians haven't been able to control Brigs before, despite them being in the game for more than half a decade. While we've had access to Drake Tanks before, they now have new functionality including rocket-boosted backflips.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453912-destiny-2-heavy-metal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453912-destiny-2-heavy-metal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453912"></a><figcaption>Heavy Metal is a 6v6 vehicle combat mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453912-destiny-2-heavy-metal.jpg"></figure><p>The 6v6 vehicle combat activity is only going to be in the game for a limited time. Bungie hinted that, if the reception is positive, Heavy Metal could be added to the Crucible rotation, much like the chaotic Mayhem mode, which features near-zero ability cooldowns.</p><p>Bungie wants players to find the mode "goofy and fun" and challenged Guardians to jump in a Drake Tank to perform a 360 no-scope.</p><p>There's no official release date for the Heavy Metal PvP mode, but it has been confirmed to be releasing at some point within Heresy Act 3, which releases on April 1.</p><p>Other announcements during the livestream include the arrival of a limited-time dungeon-focused event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-rite-of-the-nine-event-is-for-dungeon-newcomers-and-veterans-alike/1100-6529863/" data-ref-id="1100-6529863">Rite of the Nine</a>, as well as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-io-planet-is-coming-out-of-the-vault-next-week-for-a-new-roguelike-inspired-activity/1100-6529860/" data-ref-id="1100-6529860"> return of Io</a>.</p>

                <p>Bungie has announced the upcoming arrival of Rite of the Nine, a limited-time Destiny 2 event centered around three of the space shooter's dungeons.</p><p>The dungeons featured will be Prophecy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-spire-of-the-watcher-dungeon-guide/1100-6509966/" data-ref-id="1100-6509966">Spire of the Watcher</a>, and Ghosts of the Deep. They'll rotate weekly throughout the event's duration. Three modes - Ultimatum, Explorer, and Eternity, will affect the way players experience each dungeon. Players will be working towards a high score, and that score is calculated on how often you die. Stay alive as much as possible, and your score will be higher. That score will determine how good the loot drop is at the completion of each encounter. "We're challenging you to go into this harder mode and not just execute, but execute in a way that gets you a higher score, better rolls, and in the Ultimatum mode, Adept versions," Bungie explained.</p><p>Ultimatum mode is for players who are experienced in running dungeons looking for an extra challenge. Ultimatum mode will bump the power level to be equivalent with the game's most difficult content as seen in the likes of Contest mode. Each dungeon will have activity modifiers added which will craft the experience, or make it more challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453899-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453899" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453899-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453899"></a><figcaption>Rite of the Nine entrance</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453899-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Bungie's aim here is to require Guardians to make decisions before entering a dungeon or starting an encounter. For example, the Not Swap mod means you'll need to keep one Exotic equipped for the duration of the encounter without changing it. "We need you to really focus on figuring out this encounter and how you're going to tackle the challenges associated with it," Bungie said.</p><p>Explorer mode has been created for players who may not have ever played a dungeon before. They'll be tuned so that Guardians can go in, learn the mechanics, and gain experience. It gives players the opportunity to take their time and figure it out. To accommodate this, Bungie has added in-world tooltips that describe the dungeon mechanics, as well as markers for the moments where a route might be less obvious. Alongside this, there will be reduced Darkness phases, and the revive timer will be just five seconds long. Bungie wants to remove the penalty for failure and encourage players to learn these dungeons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453900-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453900" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453900-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453900"></a><figcaption>Adept weapons in Rite of the Nine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453900-destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine.png"></figure><p>In the event's launch space, Guardians will meet the Emissary, who serves as the event vendor. The Emissary will offer quests, bounties, and rewards throughout the event. Four weapons from each dungeon can be earned. These weapons have reworked perk pools, as well as new perks. Similarly to the Into the Light event, Guardians can attune themselves to specific weapons if they're looking for a particular roll.</p><p>Ultimatum mode is the only mode which will drop Adept versions of the dungeons' weapons, which have new treatment. Not only do Adept weapons roll with additional perks, but they have a visual makeover too. An animated holofoil pattern shines across the weapons, and Nine iconography is engraved into them.</p><p>As well as the Adept weapons, a new event-exclusive Origin Perk called Gravity Well will drop on all weapons during the event. While Bungie didn't tell us exactly what Gravity Well does, it did disclose that players will only be able to get weapons with this Origin Perk during the Rite of the Nine event.</p>

            <p>
Dead by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deadlight">Deadlight</a> is waving goodbye to a horror icon. Developer Behaviour Interactive has announced Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - is being yanked from sale on 4th April. 
</p>
<p>
Pinhead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-teasing-hellraiser-additions-removing-stranger-things-dlc-in-november">joined the Dead by Daylight roster</a> back in September 2021, following in the footsteps of other legends of horror including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface.
</p>
<p>
As Hellraiser might have it though, where there's pleasure, there's also pain, and Pinhead - AKA The Cenobite - is shuffling back to his corner of Hell early next month, taking his fancy box of torment with him. As <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/hellraiser-last-chance-sale/">explained in Behaviour's announcement</a>, however, he's only retreating from digital store fronts - existing owners can continue playing with old needle-bonce after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC will be possible.

<p>
If that news has suddenly spurred you into a last-minute FOMO purchase, it's additionally worth noting the Hellraiser DLC is being removed from first-party digital stores from today, 4th March (with the exception of Switch's eShop, which says goodbye to Pinhead on 18th March), but it'll still be available to purchase via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>'s in-game store until 4pm GMT on 4th April. And to encourage a few final purchases ahead of the Hellraiser Chapter's removal, Behaviour is discounting The Cenobite and his Cosmetics by 50 precent in Dead by Daylight's store.

Behaviour hasn't explained <em>why</em> the DLC is being removed from sale (its <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/493-faq-the-hellraiser-content">official FAQ</a> goes with the line, "As with all Live-Service Games frequent updates and additions are to be expected"), but the answer is almost certainly licensing-related. Dead by Daylights's Stranger Things DLC was similarly withdrawn in 2019, although that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-returns-to-dead-by-daylight">did eventually return</a>, implying Pinhead could also be back - if only Behaviour's legal team can solve that pesky Lament Configuration.

The February flood picks up into a tidal wave in March with dozens of new games both big and small to check out, as well as tons more that will blow up or be discovered in the weeks ahead. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is the big tentpole blockbuster this month, but there’s plenty more I can’t wait to check out on either side of the recently delayed open-world RPG’s release. </p><p>2024 lowkey surivival horror hit <em>Sorry We’re Closed</em> finally makes the jump to console this month, while <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em>, last year’s Game Pass mashup of <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Persona</em>, finally hits PlayStation 5 in March with some bonus features. I’m also really looking forward to strategy city builder <em>Cataclismo</em> coming out of Early Access with its 1.0 launch on Steam. It was one of the best things I played last year. Here are 24 other game releases and platform ports we can’t wait to check out this month. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> World’s Edge, Forgotten Empires</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Xbox Game Studios </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5 </p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Gameloft</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Gameloft</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Groundshatter </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Raw Fury </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Two Point Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Sega</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Chris Nordgren, Jordi Roca</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Foreign Gnomes</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Bad Guitar Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Bad Guitar Studio</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Stardust</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Stardust</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Hazelight Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Electronic Arts</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Konami</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Konami</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> ThunderFox Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> ThunderFox Studio</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Koei Tecmo</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Koei Tecmo</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> IvyRoad</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Annapurna Interactive</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> ALPHAWING Inc.</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Playism </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Visual Concepts </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> San Diego Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Sony</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Studio Fizbin</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Thunderful Publishing </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Ubisoft</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Ubisoft </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S,  PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Monolith Soft</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Nintendo</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tamsoft Corporation </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Bandai Namco </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tripwire Interactive</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Tripwire Interactive</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Rebellion</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Rebellion</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Neople</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Nexon</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> inZOI Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Krafton</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Red Soul Games</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Raw Fury</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, PC</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whether you need to tune up your catch-as-catch-can holds or work on throwing meaner right hooks than Logan Paul, 2K offering WWE 2K25 Early Access would have many ready, willing, and Gable to buy.</p>



<p>2K’s multimedia sports game empire is a winner every year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> is the natural successor to WWE 2K24, and is looking to be the Apex Predator of the group. More and more games offer Early Access, and WWE 2K25 is a natural fit for the incentive.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> already has it, so I’m here to tell you if you can expect it from WWE 2K25.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-wwe-2k25-early-access">Can You Play WWE 2K25 Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Intergender wrestling is a big move. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 offers 7-Day Early Access as a bonus for those who pre-order the Deadman</strong> <strong>Edition and Bloodline Editions.</strong></p>



<p>WWE 2K25’s Early Access is a chance to get stuck into MyGM, Universe Mode, and explore The Island as an early adopter. You can learn the new mechanics, get an Edge (pun intended) on other newbies, and become the King or Queen of the Ring.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-wwe-2k25-early-access">How to Play WWE 2K25 Early Access</h2>



<p>Three editions await those who want to secure their copy before launch: The Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and Bloodline Edition. The final two are the key for Early Access. Pre-order the Deadman or Bloodline Edition for a seven-day headstart over the competition.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick guide on how to secure this big bonus:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25’s website</a>.</li>



<li>Click on <strong>pre-order now</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll down <strong>and choose either the Deadman or Bloodline Edition</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose your platform.</li>



<li>Press <strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;to go to the storefront you desire.</li>



<li>Again, choose the newer&nbsp;<strong>pre-order now</strong>&nbsp;button.</li>



<li>Purchase the edition and confirm it.</li>



<li>You can download and play Early Access when it begins.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-when-does-wwe-2k25-early-access-start">When Does WWE 2K25 Early Access Start?</h2>



<p><strong>Early Access for WWE 2K25 begins on March 7, giving you seven full days to enjoy WWE 2K25 before it launches worldwide on March 14.</strong></p>



<p>If you think I’m telling an Eddie Guerrero-sized lie, I promise I haven’t cheated you, and I’ll steal the official confirmation from 2K itself. On the official <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/37145831078163--WWE-2K25-Pre-Order-and-Edition-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 FAQ</a>, it says: “Standard Editions can start their throw-down journey on March 14, and the early access for pre-orders of Deadman and The Bloodline Editions will get access starting March 7.”</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you prepared to pay a bit more and secure your ticket to the dance? Or will you turn down the offer and take the brunt of a John Cena heel turn?</p>



<p>It’s not exactly from the dirt sheets, but many other WWE 2K25 details are known. This year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-showcase-mode-matches-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Showcase Matches</a> are announced, and we know all about 2K25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-wwe-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> eligibility.</p>

Along with the usual four face buttons on the right side of the control, you’ll find two additional face buttons as R1 and R2. All six face buttons utilize microswitches, which Hori states were used to increase the accuracy and durability of the inputs.</p><p>Even with R1 and R2 moving to the front of the controller, the Octa Pro still has four tactile shoulder buttons. You can also map inputs to the pair of remappable back buttons.</p><p>The 8-gate analog stick was designed with fighting games in mind, so diagonal inputs should be easier to execute on the Octa Pro compared to a standard controller. Inside the box, you'll find three hot-swappable D-pad designs. Hori also added a low-profile "analog slide pad" that resembles the Switch's Circle Pad. The slide pad is meant to be used in menu systems.</p><p>The controller is wireless, though it does include a USB-C cable for charging and wired play. It comes with a cable lock to mitigate the risk of a disconnection during a match. Hori says the the controller can run for roughly 10 hours between charges. In addition to the USB-C port, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You’ll find a cable lock feature on the back of the gamepad--so you can lock the cable in place to ensure it doesn’t disconnect during the heat of battle. Expect to get around 10 hours of game time per charge. While the Octa Pro is technically compatible with PS4, it can only be used in wired mode on PlayStation's last-gen console.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, a more affordable variation of the controller is already available--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-PlayStation-Fighting-Commander-OCTA-5/dp/B09RQTTWPQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Commander Octa</a>. It’s not quite as robust as the upcoming Pro model, but this $59 wired controller still features an 8-way analog stick, six face buttons, and support for PS5, PS4, and PC. </p><p>Beyond the Commander Octa lineup, we've rounded up a handful of other fightpads and traditional fight sticks that are worth checking out if you're looking for a dedicated option for your favorite fighting games. </p><h2>More Fightpads and Fight Sticks to Consider</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PDP-Victrix-Wireless-Controller-Playstation-5/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PDP Victrix Pro BFG Wireless Controller (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $175</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-PlayStation-Fighting-Stick-Alpha-5/dp/B09RQV4786?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Stick Alpha (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $172 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Fighting-Stick-Alpha-TEKKEN-5/dp/B0CJ9QMHWD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Stick Alpha: Tekken Edition (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $172 (<del>$230</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Fighting-Stick-Mini-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CKB9WK3F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori Fighting Stick Mini (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $52 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kitsune All-Button Arcade Controller (PS5, PC)</a> -- $294</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKT21XWR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro Leverless Fight Stick (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $250</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQKGHW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS-12 All-Button (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $384</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3VQXXJR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro FS (PS5, PS4, PC)</a> -- $380 (<del>$400</del>)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4453705-mixcollage-04-mar-2025-09-23-am-6577.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453705" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4453705-mixcollage-04-mar-2025-09-23-am-6577.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453705"></a><figcaption>Hori Wireless Fighting Commander Octa Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4453705-mixcollage-04-mar-2025-09-23-am-6577.jpg"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched in February to critical acclaim and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">more than 2 million in sales</a>, but the game debuted with no ability to give your character, Henry, a look of your own choosing. That's set to change soon, as developer Warhorse has announced that Barber Mode is coming to the RPG in mid-March, and it'll allow players to change their hair and beard style. This mode was first announced in January when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Warhorse revealed the game's post-launch content roadmap.</a></p><p>This was announced as part of a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2392565307" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch livestream</a>, during which Warhorse showed off the new beard and hair styles. Reddit user Valmont_DE captured some images from the stream, which show off how players will be able to customize Henry's look when the update arrives.</p><p>As you can see, the Barber mode will allow players to customize Henry's hair and facial hair, and there are plenty of options to choose from to help make him look how you want.</p><p>The developer livestream also dug into new details around Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">Hardcore mode</a>, which Warhorse said is a "more difficult and immersive way" of playing the RPG, <a href="https://gamerant.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hair-beard-styles-revealed-barber-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant reported</a>. In Hardcore mode, some helpful UI elements will be limited in and out of combat, while your player's location is never shown on the map, so you have to find a way on your own. Additionally, fast travel is disabled, and players can choose "negative perks" to make the game harder.</p><p>Following these free updates, Warhorse will release new story expansions for Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance through the game's paid expansion pass. These story expansions include Brushes with Death in Summer 2025 and Legacy of the Forge in Fall 2025. A third expansion, Mysteria Ecclesia, is set for release in Winter 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/merchants-of-rosewall-review-shop-management-visual-novel-with-twist</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/merchants-of-rosewall-review-shop-management-visual-novel-with-twist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Big Blue Sky Games' first title, <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em>, is a blend between a visual novel and store manager with a unique take on crafting. It’s an impressive first outing for the indie studio. Not only is there a complete and well-thought-out storyline along with the distinct management mechanics, but there are multiple NPCs and a cozy art style to go with it.</p>

<h2>Stock the Shelves in <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> Shop Simulation</h2>

<p>The story begins with you arriving in Rosewall. You’re part of a merchant program that aims to strengthen relations between the Estoiq Trading Company (ETC) and the city. You’re in charge of a shop, though the ETC owns it and the land the building is on. Maintaining your merchant status comes at a cost, with strict requirements set by the program.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-tailor-companion.jpg?itok=aVWq8TPa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-tailor-companion.jpg?itok=QiUZiruT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the shop management part of <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> comes in. To get inventory, you need to hire members of the various crafting guilds. Cooks, masons, smiths, artists, tailors, and woodworkers are all waiting to be hired, though not at the same time. As you work through the first couple months of the game you’ll get letters announcing when someone is available to join you.</p>

<p>Companions specialize in a certain craft and rank from S to E. The higher the rank, the more they can produce. Not only that, but the chance of creating extra merchandise or being able to craft another set of items for the day increases. This can come into play if you have, for example, too many artists and not enough tailors to fabricate the products you want on the day you need. You can assign one of the artists to the Tailor workshop by looking at the rankings and selecting the best candidate for the job.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-companion-menu.jpg?itok=NsRmSkoS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-companion-menu.jpg?itok=Ld9U0hQ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The different crafting specialties are all related to each other, especially as the recipes become more complex later in the game. A smith may make regular steins, while multiple cooks craft some ale, and a woodcutter puts on the final touches to a set of Ornate Steins. Some of the best items to create are the ones that take a variety of companions to produce.</p>

<p>I really loved this interconnectedness. Not only is it more realistic, but it can make things especially difficult to create. It’s a new challenge that evolves with the game, requiring more to make an expensive item then just pricey materials. It also means that not every employee will produce a unique item to go on the shelf. With sales goals in mind, this can be the difference between failure and continuing on.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-crafting-smith-workshop.jpg?itok=SLwPVmgO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-crafting-smith-workshop.jpg?itok=aYKdoaNH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Companions don’t only craft inventory, but they act as your salespeople, stockers, and greeters. These store skills are ranked the same way as crafting skills, impacting how much you can bump prices, bring in customers, and keep merchandise on the shelves. The likelihood that any companion is idle during a day at the shop is rare.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Delve into Rosewall History</h2>

<p>Woven between daily crafting is the narrative of <em>Merchants of Rosewall.</em> Styled like a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a8cd461c-31ce-4af9-b6d2-6a804d37d2a0" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/visual-novel" rel="nofollow">visual novel</a>, you accidentally swallow a bit of elemental energy known as a Memory, and stumble onto a mystery that could impact how Rosewall currently functions.&nbsp;Most of the NPC interactions and world exploration take place during these story moments.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-seagull.jpg?itok=cXv5qQ5J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-seagull.jpg?itok=w8XuMdEf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Choices made during dialogue exchanges don’t necessarily matter as the story progresses in a linear fashion. You’ll often find yourself going through all the available options before being able to move on. That’s simply because there are multiple pieces of the puzzle that have to be explored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing the narrative elements taken seriously and not as a quick addition to create breaks to the shop keeping made me quite excited. It’s not a straightforward story with little thought put into it. There are even plot twists that took me by surprise, which I really enjoyed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Bugs</h2>

<p>While the game operates smoothly, for the most part, there are some issues with it. First is the biggest one, a failure to mark a quest step as complete when the required Renown level is reached. This blocks progression, causing you to fail, ending your journey in Rosewall.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-critical-bug.jpg?itok=zpGsNC-x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merchants-of-rosewall-critical-bug.jpg?itok=pZculPmh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another issue, though it’s a boon to players, is that companions assigned to a store task the day before, can remain assigned there even though they’ve crafted something. Typically, Companions are only able to do one task per day. This is seen when you go into the storefront menu. Companions assigned to workshops are grayed out, unable to be moved to a shop position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, one may fill the slot they were in previously. If you don’t replace that Companion or take them out of the lineup, you’ll get the bonus from that slot, even though you’re not supposed to. This makes the game easier, so it’s not the worst bug, but one nonetheless.</p>

<h2><em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> is an endearing entry in the shop management genre. Not only is the way you operate the shop different from other titles, it also has an interesting story laced throughout. Progression-blocking bugs can be problematic if encountered, but Big Blue Sky Games developers are already working on solutions. Whether you’re interested in management games or visual novels, <em>Merchants of Rosewall</em> is a title to check out.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-is-out-on-july-11-developed-by-iron-galaxy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Activision has confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remaster-supposedly-being-shadow-dropped-at-xbox-game-showcase-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier rumors</a> that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is indeed in development and will be released on July 11 on all leading gaming platforms, including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. Truth be told, leakier extas1s said it would be shadow-dropped during Microsoft's Xbox Game Showcase in June, but July certainly isn't too far off that mark.</p>
<p>Anyway, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is coming, which is the most important thing for fans after the skater himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a false start a while ago when Vicarious Visions got merged with Blizzard. This time, the remake is being made by Iron Galaxy, the developer that was behind the PC port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> and also the studio picked by Naughty Dog to port both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II to the PC platform.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 includes everything in the original, plus new skaters and parks, extra tricks, and new tracks to crank up. Iron Galaxy says that the parks from both games have been authentically recreated with streamlined goals in a two-minute format. New parks include the so-called Waterpark with its grindable slides and a drained lazy river that's tailor-made for vert trick combos.</p>
<p>Through in-game challenges, players will earn in-game cash and access new gear, including new decks, grip tapes and wheels for their boards, and extra apparel for their skaters. Cross-platform online multiplayer supports up to eight skaters at a time. Iron Galaxy also added a New Game+ mode where players can retain the stats they had previously earned in their first playthrough.</p>
<p>Newcomers should have an easier way in thanks to an in-game tutorial led by Tony Hawk himself, featuring lessons on the all-important Ollie, kick flips, vert tricks, grinds, reverts, manuals, special tricks, and more. Last but not least, the original soundtrack has been expanded with new music.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D-PedsiljOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-ordering Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch will provide access to the Foundry Demo due to launch in June, including two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs. Players who pre-order the game will also gain instant access to the in-game Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>
<p>As offered by pretty much all games nowadays, the Digital Deluxe Edition lets players in before the official July 11 launch date. That's on top of the following in-game bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Doom Slayer:&nbsp;</b>Play as Doom Slayer, featuring a Standard and Retro outfit plus two unique special tricks and the Unmaykr Hoverboard.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Revenant:</b>&nbsp;Get evil with the Revenant, including two unique special tricks.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Additional Music:</b>&nbsp;Headbang to a selection of classic and modern music tracks added to the in-game soundtrack.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Skate Decks:&nbsp;</b>Access additional skate decks including Doom Slayer and Revenant themed designs.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Create-A-Skater Items:&nbsp;</b>Kit out your skater with additional apparel items, including a baseball cap, two sweatshirts, and two t-shirts.</sub></li>
</ul>

            <p>Every now and then we publish a round-up of game or demo recommendations, and all you regular readers dutifully fill the comments with recommendations of your own. FOOLS. Our round-ups are, of course, a devious trap for your curiosity and connoisseurship, designed to save us the labour of discovering good games for ourselves. You know in Batman Forever when Jim Carrey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAjgzwFHXd4">uses Riddler TV to steal everybody's IQs</a>?

<p>Batman Forever is the wrong analogy for this news piece. Let's get back on track. I learned about Moadra from a comment by Galactic Man on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">our latest Steam Fest demo round-up</a>, Developed by Gloomsoft, it casts you as a dinkier species of Predator, scouring inky catacombs of corpseflesh for a missing alien princess.</p>
<p>That's the plan, anyway, until you find the princess and she rips your gun-arm off. Fortunately, a fugitive boffin soon hooks you up with a new arm comprised of evolving primordial muck. Thanks to this timely injection of locally grown biomatter, you gain access to an upgrades tree with unlockable appendages such as Morrigan-style vampire wings. Then you set off afresh to find that pesky princess and, I imagine, rip <em>her</em> arms off. I think Moadra has the right attitude toward monarchy so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713730/Moadra/">The Steam demo</a> plays a lot like the more recent iterations of Metroid, with a fast, nimble protagonist who can crawl into chutes (no Samusball functionality, alas) and charge up projectiles that bounce from certain surfaces. The backdrop is straight out of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>, however. Everything looks like the inside of a sickly lung. Such technology as may be found is busted and unclean.</p>
<p>A smaller point of differentiation: you shoot doors to open them, as in Metroid, but in Moadra - oh, I'm just picking up on the fact that "Moadra" sounds like "Metroid" through the Predator's voicebox! - you shoot them to activate short-ranged teleporters that flense you apart and put you back together in the next room. To ask the age-old question regarding teleporters, am I dying every time I use one, with my atoms and memories then forming a brand new being?</p>
<p>Honestly, if that's the worst thing that happens in Moadra I'll be thankful. There's a bossfight that basically traps you inside a cybernetic stomach with a brace of turrets and the head of a bellowing rat ogre. There's also some scanner functionality care of a flying drone pal that naturally harkens forward to Metroid's first 3D incarnation, Metroid Prime. Perhaps a cloaking device as well, Gloomsoft?</p>
<p>Will Moadra stand apart from Metroid in hindsight or will it prove to be just the same old metroidvania fittings coated in squirming filth, like a Samus figurine retrieved from the toilet? I'm not sure, but I look forward to finding out. There's no release date yet. Thanks again, Galactic Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>When Donald Trump was running for reelection in 2024, he constantly spoke about his desire to add tariffs--or import taxes--on America's trading partners and rivals. Now, President Trump has gone through with that threat by imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The Chinese tariffs are on top of the 10% tariff that Trump ordered on the country last month. Taken together, this new round of tariffs may spell trouble for physical video games, according to an industry analyst.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ljkknpfsa22x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that physical video games that would be subject to these tariffs may simply not be made. Instead, publishers are likely to lean even harder on digital sales. Piscatella has previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-new-tariffs-could-lead-to-more-expensive-video-games-expert-says/1100-6528904/" data-ref-id="1100-6528904">written about the potential impact</a> of these tariffs, while noting that manufacturing game discs in America isn't a viable option since physical sales have been declining for years.</p><p>During Trump's first term in office, the video game industry successfully lobbied his administration to exclude them from the tariffs he placed on Chinese goods. There was no carveout in Trump's newest round of tariffs. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a public statement earlier this month warning that these tariffs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-warns-trump-tariffs-could-harm-the-video-game-industry/1100-6529197/" data-ref-id="1100-6529197">may have a devastating affect on all video game sales</a>.</p><p>Because the costs of tariffs are almost always passed to customers, it's the American consumer who will bear the brunt of these expenses. Piscatella has also indicated that the price of games--both physical and digital--may rise in response to Trump's tariffs. There's also fear that the tariffs could trigger an economic downturn or even a recession, which would further hurt players' ability to afford games.</p>

                <p>During its developer livestream on March 4, Bungie confirmed that Destiny 2's IO planet is coming back to the game. It will be the one of the locations where the new Heresy Act 2 activity, Court of Blades, will take place.</p><p>IO was sunset back in 2020 with the launch of Beyond Light to a critical response from players. In recent years, Bungie has also reprised formerly sunset planets including Mars, which was home to Savathun's Throne World, and Titan, where we rediscovered Sloane. This time around, IO's Remnants of Silver area will be the home of a new activity inspired by the roguelike elements that Bungie has been playing with in recent months.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453845" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453845"></a><figcaption>The return of IO's Remnant of Silver area</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg"></figure><p>IO is completely engulfed in Darkness, which Oryx, The Taken King, is desperately seeking out to regain power following his discovery that the Guardians were the ones to kill him. As he heads to IO, players will take part in the new Court of Blades activity and have direct interactions with him for the first time in years.</p><p>The Court of Blades is a matchmade activity designed to feel unique and challenging on each run. Bungie says it has "borrowed the concept of Augmentations from Onslaught" but that they differ in this case, as they provide challenges that players can find other ways to overcome. The Court of Blades also features a randomized set of armaments that are available for purchase between phases in order to combat those challenges.</p><p>Building a loadout will differ from day to day. Augmentations, the challenges applied to each run, begin to stack the more players complete the activity. It's possible to get a good combination that makes the run simple to complete, or a bad combination of certain bosses or Augmentations that just don't work together well. "We wanted players to have opportunities to shortcut those challenges, or combine the armaments to find a cool combo," Bungie says. Armaments will rotate on a daily basis, and Bungie hopes that this will generate a new meta each day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453846"></a><figcaption>Court of Blades Augmentation UI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Court of Blades activity is designed to take "around 10 minutes," activity designer Quentin Quinones-Rezin said during the livestream. There won't be any raid-like mechanics, nor will there be the health scaling seen in Act 1's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/" data-ref-id="1100-6529277">Nether</a> activity. "This is intended to be a bit of a less stressful, more fun activity, but the difficulty does escalate after every two challengers," continues Quinones-Rezin. The mechanics that Guardians can buy as armaments will sometimes provide antidotes or shortcuts to the Augmentations. Some you may recognize from the Nether, some will be brand new, and some will be borrowed from Exotics. For example, the Sunbracers effect can now be purchased in the Court of Blades using its currency, and could be effectively combined with something that increases ability regeneration.</p><p>Court of Blades will also feature an Expert mode for players looking for a challenge. While completing the Court of Blades activity will drop the Aptitude <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-destiny-2-heresy-weapons/1100-6529285/" data-ref-id="1100-6529285">Heresy weapons </a>more frequently, their Adept versions will only drop in Expert mode.</p>

            <p>
Sony has launched a new "centralised" Beta Program initiative for PlayStation, providing an easy way for the public to sign up help test PlayStation 5 and PC games, as well as various console and app features, ahead of their full release.
</p>
<p>
Sony describes PlayStation's Beta Program as a "easy, centralised place" where players can register to participate in a range of different betas. These are expected to include beta access to PlayStation 5 and PC games, PlayStation 5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even features for Sony's PlayStation website. Anyone interested in participating only needs to sign up once - invites will be send out automatically if a registered user is selected for a specific test, and they're then free to accept or decline that invition as they see fit.
</p>
<p>
"While we try to include as many players as possible in our beta programs," Sony explains in its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/">announcement on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "sometimes we may get more interest than we can accommodate. By joining this program, it enables you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee selection for a beta test."
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
Players can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/">sign up via the 'Beta Program at PlayStation' website</a>, but Sony notes a PlayStation Network account is required and must be in good standing with a current email address. Additionally, participants must meet the legal age requirement in their region, and can only participate when a specific beta test is available in that region.
</p>
<p>
"A big thanks to those of you who have participated in all of the betas we've offered across Sony Interactive over the years," it concludes. "It's about to get easier and more convenient."

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617038/see-you-at-the-warehouse">a whole lot of teasing</a>, it’s now official: remakes of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3</em> and <em>4</em> are on the way. Activision officially announced the new release — called <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> — which will include remakes of both seminal skateboarding games and is launching on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and the Switch on July 11th. It’ll also be available for subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p><p>Just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">the previous remakes</a>, the new collection will include all of the content from the original games, alongside some modern additions, including brand-new parks and a handful of current skaters like Olympic stars Rayssa Leal and Yuto Horigome. They’ll join the original cast, including the likes of Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Rodney Mullen, and, obviously, Tony Hawk.</p><p>The new game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, which worked with Vicarious Visions — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244924/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-remake-studio-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment-merger">now a part of Blizzard</a> — on the previous remake. Here’s a little before-and-after image comparing the original games to the updated version:</p><p>Activision says that the soundtrack — always an important part of a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game — will include classic songs from Motörhead, Gang Starr, KRS-One, and others, “alongside new tracks that capture the spirit of modern skate culture.” The game will also support cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p><p>The original remakes were well-received updates of some true classics, and the new game will be launching at a very interesting time for skateboarding games. In addition to clever indie releases like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339211/skate-city-new-york-review-apple-arcade">Skate City</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">OlliOlli World</a></em>, and the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a></em>, EA is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23189958/ea-skate-trailer-progress-update-playtest-sign-up">bringing back its long-dormant <em>Skate</em> series</a>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remaster of the third and fourth games in the franchise, has been officially revealed. The reveal comes after weeks of rumors and teases about the game’s announcement.</p>



<p>Launching on July 11—confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-3-4-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier leak</a>—Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 will feature the game’s original parks with a “classic roster of skaters”. There will also be new parks, skaters, and tricks for all players to experience on all platforms.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Skate through a robust Career mode taking on challenges across two tours, chase high scores in Single Sessions and Speedruns, or chill out and dig into the map in Free Skate,” Activision said via release. </p>



<p>The game is being developed by Iron Galaxy Studios, the team that handled the development of the Steam version of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2. Vicarious Visions, which initially developed the first remaster, was merged into Blizzard back in 2021 and rebranded as Blizzard Albany.</p>



<p>It was also announced that the game  will have cross-platform multiplayer supporting up to eight players at once. There will also be a New Game+ mode for players that want to play through the career multiple times without losing their stats.</p>



<p>When it launches, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>



<p>Those who pre-order the game will get access to the Foundry Demo in June. Lastly, players who buy the Digital Deluxe edition will get access to Doom Slayer and Revenant skaters along with extra in-game music, skate decks, and create-a-skater gear alongside three days early access on July 8.</p>
