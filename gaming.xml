		<p>We'll keep this short, as the holiday week has me a little behind. But hey, did you know we're rapidly approaching the one-year anniversary of <em>Remap</em>? It's wild to think how much has happened in the past year. We'd intended to blow this out, but life moments got in the way—early June is an odd time on our personal <em>and</em> gaming—calendars. We'll be doing an all-day livestream playing a bunch of games, but we're already planning something even better for later in June. Consider June to be a month of celebrating this moment, a moment we could not have reached without you. Much more to say soon!</p><p>-pk, who highly recommends HBO's <em>The Sympathizer </em>show</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>You get to hear one of the two panels I hosted as part of last month's LudoNarraCon. Working with them with a blast, I hope you've enjoyed the podcasts! There's one more coming.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an After Dark ahead of <em>Remap</em>'s first anniversary. In the past, we've recorded these before a big moment, as a way of capturing our thoughts in a little time capsule. Naturally, we're a ball of anxiety all over again.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>You'll get to hear that After Dark.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY:</strong> Remap Radio will get in the can again. I've finished both <em>Hellblade II</em> and <em>Animal Well</em>, so there'll be a lot of talk about. The end of my time with <em>Animal Well </em>was, like Janet, a little bit of a bummer. We'll get into it.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Beyond hearing Remap Radio, we'll kick off our all-day livestream with a variety of different games and fun times. You get a small hint: crowbar.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163823/pale-heart-destination-final-shape-interview-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ShQ8ex">The Pale Heart — the new location in<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>, which is located inside The Traveler — is more like a Destiny-themed funhouse than a completely new destination. And while that might sound like a boring or even disappointing way to end the first Destiny saga, it’s actually one of the most striking and engaging destinations in the franchise’s 10-year history.</p>
<p id="kAXq03">On a visit to Bungie HQ, I was able to explore The Pale Heart of The Traveler and learn about how exactly the studio is using Destiny nostalgia to fuel the end of the Light and Darkness saga. It’s a risky move to lean so heavily on the past, a fact that Bungie’s Catarina Macedo, project lead for <em>Destiny 2</em> expansions, and Ben Wommack, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s combat area lead, are well aware of. </p>
<p id="PqPvZc">“The Pale Heart specifically is shaped by the memories of whoever is there,” said Macedo. This is why there is a very “Earthy” feel to the start of The Pale Heart, and why the original<em> Destiny</em>’s Tower plays such a big role in the safer half of the space, since it’s influenced by the player character’s memories. At the same time, the other half of the destination is controlled by The Witness, which inspires a darker, creepier, and more abstract environment.</p>

<p id="gU7MPA">After speaking to Macedo and Wommack, I spent several hours just roaming through The Pale Heart, soaking it in, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23927863">playing with the new Prismatic subclass</a>. And while I was initially worried about it feeling too much like other places I’ve visited before in Destiny, Bungie appears to have stuck the landing here — at least in everything I’ve seen so far. The Pale Heart strikes a very promising balance between pulling on my heartstrings as a longtime Destiny player <em>and </em>giving me a regular dose of something new.</p>
<p id="iiQLWQ">Every time I walked through a space I recognized, the environment shifted to something slightly different or off before the familiar area had a chance to overstay its welcome. For example, there’s the Tree of Silver Wings from Season of Arrivals inside The Pale Heart, but this version has been smashed together with Hive architecture from <em>The Witch Queen</em>. When you pair that together with the entirely unique environment around the tree, the area feels both new and familiar. </p>
<p id="3ZHwLF">It’s an effective trick — giving the brain a dose of “I recognize that” dopamine with a chaser of surrealism — one that I was constantly impressed by during my time at the event. It’s a bit hard to grasp how effective this is when you just read it on the page or see it in a quick gameplay video; I know I was skeptical before experiencing it myself. But the way Bungie has twisted its world here ends up being very effective. </p>

<p id="POGVRO">The entire trip left me feeling quite positive about <em>The Final Shape </em>expansion as a whole, but The Pale Heart genuinely wowed me in several places. Looking up to see The Speaker’s weird, mysterious machine covered in foliage next to two building-sized Ghosts forced me to stop and just take in the scenery for a moment. And that’s not something I do much in games that I’ve already spent thousands of hours in. </p>
<p id="7MXjBA">For longtime players like myself, it made me feel a bit like a kid in a candy store, to use a very tired simile. I was constantly stopping to go, “Oh wow, that’s this old location, but upside down!” or “I recognize this building, but how?” which was always followed by delight when I finally placed the memory. But the more I explored, the more the nostalgia became less important to the overall experience, and I found myself appreciating the whole package even more.</p>
<p id="BKrTiQ">I’m certain there will be some Destiny players out there who will be furious that Bungie reused so much old art to create The Pale Heart. But having experienced it, I think that’s the wrong way to look at it. Sure, I’ve been to this junkyard in the Cosmodrome before — it’s where I was first resurrected — but I don’t recall all the trees being shaped like hands back in the first <em>Destiny</em>. And that sounds so small, I know, but when you walk onto the abandoned highway and you see the hand trees growing up around The Witness’ massive fortress, the comfort of nostalgia is just enough to keep you pushing further into the unknown. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163822/prismatic-final-shape-interview-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="mWbo27">When I first saw the debut trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic">Prismatic</a> — the new, “advanced” subclass coming to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841285/destiny-2-showcase-time-when-how-to-watch-bungie"><em>The Final Shape</em></a> — I told my friends, “This is the most significant change they’ve ever announced for Destiny.” And after a visit to Bungie HQ in Bellevue, Washington, to play part of the expansion early, I’m convinced I was right.</p>
<p id="Y62g1B">“Putting Prismatic in is probably going to change Destiny on a fundamental level,” Ben Wommack, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s combat area lead, told me at our on-site interview. “But that’s kind of the intention of releasing that kind of feature in the game.” </p>
<p id="WUsJ9U">If you’re unfamiliar, Prismatic doesn’t add any new abilities to the game, like the Stasis or Strand Darkness subclasses that Guardians have gotten in previous years (although each class is getting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary">a new Super and Aspect</a> in <em>The Final Shape</em>, which is separate from Prismatic). Instead, the idea is that Guardians can combine elements together from all of their subclasses to create far more elaborate and powerful builds than ever before.</p>
<p id="jYbJhC">For example, if I currently want to use the Thundercrash Super on my Titan, I have to be on my Arc subclass, because Thundercrash is an Arc ability. Prismatic lifts those restrictions — mostly — so when <em>The Final Shape</em> launches, I can use Thundercrash for boss damage while also running around with a Strand Shackle grenade and a Void-throwing Shield. </p>

<p id="F8Y19p">Then there’s Transcendence, which is a new Super-like ability that you can charge up by dealing Light and Darkness damage in equal measure. Damage with Light-based weapons or abilities fills up the Light bar, while the opposite fills up the Darkness bar. When you’ve filled both bars, you can “Transcend,” which refills all of your ability energy, temporarily increases your weapon damage and defense, and gives you a Transcendence-exclusive grenade.</p>
<p id="PD0W9u">It’s all very overwhelming, but like Wommack said, that’s kind of the point. </p>
<p id="sQ5bXi">“I think this is really us giving a big love letter to the master build crafters of the game,” said Wommack. “We’re gonna give you a lot to think about. And we do want you to think about it, because we think about it.”</p>
<p id="f0N8xq">Catarina Macedo, the expansion project lead for <em>Destiny 2</em>, went on to say that Prismatic works from two angles: rewarding players who already have a lot of game knowledge — the “master build crafters” Wommack mentioned — and encouraging players who have very little experience with crafting builds to get in on the fun. Prismatic gives you so many more options than you’ve ever had in Destiny that it’s nearly impossible to look at the Prismatic customization screen and not think, <em>OK, how am I going to make these things work together?</em></p>
<p id="4V0FtD">Now, I’ve put together quite a few builds in my decade with Destiny, but during my preview I repeatedly found myself jumping into my menu and making slight tweaks to my Prismatic setup. Finding a way to consistently charge up my Transcendence meter felt like a real dance, and it had me thinking about how well my loadout synergized with my class setup. I’d gotten a sweet Stasis and Strand Titan build together that let me freeze and suspend everything, but without any Light abilities, I was having a really tough time getting the Light side of my Transcendence buff bar going.</p>

<p id="3S8ZFH">To fix it, I started changing up my weapons, and I swapped a Strand melee for an Arc one. Now kills with my primary and heavy weapons were contributing to my Light bar, while most of my abilities gave me Darkness energy. Every time I tried out a new build, I’d have to go through this iteration process. And each time, the game would reward me for it, as if every piece of the puzzle I managed to slot in made me that much stronger. I wasn’t just build-crafting so I could take down a big raid boss or a difficult Grandmaster Nightfall, I was doing it because it was fun.</p>
<p id="ymrzFO">Fun as it was, I did leave Bungie HQ with a few concerns regarding Prismatic. </p>
<p id="omgDh8">First, I felt so powerful using Prismatic that I couldn’t help but wonder how Bungie ever plans to challenge me again. The Legendary campaign missions I played felt much easier than <em>Lightfall </em>and <em>The Witch Queen </em>once I figured out how to maximize my newfound powers. But Bungie has <a href="https://youtu.be/RqIvKN4gtto?t=6188">already promised</a> that the new <em>Final Shape</em> raid is going to be one of the franchise’s hardest, and after the uber-difficult <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/23859673/crotas-end-raid-walkthrough">Crota’s End reprise</a> last summer, I’m willing to give Bungie the benefit of the doubt here.</p>
<p id="5JfBrY">My more serious concern was over what abilities and Aspects the developers have decided to include with Prismatic, as you can currently only pair certain abilities from each element together.</p>
<p id="2pIu4G">The team at Bungie decided to use some of the least popular Aspects from each class when making Prismatic. This meant I only had access to Aspects I don’t spend a lot of time using. On one hand, that was pretty exciting, as it helped the whole package feel fresh. On the other hand, I couldn’t help but wonder what kinds of builds I’d be able to make if Bungie removed the restrictions even more. </p>

<p id="L0sZX8">What if I could pair the Solar Titan’s Sol Invictus Sunspots Aspect with the Void Titan’s Controlled Demolition Aspect so I could spread explosive, healing puddles of fire around the entire arena? Surely that would be even stronger and harder to balance than the Prismatic I played during my preview — which is probably why both of those Aspects are unavailable for Prismatic. But the new subclass is so fun that it’s a bit of a bummer that I can’t just play out whatever bizarre Titan fever dream my brain can come up with.</p>
<p id="g8Qij5">That might sound like whining because you can only have cake <em>or </em>ice cream — and it kind of is — but that’s OK with the folks I spoke to at Bungie.</p>
<p id="qEthZJ">“We have a lot of future plans that we’re hoping to, you know, change and react to, depending on how players react to Prismatic in the first day, first weekend, through the raid race, through the first week,” said Wommack. He told me that the developers want and expect players to think about how non-Prismatic Aspects would impact their Prismatic build. But the hope is that those same players would also ask themselves questions like, “Well, how would Bungie balance that?”</p>
<p id="MaHWJa">There are a few ways to look at Wommack’s statement there, but to me it’s clear that Prismatic is an experiment, like Stasis was for the subclass 3.0 system back in 2020. Ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>’s launch, that experiment is already the most interesting thing that’s come to Destiny in years. But what will this experiment look like in a few months, or even next year? That’s the question that all Destiny fans should really be asking once <em>The Final Shape</em> arrives on June 4. </p>

Finally, folks who subscribe to the sub will also get a cosmetic drop with one legendary item and whatever an Epic bundle might be on the 28th of each month.</p><p>There’s a decent amount of stuff there for the diehard fans of <em>Siege</em>, and the rest of the battle pass rewards also give out unique weapon and operator skins—as well as in-game currency to add value—but the timing of the sub couldn’t be worse. <em>Siege </em>is in the middle of its ninth year, which would be impressive if the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/roadmap&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current roadmap for the year</a></span> hadn’t already let down players with its gaping lack of new content.</p><p>The roadmap for the next half year includes a lot of reworks to existing characters and systems, and while part of <em>Siege</em>’s plans for a long while, it’s not met with a wealth of new additions to keep fans happy. Such reworkings are, at this point, a staple of maintaining a live-service title. These games can’t always just throw in new maps, characters and abilities <em>every</em> season, and at some point that constant growth slows to account for the imbalances it all creates. Eventually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-season-20-evo-armor-legend-abilities-1851218153&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-season-20-evo-armor-legend-abilities-1851218153">whole systems and locations need to be reworked</a></span> or completely overhauled. </p><p>The same has happened to games as big as <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, however most games don’t go most of the year with as few additions as <em>Siege </em>is making in 2024. It has added one new character, and <em>Siege </em>will add at least two more over the next few seasons, but the absolute bulk of “additions” coming for the rest of the year are changes to things that already exist in the game, which is beginning to become a sore spot for the community at the moment. And then here comes a bunch of new cosmetics, but they’re locked behind a new paywall.</p><p>To throw further fuel on the fire, subscriptions like this are commonplace in games that are otherwise free-to-play, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span><em>,</em> but <em>Siege </em>has remained a premium title over the years.

                <p dir="ltr">Ten years ago, the story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny/" data-ref-id="5000-38799">Destiny</a> started with the Traveler, a god-like entity the size of a small moon, hovering over Earth and dispensing superpowers to humans to use against encroaching alien hordes. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next expansion, we're finally primed to find out what's inside that massive robotic orb.</p><p dir="ltr">It's apparently pretty weird in there.</p><p dir="ltr">We've gotten a few brief glimpses into the Pale Heart of the Traveler, the new location where the final showdown between the heroes of humanity and the Witness, Destiny 2's primary antagonist, will take place. In a recent hands-off preview event, however, Bungie gave something of an extended look into the Pale Heart, a pocket of the universe where memories and emotions combine with the Traveler's near-magical paracausal power to redefine reality.</p><p dir="ltr">The Pale Heart is a place that, according to Bungie, draws on the experiences of whoever's inside it to create the world they see around them. In the early missions of The Final Shape's campaign, you'll see nostalgic elements from the last 10 years of Destiny folded into the landscape--things like giant Ghost shells and overgrown segments of old locations, levels, and social spaces.</p><p dir="ltr">But the Traveler's power, the Light, is clashing with the Darkness power wielded by the Witness, and that's also causing the landscape to twist and contort, especially as you delve deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can kind of think of it like traversing a world in the process of being defragmented," said campaign lead Andrew Hopps during the preview.</p><p dir="ltr">While the preview didn't give an extensive overview of the expansion, it did provide some impressions of what players can expect, showing off portions of the first mission of its campaign and a later Strike that's also part of the story. The mission begins with the Guardian, the player's character, heading into the big pink portal into the Traveler that has been staring players in the face for the last year. It's not just a matter of stepping into the portal and popping out the other side, though. Instead, you'll make your way over a disjointed collection of chunks of architecture, spaceships, and terrestrial locations, all haphazardly thrown together. If the Pale Heart is combining different elements from memory to create a new reality, the portal feels like the place where all those bits are stored until they're needed; like the memories are manifesting into new objects, but without any guidance putting them together in a meaningful way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308416-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308416" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308416-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308416"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308416-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As is probably expected, the path through the portal is home to enemies who try to stop you. These include the Taken, which now sport a spooky yellow eye--an indicator of the Witness's control over them. This is also the place where you'll first start to encounter Destiny 2's new enemy faction, the Dread. Bungie previously detailed the different threats that make up the Witness's new army, but you'll start by running into Weavers, small enemies that use the Strand abilities introduced in the Lightfall expansion to nab you with ethereal ropes. Weavers can grab and yank you toward themselves and out of cover, exposing you to attack or, sometimes, just tossing you off a cliff.</p><p dir="ltr">Hopps noted that Bungie has spent time rebalancing the campaign's difficulty, particularly at the Legendary level. The idea is to make sure missions feel tough but fair, whether you're playing alone or with a team of one or two other people, although Hopps didn't go into specifics about what adjustments developers have made. Bungie is also putting a greater emphasis on adding raid- and dungeon-like mechanics to more missions, and in the preview, we saw elements like the Light and Darkness "seeds" that appear in Lightfall's Root of Nightmares raid. These don't work quite the same way as in the raid, and you'll be able to use all these mechanics as a solo player, Hopps said. But in both the campaign mission and the Strike shown during the presentation, there were additional mechanics that should make progressing through the Pale Heart a little more complex than just shooting a lot of monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie soon cut away from the portal portion of the mission, skipping ahead to after the player had finally fully entered the Traveler. Here, we got our first glimpses of the Pale Heart, where the early portions are lush and green. In some moments, plants and rocks are popping into being directly ahead of you as you walk, and soon you're finding strange sights, like chunks of the Last City and those huge Ghost shells, overgrown and almost ancient-looking as they poke out of the landscape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308418-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308418" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308418-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308418"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308418-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_009.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308446-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308447-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308448-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308449-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308450-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308446,1300-4308447,1300-4308448,1300-4308449,1300-4308450" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308446-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308447-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308448-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308449-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308450-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_000.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308446-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308447-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308448-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308449-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308450-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_000.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"This was something that we did from the beginning in concept for The Final Shape, that we really wanted this big moment after the 10 years of the Light and Darkness Saga to invoke a lot of nostalgia from the players," said expansions project lead Catarina Macedo. "And one of the ways we wanted to do that was by the environment that you go through. So we had this idea that as you go into the Traveler, everything around you is shaped by these memories of you being a Guardian, places that you've been to, things that you've seen, scenes that you've lived."</p><p dir="ltr">The level sends the player passing through these overgrown chunks of the City, where they encounter more Dread enemies. These include the "bats with guns," the Grim, which sport a stunning shriek ability that can be particularly dangerous if it nails you while you're trying something harrowing like jumping over a gap. The Grim are also the first flying enemies in Destiny 2 that have wings, which means they bob up and down as you fight them, adding a slightly different wrinkle to combat. Even farther in, players run into a Harbinger--a new Dread enemy that occupies the same place as the Tormentor in terms of danger presented to opponents. Where Tormentors feel like smaller versions of the Root of Nightmare boss Nezarec, Harbingers are more similar to Rhulk, the boss of the Vow of the Disciple raid.</p><p dir="ltr">The Harbinger also wields Strand abilities, turning some player powers back against them. The Harbinger can suspend you with Strand the exact same way opponents can in player-vs.-player battles, locking you in place and opening you up to serious damage. Harbingers generally are less mobile than Tormentors but rely on ranged fighting rather than melee attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The landscape of the Pale Heart is reacting to the presence of Guardians, filling the world with elements from their memories and experiences. But the Witness is also having the same effect, and things will get more corrupted and darker as you draw closer to it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308423-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308423" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308423-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_000.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308423"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308423-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_000.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308451-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308452-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_008.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308453-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_010.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308454-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308451,1300-4308452,1300-4308453,1300-4308454" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308451-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308452-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_008.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308453-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_010.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308454-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_006.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308451-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308452-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_008.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308453-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_010.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308454-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're doing this thing, kind of for the first time, where we do a lot of storytelling through the environment," said game director Tyson Green. "You travel from a place where you know where you are and what's going on, and it feels relatively safe, into a place of increasing danger and proximity to the Witness. It's really a very striking environmental journey that we haven't really done with any of our previous expansions."</p><p dir="ltr">After the first mission, Bungie showed off a new Strike that takes place about halfway through the campaign. Here, we've ventured deeper into the Pale Heart in pursuit of the Witness, and the landscape has changed drastically, becoming more rocky, desolate, and barren. This one is themed after Destiny's "wish dragons," the Ahamkara, with players facing a huge Tormentor boss known as "Tormentor of the Ahamkara."</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things that we've seen even in previous releases, especially when we started getting into the pyramids and seeing what their architecture looks like, we saw a lot of reshaping of normal objects. I'm sure everyone remembers the horse with many butts and all that," Macedo said. "Because the Witness is trying to enact the Final Shape [and] reshape everything to perfect stillness, one of the big things that we wanted to do as the Guardian gets closer to the spire where the Witness is at the center of the Pale Heart, we wanted to bring more of that distortion and reshaping, and more unease, and that feeling that this isn't quite right."</p><p dir="ltr">"So that was the big inspiration behind that: Take that language and basically turn the knob all the way to 100, and see how twisted can we get," Macedo continued.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308445-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_strike_compressed_007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308445" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308445-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_strike_compressed_007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308445"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308445-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_strike_compressed_007.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308455-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308456-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308457-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_003.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308458-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308459-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308460-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308455,1300-4308456,1300-4308457,1300-4308458,1300-4308459,1300-4308460" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308455-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308456-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308457-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_003.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308458-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308459-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4308460-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_006.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308455-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308456-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308457-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_003.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308458-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308459-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308460-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m5_compressed_006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Strike includes Dread enemies and Taken, while also introducing another foe players will face: the Lucent Brood, the Hive under the control of Savathun, the Witch Queen. Savathun and her forces are also trying to oppose the Witness, Green noted, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're on your side. In the Strike, you'll fight Lucent Hive on a few different occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the campaign, the Strike also works in new mechanics that are a little more comparable to dungeons or raids than we've seen in previous strikes. You chase the Tormentor through the Strike, working through gaping caves and barren valleys. As you fight the Strike's major battles against enemies like Harbingers, you'll find weird Darkness goo flooding into the area, as well as major opponents with unbreakable shields. To clear them, you'll need to seek out nearby Ahamkara skulls. Finding an item called Taken Essence allows you to empower the skulls, breaking the shields. It's <em>getting</em> the Taken Essence, however, that's the tough part.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, you'll venture into a side room in search of what you need to empower the Ahamkara skulls. In the sections we saw, the rooms are full of walls and platforms, and when you grab the Taken Essence at the far end, you have to run back as Darkness sludge fills in around you. In one room, the walls close in toward you like a trap in an Indiana Jones movie, forcing you to leap over and duck under obstacles as you hustle out. In another, the sludge fills the room from the floor up, so you need to climb up platforms to avoid it on your way out.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later area, you leap through a hole in the wall to find yourself in an environment similar to the inside of Riven, the Ahamkara that serves as the final boss of the Last Wish raid, further solidifying the strange architecture and the reshaping of reality within the Pale Heart. In another section, you'll cross through a hallway filled with giant arms made of stone. The statues serve as platforms, and take the shapes of human and Hive hands, as well as Ahamkara tentacles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

from the Witness's memories.</p><p dir="ltr">"We don't want to get into spoilers, but a lot of what you'll see are not just your memories, but memories of other things that are in the Pale Heart--so

                <p dir="ltr">When players jump into the story campaign for Destiny 2's next expansion, The Final Shape, they'll pretty quickly unlock one of the biggest new parts of the game: Prismatic. The new subclass is necessary to complete The Final Shape's story, just like Strand was when it was introduced in Destiny 2's last expansion, Lightfall.</p><p dir="ltr">But unlike how Lightfall handled its new player abilities, Bungie says you'll get Prismatic early in The Final Shape, and you'll have access to it for the duration--it won't be parceled out in short bursts and only fully unlocked many hours later, once you finish the campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie gave a pretty close look at Prismatic in action, and The Final Shape's campaign generally, in a recent hands-off preview event attended by GameSpot. The preview showed a big chunk of the campaign's first mission, as well as a later Strike mission that becomes available about halfway through the story. As in Lightfall, the new subclass is an essential part of the story of The Final Shape, and you'll make use of it as you go, but with a lot fewer restrictions this time around.</p><p dir="ltr">Prismatic is less a totally new subclass than a new combination of old elements. It pieces together different parts of existing subclasses, like supers, melee and grenade abilities, and passive buffs, allowing you to access several different kinds of powers--specifically both Light and Dark abilities--that you previously couldn't utilize at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass also comes with a new ability called Transcendence, which Bungie described as being like a "mini-super." While using the Prismatic subclass, dealing damage with your abilities and weapons charges up two meters, one for Light and one for Darkness. (Kinetic weapons increase both meters but at a lower rate than weapons with specific elemental damage types.) When both are full, you can activate Transcendence, which gives you increased damage reduction, speeds the recharging of your abilities, and gives you a new grenade ability that combines Light and Darkness damage types.</p><p dir="ltr">Prismatic as a concept starts to show up as you make your way through the first campaign mission. You'll first traverse the big pink portal into the Traveler that's been staring at players for the last year. Inside, you'll encounter the Taken, who Destiny 2's major antagonist, the Witness, is controlling more directly than ever before. You'll also soon encounter enemies who are "bound" by the Witness, receiving power from the Witness directly, which provides them with shields that can't be broken with your normal abilities or weapons. When you first run into them in the starting mission while traversing the portal, you'll have to flee.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308476-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308476-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308476"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308476-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_campaign_m1_compressed_003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A major element of The Final Shape is the fact that the Traveler's Light power and the Witness's Darkness are commingling within the expansion's new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler. After running into the bound enemies, the preview skipped ahead to a later part of that same first campaign mission, when players find themselves inside the Traveler for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside encountering more enemies, including the new Dread faction, you'll start to find places where the Light and the Darkness have collided to create strange wellsprings of power. Standing in those springs allows you to briefly access Transcendence, much like players could activate Strand briefly at certain points in Lightfall. Transcendence gives you a chance to try out Prismatic in short bursts and to break those bound enemies' shields. However, unlike Strand, you can run back to these wellsprings again and again during a battle if you want (and can survive), allowing you to regain Transcendence as needed.</p><p dir="ltr">Transcendence is especially useful against some of the new enemies The Final Shape is introducing to the game. At the end of the first campaign mission, we saw a boss fight against a Harbinger, one of the tougher new baddies, which wields Strand abilities against the player. Harbingers take after Rhulk, the boss of The Witch Queen expansion's Vow of the Disciple raid; they're tough to kill and use ranged weapons against you. They also have the ability to suspend you, much like players can do to each other in Destiny 2's player-vs.-player mode, the Crucible, rendering you immobile and vulnerable for a few seconds. Using Transcendence isn't essential to winning the fight once you've killed any bound enemies, but its new abilities and perks can definitely be helpful.</p><p dir="ltr">While you'll be able to use Transcendence during missions by finding its wellsprings, The Final Shape doesn't just lock Prismatic up behind these environmental activation points. By the end of the first mission, you'll have entered a strange, overgrown version of the Tower from the original Destiny and ventured into the room where the Vanguard leaders used to hang out. In that place of power, you'll find a well of energy so powerful, it permanently unlocks Prismatic, allowing you to use the subclass for the rest of the campaign.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308477-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308477-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308477"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308477-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_008.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The thing is, while you'll get Prismatic right away, Bungie doesn't want you to feel like you're either forced to use it, or forced not to. If you've got other character builds you're comfortable with and want to use throughout The Final Shape's campaign, combat area lead Ben Wommack said, you'll be able to do that. The wellsprings give you a shorter-duration version of Transcendence so you can try it out and get through fights that require it, but you can still stick with your favorite subclass if you'd prefer.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things about Prismatic that we wanted to be very careful of is, we didn't want to make Prismatic at the top of every other build, supplanting every other build you can do it with," Wommack said. "That's not good gameplay; it's not fun. We want Prismatic to be this amazing new tool, not the thing that supplants everything else."</p><p dir="ltr">During the preview presentation, Bungie showed off the Hunter take on Prismatic. This one combined elements like the Stasis melee ability Withering Blade, the Void buff Stylish Executioner, the Solar grenade ability Gunpowder Gamble, and the new Arc super ability, Storm's Edge. It also detailed how Bungie has adjusted these abilities to make them work better with Prismatic. For example, in a Void build, Stylish Executioner will turn you invisible when you kill an enemy suffering from a Void-based debuff. With the Prismatic version, <em>any</em> debuff can trigger Stylish Executioner, including the Stasis slowing effect enemies get when you hit them with Withering Blade.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first unlock the new subclass, Wommack said, you'll start with a "curated" version that combines specific abilities. Bungie went through a lot of iterations to make sure that each class's starting version of Prismatic would be a compelling combination of elements that make the subclass worth playing with, but without making other builds obsolete.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308478-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308478" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308478-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308478"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308478-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Prismatic is built on customization. You won't be able to mix and match every perk, ability, and super from your other subclasses together, but you will have access to a lot of them. Adding more options requires unlocking Aspects and Fragments that give you different abilities and benefits, like with past subclasses.</p><p dir="ltr">But where Lightfall had you killing enemies to earn "Strand Meditations" in order to unlock different elements of the subclass, a system many players didn't really like, The Final Shape will award you with Aspects and Fragments as you work through the story campaign, or from exploring the Pale Heart. There should also be less grind in getting everything you need for effective builds on all three of your characters. While the preview showed off a Prismatic build for Hunters, all three classes will have plenty to work with.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to give every class an equivalent amount of build options," Wommack said. "We're doing something with the Fragments where there's a shared pool they all have, so if you have Fragments you unlocked on your Hunter, then you can use those Fragments on your Warlock or Titan. So we're trying really hard not to play favorites."</p><p dir="ltr">The focus on making sure players can gain Prismatic and all its customization elements through the campaign also helps guarantee it'll be available for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/">The Final Shape's raid</a>, which launches just three days after the expansion's release.</p><p dir="ltr">"You will be able to fully unlock Prismatic by playing through the campaign and the journey in the Pale Heart before the raid launches," Wommack confirmed. "That is something that everyone is going to have access to and be able to accomplish."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308479-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308479-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308479"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4308479-2024_tfs_press_preview_event_press_kit_combat_compressed_006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the launch of The Final Shape, only certain abilities and elements will be available as part of Prismatic--you won't be able to mix and match every single melee ability or super into a new subclass of your choosing. In addition to keeping Prismatic from replacing all the other, more specific subclasses, Bungie limited the options to make sure the subclass would be balanced, especially in the Crucible, Destiny 2's player.-vs.-player mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Wommack said Bungie wants to see how players handle Prismatic, and how it impacts the game, before thinking too much about what other elements and abilities it might add to the subclass later.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're kind of reserving any future decision about what we add to Prismatic until we actually get it out there into people's hands and see how it's doing," he said. "We're going to pay a lot of attention to what the balance is and what the impact is, and in PvP, of course. We're paying a lot of attention to what Transcendence up time is in PvP, just like with super up-time, that economy is super important and we put a lot of thought into it."</p><p dir="ltr">As game director Tyson Green noted, despite the fact Bungie has done a lot of testing on Prismatic, it's still impossible to say what will happen once it's in the hands of the Destiny 2 community.</p><p dir="ltr">"On the first day when players get their hands on Prismatic, they'll get about 1,000 times more playtest time than we've ever been able to put into it during development," Green said. "We're going to learn a lot during the first 24 or 48 hours,and we're going to react to that, because that's what we do."</p><p dir="ltr">For more from the preview event, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-final-shape-brings-new-depth-to-its-missions-and-defragmented-world/1100-6523728/" data-ref-id="1100-6523728">what we learned about the new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Final Shape is set to release on June 4.</p>

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of its annual Days of Play 2024 event, PlayStation today revealed its lineup of monthly games for those subscribed to PlayStation Plus in the month of June. If you feel like the monthly games lineup has been weak as of late, I doubt the games for June will change that feeling.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-the-monthly-games-for-june-on-ps" data-injectable="false">The Monthly Games for June on PS+</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">The three monthly games for June on PlayStation Plus became available for members on June 4, and here are the games:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>AEW Fight Forever</em></li> <li><em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em></li> <li><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></li> </ul> <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">Hopefully a dream lineup for you included two fighting games and a SpongeBob game, because that’s what we got. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-streets-of-rage-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em> is actually a pretty solid game</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/cosmic-shake-review-spongebob-squarepants/">as is <em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em></a>, but neither are exactly major releases by any means. <em>AEW Fight Forever</em> isn’t my cup of tea, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/aew-fight-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on Metacritic scores</a> it’s rather average anyway. Overall this just feels like yet another lackluster “What can we grab from the bargain bin” type month for PlayStation Plus, which unfortunately has been pretty part for the course lately.</p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">If you haven’t grabbed it yet, one of the May Monthly Games, <em>EA Sports FC 24</em> will remain available for PS+ members until June 18, so make sure you redeem it by then.</p> <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Here are the rest of the new additions coming to the PS+ Game Catalog, Classic Catalog, PS VR2 and Game Trials for the month of June:</p> <p data-characters="12" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><strong>PS VR2 Games</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Before Your Eyes</em></li> <li><em>Ghostbusters; Rise of the Ghost Lord</em></li> <li><em>Synth Riders</em></li> <li><em>Walkabout Mini Golf</em></li> <li><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapters 1 &amp; 2</em></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="12" data-current-count="12" data-injectable="false"><strong>PS2 Classics</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="132" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racoonus</em></li> <li><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></li> <li><em>Tomb Raider Legend</em></li> </ul> <p data-characters="22" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false"><strong>Game Catalog Additions</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Cricket 24</em> (PS4 and PS5 on June 5)</li> <li><em>Dredge</em> (PS4 and PS5 on May 29)</li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition</em> (PS4 and PS5 on June 7)</li> <li><em>Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2</em> (PS4 on May 31)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="false">Also, on May 29 a Game Trial for <em>WWE 2K24</em> will become available for Premium members on PS4 and PS5. Even though the actual monthly games are a bit of a let down, <em>Dredge </em>is a lot of fun, and I’ll never turn down a reason to play <em>Sly Cooper</em> again.</p>

<p>For long-time fans of the survival horror genre, we’re living in something of a renaissance. We routinely receive high-quality remakes and remasters of our favorite old-school horror games. Then, you have upcoming AA and AAA horror titles and the indie horror gaming scene. It’s an excellent time to be a horror gaming fan. But what about the Silent Hill 2 Remake release date? That’s what we want to know more about!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-silent-hill-2-remake-release-date">Do We Know the Silent Hill 2 Remake Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no word yet as to an official release date for Silent Hill 2 Remake. That said, Konami recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, an upcoming showcase in which they’ll reveal more about their survival horror remake. We might even see a few other projects from within the series.</p>



<p>While unconfirmed, we may see additional gameplay from Silent Hill 2 Remake and a potential release date or window during the upcoming showcase. The publisher announced the survival horror remake in October 2022; by then, development had been ongoing for an unknown period. By now, the remake should be nearly finished, so we’re hoping for a fall release window, perhaps around Halloween.</p>



<p>Once we have an official release date, you’ll be the first to know right here on Insider Gaming!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-silent-hill-2-a-remake-or-remaster">Is Silent Hill 2 a Remake or Remaster?</h2>



<p>There’s a difference between “remake” and “remaster,” despite some developers and fans confusing the two terms. A remaster is simply an update to an existing game that enhances the graphics and sound while retaining much of its original gameplay elements. It’s a way to ensure you can still enjoy your favorite classics on modern hardware.</p>



<p>A remake, however, completely redoes the entire experience from the ground up in—often—a brand-new engine for modern times. It features enhanced gameplay elements for the contemporary player, better graphics, occasionally new content, and plenty of quality-of-life tweaks to the core experience. It’s the best way to play an old-school classic!</p>



<p>Well, you’ll be excited to know that the upcoming Silent Hill 2 is a genuine remake, built for the modern audience!</p>



<hr>



<p>While it’s fantastic that we’ll see more of the Silent Hill franchise soon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-isnt-coming-anytime-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 isn’t so lucky and may not launch anytime soon</a>. For more about your favorite games, we recommend signing up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

Resident Evil Zero originally came out on Nintendo GameCube in 2002 and then received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-0-hd-remaster-review/1900-6416332/#:~:text=The%202002%20remake%20of%20the,lighting%20and%20new%20camera%20angles." data-ref-id="1900-6416332">an HD remaster in 2016</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Considered the best offensive support in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Mortefi is capable of massively buffing the Heavy Attacks of his companions with his Outro Skill. He also shines through his ability to deal a fair amount of coordinated damage after triggering Burning Rhapsody. </p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">True to that, building him is a must for all looking to both awaken his true potential and that of some of the game’s best damage dealers. Here’s the best Mortefi build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-mortefi" data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Mortefi </h2> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The best weapon for Mortefi in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is the 5-star Static Mist. The weapon fits him like a glove by providing a total of 24.3% Crit Rate when at level 90. Static Mist will also boost his Energy Regen value by 12.8% and will allow Mortefi to provide even more buffs by increasing the ATK of the resonator taking the field after him by 10%. The values are referent to the weapon at Rank 1.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best 4-star Alternatives</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">As a support/sub-DPS whose kit revolves around using his Resonance Liberation, the best 4-star weapon for Mortefi is Cadenza. The pistol is my main pick, given its 51.8% Energy Regen stat at level 90. To help make rotations easier, Cadenza will also provide Mortefi with Concerto Energy after he performs his Skill. The effect can only be triggered once per 20-second intervals. </p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">If you are looking for damage over utility, Novaburst will be my main pick. Keep in mind that although the weapon offers a massive increase in ATK, the lack of vital secondary stats like Crit and ER will be felt. To add to the above, here’s an overview of our main 5 and 4-star picks, as well as a 3-star weapon sure to excel in Mortefi’s hands. </p>
 <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Best Weapons for Mortefi / Main Stat</th><th data-align="center">Reasons Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Static Mist (Best in Slot by a large margin) / Crit Rate</td><td data-align="center">Provides a massive amount of Crit Rate, while also buffing his ER value and allowing him to buff your DPS with an extra 10% ATK. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cadenza (main 4-star pick) / ER</td><td data-align="center">Offers a great Energy Regen sum and allows him to gain Concerto Energy by performing his Skill.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Novabuirst (Best 4-star for those looking for damage above utility) / ATK</td><td data-align="center">Boasts a high overall ATK value and will allow him to further enhance his Attack by up to 12% by dashing and dodging. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pistols of Night (Best 3-star) / ATK</td><td data-align="center">Provides a high amount of ATK when at R5. Capable of rivaling that of our 4-star picks.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Mortefi in WuWa</h2> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Mortefi is a 5-piece Moonlit Clouds. Once active, the Sonata will buff his ER by 10% and allow his Outro Skill to also boost the ATK of the character taking the field by 22.5%. The ATK boost will last for 15 seconds or until the affected unit leaves the field. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">For the Echoes, I recommend that you go with Impermanence Heron as your main in a one Overlord, two Common, and two Elites composition. Impermanence Heron is vital in the main slot given its ability to enhance the buff provided by Mortefi’s Outro Skill with a 15-second 12% Damage Bonus effect.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best Echo stats and substats for building Mortefi</h3> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Mortefi-Build-in-Wuthering-Waves-Best-Echoes.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">Go with Crit Rate as the main stat for the Impermanence Heron. This is a must, as Mortefi needs to be able to perform frequent criticals to excel as a sub-DPS. For the other echoes, I recommend going with a Fusion DMG pair, followed by Energy Regen and ATK. If using an ER weapon, change the latter to double ATK. </p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">Focus on Crit Rate, Energy Regen, Crit DMG, and ATK when talking substats. Lastly, try to get his Rate and ER values to at least 60 and 130% for optimal results. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Are Mortefi’s Resonance Chain Nodes a must?</h3> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Although not a must, unlocking Cathartic Waltz (his fourth Resonance Chain Node) will massively boost Mortefi’s potential. When unlocked, the node will increase the uptime of Burning Rhapsody by seven seconds for a total of 17. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best teams for Mortefi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">As Mortefi’s flames burn the brightest when paired with DPSs reliant on Heavy Attacks, the best team for him will feature <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan</a> as its main DPS and Verina as its healer/sub-DPS. This composition will rely on using Mortefi to massively buff Jiyan’s Qingloong Mode damage. Apart from her healing, we will also have in Verina a secondary source of off-the-field damage and buffs. </p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Thanks to their ability to perform enhanced Heavy Attacks within low intervals, Rover (Havoc) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-danjin-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danjin</a> can also work well in the main DPS role. For the healer spot, Baizhi can fill in extremely well for Verina.</p>

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking for a strong weapon in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, there’s a couple of places to find them without entering into the gacha system. One, the Dauntless Evernight (a Broadsword), can be found at the top of the skyscraper where you battle Inferno Rider, and another can be purchased using Lampylumen.</p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">Lampylumen is an ore resource which can be found in various places around Jinzhou, but it’s most heavily concentrated in the area where you battle Lampylumen Myriad in the tunnels beneath Tiger’s Maw Mine, accessed through the core of the tower in the middle of the mine itself. However, getting your hands on this 4-star weapon isn’t straightforward, and comes with a couple prerequisites to unlock the vendor you need.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">Namely, you’ll need to complete the first two acts of the Tiger’s Maw Exploration quests, which are:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false"> <li>Tiger’s Maw Act I: Hidden Dangers in Peaceful Life</li> <li>Tiger’s Maw Act II: Shadows of the Past</li> </ul> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">It’s worth noting that, <strong>between these two quests, you will need to wait for 24 hours of real time to pass</strong>. Xiaoyu will not contact you before at least 24 hours have passed, so it’s a good time to get some side quests and some sleep in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed these two quests, you’ll unlock a brand new vendor within Tiger’s Maw named Shilang, who will show up as a padlock shaped marker on the map.&nbsp;To access his wares, speak to him and select Tiger’s Maw Ore.</p> <h2 id="h-items-available-from-shilang-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Items available from Shilang in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">There’s a number of items available from Shilang in exchange for Lampylumen, but the biggest star here is the ability to purchase a 4 star weapon of your choice. The Originite Weapon Supply Chest costs 80 Lampylumen and contains one of the following weapons, depending on the choice you make when purchasing:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"> <li>Broadblade</li> <li>Sword</li> <li>Pistols</li> <li>Gauntlets</li> <li>Rectifier</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="42" data-injectable="false">The other items available to purchase are:</p> <figure data-found-rows="10" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Cost in Lampylumen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Medium Energy Core</td><td>2 each</td></tr><tr><td>Advance Energy Core</td><td>5 each</td></tr><tr><td>Premium Energy Core</td><td>10 each</td></tr><tr><td>Shell Credit (2,000)&nbsp;</td><td>1 each</td></tr><tr><td>Reactive Metallic Drip</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Waveworn Residue 226</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Extracted Phlogiston</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Cadence Bud</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Adagio Helix</td><td>3 each</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has turned out to be a pretty solid addition to the gacha game lineup, sporting an intense combat system and a solid amount of power systems and collection mechanics that have kept me playing over its first few days. Still, like many game releases, not everything has gone smoothly, and the first few days since release have&nbsp;been plagued&nbsp;with issues.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Kuro Games has <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been working hard to correct</a> many of these issues, and some patches have already started to roll out.&nbsp;To further apologize for the rough start, Kuro Games has also been&nbsp;handing out some goodies to players.&nbsp;The most anticipated&nbsp;of these&nbsp;is a voucher for a free basic 5-star unit.</p> <figure data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Rovers,<br>After yesterday's post, we have some new updates to share with you regarding our future plans for game improvements.<br>– We plan to make every type of story content skippable in future updates, giving you more control over your gameplay.

 <h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-the-free-5-star-voucher" data-injectable="false">How Do You Get the Free 5-star Voucher?</h2> <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="59" data-injectable="false">Getting the voucher is as simple as opening the mail.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">A letter will be sent to your&nbsp;mailbox,&nbsp;containing an item called the Voucher of Reciprocal Tides. Once you have acquired your item,&nbsp;simply&nbsp;go to the banners page&nbsp;and&nbsp;there will be an option to exchange the voucher for a basic 5-star unit. The units available are as follows:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"> <li>Verina</li> <li>Encore</li> <li>Lingyang</li> <li>Jianxin</li> <li>Calcharo</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="112" data-injectable="false">Players can also choose a 5-star they already own to get a node unlock on the character’s Resonance Chain.</p> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Players don’t have to&nbsp;make the decision&nbsp;immediately, as the voucher is good through May 22, 2025. That said, for new or free-to-play players&nbsp;the&nbsp;free pull is more than worth using ASAP. I suggest pulling Verina to get the best-in-class support in the&nbsp;game,&nbsp;or Calcharo for&nbsp;very solid&nbsp;DPS, but each player is free to make a decision that best fits their party needs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Players will also receive&nbsp;10&nbsp;free Radiant Tides if they have reached Union Level 2 or higher, allowing them to roll for more chances at Jiyan. Between the free 5-star, these rolls, and the rest of the Lustrous Tides players receive throughout the game, no&nbsp;one should have trouble getting a solid team together for their journey in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.&nbsp;</p>

To help you do that and awaken her full potential, here’s the best Baizhi healer build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Baizhi</h2> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Thanks to her high Resonance Liberation energy cost, the best weapon for Baizhi is Variation. The 4-star rectifier is my main pick, given its ability to offer a 51.8% increase in Energy Regen (at lv.90). While at R1, Variation will also provide her with an extra 8 Concerto Energy following her Resonance Skill. <br></p>

Although its other passives won’t help Baizhi a lot, the weapon will provide the same amount of ER as Variation. To recap, here’s an overview of the best weapons for Baizhi in <em>WuWa</em>, as well as the best overall 3-star pick as an extra.</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Best Weapons for Baizhi</th><th data-align="center">Biggest Reasons Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Variation (Best in Slot)</td><td data-align="center">Will offer a 51% increase in Energy Regen and provide her with a handy amount of Concerto energy. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rectifier#25</td><td data-align="center">Offers a 51% increase in Energy Regen.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rectifier of Voyager</td><td data-align="center">Will provide a 32% increase in Energy Regen and allow her to restore an extra amount of Resonance Energy after performing her Skill.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-baizhi" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Baizhi </h2> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Baizhi in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a full 5-echo Rejuvenating Glow. The Sonata will provide her with a 10% increase in healing and allow her to provide the team with a 15% boost in ATK after each heal (cannot stack). I don’t recommend using any damage-oriented Sonata on Baizhi, as her set’s nature will cause you to waste it.</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">For the echos, go with Bell-Borne Geochelone as your main and pair it with two Elites and two Common class ones. Bell-Borne Geochelone is a must here and will allow you to grant the team both DMG and DMG Reduction buffs. When talking about the main stats for each echo, we will be prioritizing Healing Bonus, ER, and HP —the latter thanks to her set’s universal scaling. Here are the recommended stats for each pick. </p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Echo Name</th><th data-align="center">Desired Main Stat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bell-Borne Geochelone</td><td data-align="center">Healing Bonus</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Elite-class</td><td data-align="center">Energy Regen</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Elite-class</td><td data-align="center">HP or Energy Regen</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Common-class</td><td data-align="center">HP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Common-class</td><td data-align="center">HP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">For substats, prioritize Energy Regen and HP so that you can further enhance her healing and maximize her Resonance Liberation availability.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Are Baizhi’s Resonance Chain Nodes a Must?</h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">No, Baizhi can excel in her role in all stages of the game at R0. On another note, her fourth and fifth nodes are game-changers. The fourth node will increase her Remnant Entity number by two and boost their healing by 10%, while the fifth will allow her to revive one fallen teammate with full health per ten minutes. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Baizhi Teams in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">As a healer, Baizhi can fit all teams in the game without exception. Her ability to offer a 15% increase in Resonance DMG Deepen will also allow you to keep your damage up even when forced to change your premier rotation. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Given her Resonance, however, she shines the most when paired with a Glacio DPS. That is even more true if on R6, as she will be able to provide them with a 12% increase in Glacio DMG. Her ability to heal your on-field character per Heavy Attack dealt also makes her a premier pick for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/">Jiyan</a>. </p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="false">Now that you know how to build Baizhi, don’t forget to also check out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/">how to build Calcharo in Wuthering Waves</a>.</p>

If you ever wondered what they are, this is the whole list of current Ubers in the game so far.</p> <h2 id="h-all-uber-uniques-in-diablo-4" data-injectable="false">All Uber Uniques in <em>Diablo 4</em></h2> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">The following are all the Uber Uniques in<em> Diablo 4</em>. They’ll be broken down by which class can use them.</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true"> <li>Ahavarion, Spear of Lycander – Druid, Sorcerer</li> <li>Andariel’s Visage – All classes</li> <li>Doombringer – Barbarian, Necromancer, Rogue</li> <li>Harlequin Crest – All classes</li> <li>Melted Heart of Selig – All classes</li> <li>The Grandfather – Barbarian, Necromancer</li> <li>Ring of Starless Skies – All classes</li> <li>Tyrael’s Might – All Classes</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Where to get Uber Unique items</h2> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">To get Uber Uniques in <em>Diablo 4,</em> you have to farm Andariel or Duriel. They are both Uber bosses encountered at level 100, when you have the proper materials to summon them in their respective dungeons.</p> <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">&nbsp;To summon Andariel, these are the following items needed:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false"> <li>2 Pincushioned Dolls <ul> <li>Sources: The Beast in the Ice, World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> <li>2 Sancscorched Shackles <ul> <li>Sources: Lord Zir, World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="55" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">To summon Duriel, these are the following items needed:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"> <li>2 Mucus-Slick-Eggs <ul> <li>Sources: Echo of Varshan, World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-shard-of-agony-to-fight-duriel-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 Shards of Agony</a> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-summon-grigoire-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sources: Grigoire,</a> World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">If you wish to fight the Tormented version of these bosses, you will need to triple the resource count and use two Stygian Stones to summon them at their respective locations.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">In the case that you get an Uber Unique, but not the one you are looking for, you can <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-resplendent-sparks-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break this down to get Resplendent Sparks</a>.

They tend to have stats that are versatile among many builds for certain classes in <em>Diablo 4</em>. For example, if you are a Sorcerer, The Ring of Starless Skies can work with any kind of elemental or ability-specific build you’re going for. The same also goes with the Harlequin Crest.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">Drop chances are abysmal for these items and it will take you several runs to finally see one, so don’t give up. Group up with others in public lobbies to do a key share run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166235/legend-of-zelda-lego-great-deku-tree-link-minifig<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="704a0a"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094572/lego-super-mario-kart-king-boo-bowser-peachs-castle-sets-pre-order-buy-details">Nintendo</a> and Lego’s Great Deku Tree set is a two-in-one homage to two incredible Zelda games: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. The $300 kit includes 2,500 pieces that allow you to build a Great Deku Tree scene from either of the iconic games.</p>
<p id="AcOxhB">“In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from<em> Breath of the Wild</em>, as well as Link’s House from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customise their display,” Lego said in a news release. “The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.”</p>
<p id="WXnI0O">Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said Nintendo wanted the Deku Tree as the first Zelda set represented in Lego. Here’s how Lego and Nintendo describe the duality of the set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="L0xaFt">Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</p>
<p id="Ojwk9U">In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build.</p>
<p id="8QFHE6">Meanwhile, in the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</p>

  <p id="c1wQae">Making a Hollywood prequel is often seen as a studio grasping for profits or audience recognition, years after an initially successful project. There have been plenty of maligned examples over the years, like the three<em> </em>Star Wars prequel films — which are now being reconsidered as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/18/18629598/phantom-menace-star-wars-prequels-expanded-universe-best-books-tv-series-comics">enjoyable parts of a larger-than-ever galaxy</a> — or Ridley Scott’s return to the Alien universe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/26/15442036/alien-covenant-prometheus-dr-shaw-david"><em>Prometheus</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/6/15569458/review-alien-covenant"><em>Alien: Covenant</em></a>.</p>
<p id="x79w4H">The newest player in the ever-ongoing prequel IP landscape is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em></a>, which transports viewers back to George Miller’s Wasteland for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163561/furiosa-mad-max-original-1979-george-miller-movie">the origin story of the titular young warrior</a>, and her journey to becoming the fierce, fearsome Imperator we saw in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. The movie is a strange, successful journey through the Wasteland that earns its place as a necessary addition to the series — and to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23969917/best-movie-prequels-indiana-jones-alien-planet-of-the-apes">small canon of Hollywood prequels that are worth your while</a>. Let’s talk about why this prequel is valuable to fans, among so many that add little to nothing to a franchise. </p>

<p id="Le8Zty">Something that immediately marks <em>Furiosa</em> out from its fellow prequels is the fact that the story and screenplay were written before <em>Fury Road</em> even came out. “This movie was written when we were preparing <em>Fury Road</em>,” Miller explained at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">an early screening of the film in Los Angeles</a>. “We realized that because that’s a story that basically happens over three days and two nights, all the content, all the subtext, all the exposition has to be done on the run. So in order to tell it cohesively, we had to know everything that happened before, so we wrote the story of Furiosa.” </p>
<p id="f2UMt3">The screenplay that became the final film was shared with all the creative team who worked on <em>Fury Road</em>, setting up a continuity that most prequels lack, as well as an origin story that was decisively connected to the film that came before it. That’s a far cry from most modern prequels, which are usually late-stage cash grabs. <em>Furiosa</em> was always part of the <em>Fury Road</em> world, and we see that in the way the world seamlessly continues from one film to the next, and the way <em>Furiosa </em>is filled with characters and locations from <em>Fury Road</em>, like the Citadel and Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). </p>

<p id="abTh90">Furiosa’s origin didn’t move directly from behind the scenes of <em>Fury Road</em> to the new film we’re receiving this year. It was developed as a potential anime series, and the live-action movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">still carries some detail from that version</a>. It’s a great example of how the film has grown and shifted over the years, and how Miller is willing to <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road_(Collected)">envision his stories in different mediums</a>.</p>
<p id="oaFZmC">It’s worth noting that alongside that original <em>Furiosa</em> screenplay, Miller also wrote one about Max’s life leading into the film. While that story might seem like the obvious one to turn into a prequel, at the LA screening he revealed it instead became a novella called <em>The Wasteland</em>, whereas his origin about Furiosa became a full screenplay with concept art. That creative journey’s current final result is highly efficient about what Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris choose to show us, focusing on major emotional turning points in Furiosa’s life without dwelling too long on any one moment. </p>
<h2 id="OQ4icm"><strong>Furiosa is a character whose backstory is actually important</strong></h2>

<p id="aQoAQE">Charlize Theron’s performance as Furiosa was so game-changing that it reframed a decades-old franchise, revitalizing it and putting a story about a heroic woman and her quest for vengeance and justice at its center. Because we only got to spend three days with her rampaging across the Wasteland in <em>Fury Road</em>, plenty of viewers wanted more. While we’d already met Max in his three previous films, there were no other tales of Furiosa to revisit, which singles out the film as something different from, say, <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, a prequel where we already knew a lot about the main character when he was young, thanks to the original<em> </em>Star Wars trilogy. </p>
<p id="TO53in"><em>Furiosa</em> also doesn’t sweeten the character or soften her edges — unlike, for instance, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23998867/wonka-movie-review-timothee-chalamet">Paul King’s prequel <em>Wonka</em></a>, which erases all the danger and strangeness that are part and parcel with a character who’s willing to torture children to teach them moral lessons. That film recast <em>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em>’s infinitely creepy chocolatier as a sweet, charming, whimsical fellow who would be lost in the original text of Roald Dahl’s often horrifying kids’ books.</p>
<p id="8in5CP"><em>Furiosa</em>, on the other hand, isn’t aimed at kids. Its R rating and its brutal approach puts its lead through the paces, allowing her to be full of rage, fury, and violence in a way women in action cinema often aren’t afforded. </p>

<p id="AinSoC">With Hollywood’s increased reliance on VFX to alter actors’ appearances, it’s surprisingly refreshing to see Miller rely on great casting to depict Furiosa’s early years. Like River Phoenix in <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>, Alyla Browne remakes an iconic role in a convincing, memorable way, delivering fantastic scenes full of emotion.</p>
<p id="vrF63r">It’s even more impressive considering Furiosa’s notoriously sparse dialogue, with growls, grunts, and expressions telling more of Furiosa’s story than her words do. Miller pays strong attention to continuity here, with Browne as child Furiosa and Anya Taylor-Joy as young adult Furiosa clearly on the same page when it comes to how to depict the title character. The result is a seamless transition for the character from stage to stage of life, keeping the suspension of disbelief fully intact as Miller immerses us in Mad Max’s wild world.</p>
<p id="gcWIZQ">Miller has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/furiosa-director-why-he-decided-against-de-aging-charlize-theron-mad-max-prequel?utm_source=facebook%2Cthreads%2Ctwitter">referenced films</a> like <em>The Irishman and</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/2/20893933/gemini-man-review-will-smith"><em>Gemini Man</em></a> as the reasons he chose not to cast Theron in the role and use VFX on her face. Both of those films’ use of de-aging arguably distract from the story at hand, and the choice to cast Taylor-Joy keeps Furiosa from falling into the same trap. There are no surface distractions from the central story, which is lucky, as it’s stuffed with action set-pieces, unusual characters, and an emotional engine it’s not afraid to rev. </p>

<p id="HaEQCZ">Lackluster prequels often leave fans wondering, <em>Did these new details really add anything worthwhile to this world?</em> — cough, midi-chlorians, cough. But Furiosa’s brutal backstory doesn’t suffer from this predicament. Instead of defanging or overexploring Mad Max’s Wasteland, <em>Furiosa</em> expands on the long-running lore that provides intriguing new insights into different corners of the world.</p>
<p id="2SHrkO">Miller’s 1979 series launcher <em>Mad Max</em> was a tight slice of the lore and world he was introducing, and each film that came after it slightly widened that slice of the post-apocalyptic pie. In <em>Fury Road</em>,<em> </em>he expanded the world with a new set of characters and a new villain, Immortan Joe, but still kept the efficient scope of just a single wild journey over three days. With <em>Furiosa</em>,<em> </em>Miller widens the lens on the entire world over multiple years, showcasing the fragmented origins of the Wasteland and teasing just how the world ended up like this. We’re also introduced to multiple new characters and factions without any overexplanation, and they all feel like they could be ripe to explore further. </p>
<p id="CBXRIm">There’s an added contextual weight here, too, with future viewings of<em> Fury Road</em> permanently changed by the events of <em>Furiosa</em>. Glimpsing the idyllic utopia of Furiosa’s youth provides a bright spot of hope in an otherwise bleak landscape. And better understanding the Citadel’s high-stakes “guzzolene” runs gives us a unique look at both the culture and business of the terrifying desert community. <em>Furiosa</em> leaves us with a more holistic impression of life in the Wasteland and of Mad Max’s reality. </p>
<p id="zGa7b8">As Hollywood battles to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">understand and predict</a> what its audience wants in 2024, perhaps it can learn something from <em>Furiosa</em>. While it could be hard for some IP-based adaptations to go as wildly off-road as Miller does with the fifth entry in his Road Warrior franchise, they’d benefit from at least adopting some of his courage. If other prequel-makers dared to step out of the boxes they’re often squashed into — maybe introduce new characters, new eras, even a new tone to their movies, anything to make those movies matter — then “prequel” would stop being such a dispiriting word for fans of unique, innovative movies. </p>

  <p id="UnnzfD"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next major entry in Activision’s enduring military shooter franchise, will be available as part of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Game Pass subscription service</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release">day one</a>, a new trailer for the game confirms. While said trailer does not appear to include any actual gameplay from this year’s Call of Duty, it does offer the promise of much more info, which is coming on June 9.</p>
<p id="uiYlfY">That’s the Sunday when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">Activision’s new owner Microsoft</a> will hold its 2024 Xbox Games Showcase — which will be followed by another presentation, the <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Direct. Activision promises an “in-depth look at gameplay in this dark new chapter of the Black Ops series” as part of that Call of Duty livestream.</p>
<p id="GDhleA">For now, Call of Duty fans will have to settle for uncanny lookalikes and soundalikes of former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, former secretary of state Colin Powell,  former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former president of Iraq Saddam Hussein. Those political figures will play an important role in the setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which takes place during the Gulf War.</p>
<p id="U79V8v">Previous Black Ops games have featured real-world U.S. presidents, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23769879/jfk-assassination-video-games">John F. Kennedy</a> and Richard Nixon in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/call-of-duty/2020/8/27/21404151/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-footage-ronald-reagan-trailer">Ronald Reagan</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/17/21570340/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-campaign-review"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></a>. How players will interact with those early ’90s politicians remains to be seen, but we’ll find out more about the next Call of Duty soon enough.</p>
<p id="hk3vF4">Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch have been teasing their new Call of Duty in recent days, primarily with ’90s nostalgia-laden videos that set the stage for the Gulf War-era setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

<p>If you’ve been sitting and hoping for an announcement on Resident Evil 9 to happen soon, you may want to sit down for this. According to known insider Dusk Golem, the game is pretty far out.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread on Twitter</a> over the weekend, Dusk Golem say that people should “wipe the expectations of [Resident Evil 9] being announced this summer period.” He then went on to say that the game’s announcement is further away with a full release not likely until 2025 or 2026.</p>



<p>Originally, he claimed that the game was being targeted for a January 2025 release with a reveal coming “soon”. That seems to no longer be the case, and it’s something he apologized for.</p>



<p>“Sorry for the back-and-forth on that, that’s my fault,” he said. </p>



<p>As far as other games in the franchise, Dusk Golem says there’s no truth to rumors of a Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 5 remake being in development. The only remakes in development, he said, are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Veronica and Zero</a>.</p>



<p>“[Resident Evil 5] is not actively in dev now either,” he said. “It’s been funny seeing this.”</p>



<p>Despite the game’s announcement and release not coming soon, there are some things that he’s claimed about the game, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-location-to-be-set-on-an-island-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that it’ll be set on an island</a> in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>As always with rumors like these, until they are either confirmed by the studio or independently verified by Insider Gaming, please take them with a grain of salt.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-xdefiant-hits-around-8-million-unique-players-in-1-week.882918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that XDefiant has hit just shy of 8 million unique players in its first week of release.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, XDefiant has approximately 7.6 million unique players, and multiple sources expect that number to reach 8 million by the end of today.</p>



<p>Late last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> that XDefiant had seen 1 million unique players in its first 2.5 hours, making it Ubisoft’s fastest title to reach the milestone. 48 hours after launch, the game had 3 million unique players.</p>



<p>It’s understood that a ‘unique player’ means that the player has downloaded the game and opened it for the first time. The internal goal was to hit 5 million unique players within the game’s first month – a goal that has quickly been surpassed.</p>



<p>As many from our original report pointed out, unique player numbers don’t mean much in the grand scheme of things. Speaking with sources, several developers working on the project have also expressed the same sentiment, but they [developers] have said that it’s being actively addressed, with netcode being the main priority. </p>



<p>Concurrent player data, arguably the most critical metric, has reached a high of around 700,000 players, achieved on Monday, May 27th, a holiday day for many countries. But whether or not XDefiant can maintain such high player numbers remains to be seen—one thing is for certain, though: It’s an impressive statistic. </p>



<p>XDefiant is available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>The next game coming from Capcom in the Resident Evil franchise won’t be Resident Evil 9. Instead, the studio is working on remakes of Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notable leaker Dusk Golem</a>, both titles have been in development and will be the next games to release.</p>



<p>“I’ve talked to many others behind the scenes about this at this point, it’s something I heard over a year ago, think it was going to get out whether I was the one to say it or not, &amp; that’s about it,” they said.</p>



<p>Released originally for the Sega Dreamcast in 2000, Code Veronica was the first game in the series to release on a different platform before coming to PlayStation. Zero also released on a different platform first, launching in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube as an exclusive. It eventually made it’s way to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2016.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Capcom on the reports, and will update this story should a response be received.</p>

There it will share more details on the game, with a first in-depth look at gameplay “in this dark new chapter” of the Black Ops series.</p><p>Microsoft made the announcement alongside the release of a live-action reveal trailer called 'The Truth Lies'. In it we see world leaders including Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, George H. W. Bush, Colin Powell, and Saddam Hussein, delivering cryptic speeches. Black Ops 6 is reported to be set during the events of the Gulf War during the early '90s.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Live Action Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>News of Black Ops 6's release into Game Pass doesn't come as much of a surprise. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exec-suggests-call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-straight-into-game-pass">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> recently indicated all Microsoft games, including those developed by the recently acquired Activision, would launch straight into Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft has faced tough questions around the potential cannibalization effect of Game Pass, particularly on games that launch on the service day-one. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass">an interview with IGN</a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>New Call of Duty games sell for $70 and usually shift around 25 million copies, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. By releasing this year’s Call of Duty straight into Game Pass, Microsoft potentially risks cannibalizing those sales. Of course, Activision will also launch Call of Duty across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as a game that can be bought outright. But with Game Pass subscriber numbers failing to grow meaningfully Microsoft is under pressure to attract new customers. Adding a mainline Call of Duty game at launch will no doubt help with that. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> has reported Microsoft is considering raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate again.</p><p>Microsoft is in the process of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cutting 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a>. Earlier this month, the company shocked the video game world by announcing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin</a>. There are fears more cuts are to come.</p><p>Microsoft is yet to announce a release date, pricing, or platforms for Black Ops 6, but it will reportedly launch across PC, last-gen and current-gen consoles.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Fans can build a selection of their fondest moments from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild through building and exploring the depths of the Great Deku Tree. In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from Breath of the Wild, as well as Link’s House from Ocarina of Time, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customize their display. The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.</blockquote><blockquote>Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the Breath of the Wild rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the Ocarina of Time Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</blockquote><blockquote>In the Breath of the Wild version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build. </blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, in the Ocarina of Time version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the Ocarina of Time narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</blockquote><p>Eiji Aonuma, producer of The Legend of Zelda series at Nintendo, commented: “I’m really thrilled that The Legend of Zelda is joining the world of LEGO bricks, which has spurred the creative impulses of so many people of all ages.</p><p>“The Deku Tree was the first element from The Legend of Zelda we wanted to represent using LEGO bricks. This set allows you to build two different versions of the Deku Tree from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with unique features that are a great fit for the nature of the series. I can’t wait for everyone to get the chance to build this part of The Legend of Zelda world with their own hands.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>The latest GamesIndustry.biz Microcast is now available in both podcast and video form, and can be watched below.</p>

<p>This week, we discuss (to the extent that we can, given how early into the transition period we are) our change of ownership with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">IGN parent Ziff Davis acquiring Gamer Network Ltd</a> and its brands, which includes <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> and our sister sites Eurogamer, VG247, Rock Paper Shotgun and more.</p>
<p>We also talk about the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo">new leadership at Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Games</a> as well as the studio's ambitions for the future, which you can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard">read more about in Chris' interview on the site</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, we reflect on the impact of the other acquisitions announced last week; namely, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-switch-port-specialist-shiver-entertainment-from-embracer">Nintendo taking Shiver Entertainment</a> off Embracer Group's hands, and Atari ending the first console war by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">snapping up the Intellivision brand</a>.</p>

        <p>Money raised will fund development of its forthcoming VR combat title</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Toronto-based Sinn Studio has raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by Hartmann Capital.</p>
<p>The funds will go towards building technology to support its next real-time PvP VR combat game, which is currently in development.</p>
<p>The studio also received contributions from Boost VC, Republic, Alumni Ventures, Mana Ventures, MetaVision, and other angel investors including Uken Games CEO Chris Ye.</p>
<p>"We spent seven years surviving the ups and downs of VR as a bootstrapped company, waiting for that industry-defining moment, and the right partners to commit to our first fundraiser," said Sinn Studio co-founder and CEO Alek Sinn.</p>
<p>"We're incredibly grateful to Hartmann Capital and everyone else who joined our seed round for their belief in our mission to redefine the future of combat in this exciting new era of spatial computing."</p>
<p>Sinn Studio was co-founded in 2017 by Alek Sinn and Almir Brljak, and has since grown to become a team of 30 employees.</p>
<p>It launched its first title Swordsman in 2020 on Steam, which was later released on Quest, Pico, and PSVR 2.</p>

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch</a>, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one</a>.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game yet, but <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-featured-at-xboxs-summer-showcase">two live-action teasers</a> have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say,&nbsp;"The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.</p>

<p>It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-followed-by-a-secret-direct-for-a-beloved">the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase</a>.</p>
