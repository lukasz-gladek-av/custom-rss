<p>Drop in this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The legendary skater <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk</a> is back this week and this time he's revisiting the third and fourth games across all platforms including the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Returning skaters can expect to drop into both new and old parks – shredding up places like the Foundry, Alcatraz, College and new locations like an <em>entire</em> pinball machine. On top of this are new and returning cast members, as well as multiple modes to work your way through.</p>
<p>The reviews for this anticipated release are now rolling in and while we should hear more about the Nintendo versions later this week, we've now got the first lot of impressions to give us an idea of how the game is performing so far. Here's the round up:</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182162 @ 1751942683 -->
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">GameSpot</a> has given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> <strong>8/10</strong> and although it's "still the best skateboarding gameplay around" it's not all that happy about the decisions made with the fourth outing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a phenomenal game of skate, one that fans would flock to without hesitation if it weren't for some of the strange decisions regarding the game's Career mode and THPS 4 levels. Some of the changes feel needless, and overall, THPS 4 just doesn't fit as well into the same structure as the original three games...Once the initial disappointment fades, however, you're left with a remake that still handles as well as these games ever have, and that's something that's worth playing no matter who you are."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">IGN</a> also settled on a score of <strong>8/10</strong> - calling it a "largely successful rejuvenation" of the 2001 and 2002 originals, despite the changes to the fourth outing's formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THPS 3 + 4 proves again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless and remains suitable for all skill levels...However, syncing THPS4 with the classic two-minute timer of the initial trilogy is probably going to be a sore point with fans who strongly regard the series’ fourth installment as their favourite, and discarding a whopping 80% of the original THPS3 and THPS4 soundtracks is a startlingly naive choice to make about such a famously crucial component of those games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review-spine-transfer-into-a-new-old-format/">GamingTrend</a> awarded it <strong>85/100</strong>, noting how it doesn't nail it "perfectly" but it's still a lot of fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 lands somewhere between remake and reimagining. It doesn’t land either perfectly, but it's still a ton of fun. There’s a lot to see and do"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/07/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-review/">But Why Tho?</a> gave it <strong>9/10</strong>, mentioning how it breathes new life into this classic series once again but seemingly wasn't impacted by the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The skating itself is the best it has ever been. <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> is even smoother and more refined than its predecessor, making the skating action as lifelike as possible. Landing tricks feel fluid, and although it takes a while to master, it is pretty simple to pick up and play. There are special tricks that can be unlocked and assigned to skaters as well, scoring significantly more points than your average trick."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/skating-it-safe">Game Informer</a> gave the Birdman's new game <strong>8/10</strong>, but left it wanting a little more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Iron Galaxy has excellently modernized the gameplay and graphics of these classics to feel right in 2025, I wish it had done a better job of highlighting the influence these games once had in their heyday."</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week’s massive layoffs at Microsoft--<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and Xbox in particular</a>--was terrible for all kinds of reasons. Careers were upended (or even ended) for the workers and couples and families and friendships involved, with lives thrown into turmoil and months or even years of work thrown in the bin. For the wider gaming public,<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it means Xbox will have less studios releasing fewer games</a>.</p><p>As the dust has settled on the layoffs, we keep learning more and more about them, and the more we learn the more awful they become.<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Stuff like the number of veterans affected, some with more experience than many of you have lived years on this Earth</a>. Or, as I discovered over the weekend, that Microsoft has (like many other gaming and tech companies) found new and innovative ways to fuck their workers over.</p><p>More and more companies around the world, but particularly in the United States, like to offer shares as a 'bonus' to their employees, an extension of their overall compensation. Come and work for us, this says, and keep working for us, and you'll be a part of the company not just on the timesheet but, in some small way, in terms of ownership as well. When it comes to companies like Microsoft, that can be a big deal; at time of posting, a single share in Xbox's parent company is worth $500.</p><p>There's a catch with these shares, though.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> They're usually unvested, which means that while you're <em>kinda </em>given them when you join, you don't <em>actually </em>get to sell them until they become vested stocks at a later time, often after years of service</a>. It's commonly known as a pair of "golden handcuffs", with<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the technical term being RSUs, or Restricted Stock Units</a>. And, surprising absolutely nobody, many of those affected by the Xbox layoffs last week had unvested shares.</p><p>So when they were laid off, they didn't get to keep those shares, or at least didn't get to keep most of them (sometimes workers are granted a certain percentage per year), a loss which in some cases (and depending on seniority and bonuses) could have been worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. Instead, all these shares go right back to Microsoft, where they can be sold off to millionaires, billionaires or redistributed to the company's senior leadership.</p><p>As someone who works for a co-op website, and who has previously only worked for a small media company and the NSW Government, last week I had very little knowledge about this concept, so how it affected laid-off employees never even occurred to me. Until I saw a Linkedin post by Noble Smith, who had worked on everything from <em>Killer Instinct</em> to <em>Age of Empires</em> at Xbox, and who shared his story of thinking he had enough Microsoft stock to afford to put his "kids through college", but ended up losing it all when he was laid off in 2023:</p><blockquote><div><p>What happens to all of that unvested stock from the 9,000 people who were just laid off from Microsoft?</p><p>Well, the corporation gets to take it back.</p><p>Poof! Like a conjuror's trick. That promised payment for all your hard work is gone.</p><p>Xbox doesn't pay royalties to people who work on its games. Executives like Matt Booty tell Xbox workers in company meetings (whenever he is asked if Xbox will someday pay out royalties) that your royalty equivalents are the stock shares that you are granted at your signing and any stock shares granted as bonuses.</p><p>Great health insurance and the promise of yearly stock vesting: The twin rings in the Microsoft golden handcuffs. But when you're laid off that stock is as insubstantial as a dream. (And once your COBRA runs out, that amazing healthcare is an apparition too.)</p><p>I lost a small amount of unvested stock when I was laid off from Xbox in 2023. Small by normal standards. But enough to put my kids through college. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, even a measly 10 shares is worth close to five thousand dollars. A lot of people who got laid off each had hundreds if not thousands of unvested shares.</p><p>And now Microsoft gets to reabsorb all of that vast wealth. Hundreds of millions of dollars? Billions?</p><p>Their coffers runneth over.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>"Microsoft actually did a great job letting you know exactly how many shares were granted, vested and unvested", Smith explained in a conversation with me. "That said, one of the most aggravating things about working there was the constant dangling carrot of those unvested shares. People might think that Microsoft just gives out heaps of stock to employees. Nope. Only if you’re at the executive level. The rest of us grunts had to work HARD to earn our shares. If the annual review cycle came along and you didn’t earn a stock award that year it was crushing."</p><p>"People at Microsoft look at their vesting schedules a lot!", he adds. "Those shares are your kids’ college tuition, or part of your retirement nest egg, or maybe even a down payment on a house. And it hurts when you get laid off with unvested shares that you had earned…but weren’t given enough time as an employee to finally receive."</p><p>I shared Smith's story on social media because the concept blew my socks clean off, and have since heard from many other former Xbox employees, employees of Xbox-owned studios and workers from other major video game companies that stuff like this is pretty common in the AAA space.</p><p>An employee at Bethesda, for example, says that despite the company being bought by Microsoft over four years ago, their promised shares are only just now materialising, and aren't even being <em>given </em>at all. Workers can purchase shares for a 10% discount, but then have to pay tax on them, which in the end works out to be a pretty bum deal.</p><p>Former workers at Bungie and EA (and EA-owned studios like Bioware) tell me they were also promised shares upon starting in their jobs, but upon being laid off--sometimes after <em>years </em>of employment--these had yet to vest, meaning they ended up worthless.</p><p>This is bullshit! To promise some ethereal form of compensation then so routinely (and cruelly) have it disappear in a puff of smoke leaving employees with <em>nothing</em>, sounds to someone from outside the US like it should be illegal. Especially since those shares just revert back to the company and ultimately end up in the hands of those who have, in some way (whether as an executive or a shareholder), contributed to the layoffs in the first place!</p><p>If you've ever experienced something like this in the video game industry and would like your story added to this piece, or have more details on Microsoft's policies with specifics to seniority and tenure, <a href="mailto:luke@aftermath.site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please get in touch</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> will send players to explore a new planet called Kairos. A previous trailer introduced the game's villain, the Timekeeper, and his minions. Now, the Borderlands 4 dev team is sharing a closer look at Kairos itself, as well as the various factions who live there.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkOMX7MoZW4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FkOMX7MoZW4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As mentioned in the video, Kairos is a prison planet that's been ruled by the Timekeeper for a long time. The Timekeeper's control over the population may not be absolute, but he still possesses the technology to oppress the people and see through their eyes at his whim.</p><p>Most of the new factions introduced in the video have their own reasons to hate the Timekeeper. The lone exception so far is Idolater Sol of the Fadefields. He's been exiled from the capital city and Sol is eager to get back in the Timekeeper's good graces and prove his worth after the players' party arrives on the planet. The other factions may oppose the Timekeeper, but there's no guarantee they'll be on the side of the player.</p><p>Narrative director Sam Winkler recently disclosed that Borderlands 4 is introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-introduces-its-best-feature-yet-a-claptrap-volume-slider/1100-6532865/" data-ref-id="1100-6532865">a volume control for Claptrap</a>. In other words, you can finally make Claptrap shut up. The dev team has indicated that Kairos is a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">seamless world</a>" that won't be bogged down by load screens while players explore the planet. Players will also be able to replay previously completed missions.</p><p>Gearbox has promised that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-more-skills-per-character-than-the-last-two-main-games-combined/1100-6532628/" data-ref-id="1100-6532628">are more skills per character</a> than the last two games combined. Borderlands 4 is also slated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/thanks-to-borderlands-4-fans-this-handy-feature-has-been-added-to-the-game/1100-6532580/" data-ref-id="1100-6532580">introduce a radar feature</a>, which has been requested by fans for a long time.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12. A port for Switch 2 will be coming a little further down the line.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/">rumors and reports</a> that pointed to the contrary, Romero Games is in fact still kicking, though things are still touch and go as the team is forced to "reassess the staffing of [the] studio."</p><p dir="ltr">Romero Games, founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, was deep in development on its latest game when its publisher suddenly pulled funding from the project last week, causing the game to be cancelled and casting a shadow on the future of the Galway-based team. In a statement shared to Romero Games' social media pages on July 7, the studio clarified a lot of the questions surrounding its future and the unfortunate cancellation.</p><p dir="ltr">The short post claims that the team's project did lose funding last week, putting the team in a difficult spot. Due to the nature of the deal, Romero Games cannot reveal the publisher that pulled the team's funding, but as news of layoffs and similar cancellations across several Xbox studios continued to trickle out last week, it was largely believed to be Microsoft. Romero Games' post suggests that "some may infer [the publisher's identity] from public information."</p><p dir="ltr">In a spot of good news however, it also states that interested parties have reached out to Romero Games in order to potentially "bring the game across the finish line." Crucially, it also makes clear that Romero Games is still open, and that the team was even in the studio as recently as July 7 to discuss possible next steps.</p><p dir="ltr">Romero Games was established in 2015 and has released a number of games since its inception, including the mods Sigil and its sequel Sigil II, which serve as unofficial continuations for DOOM, the foundational FPS which John Romero helped create during his time at id Software. The team most recently developed Empire of Sin, a strategy game set in the Prohibition era and published by Paradox Interactive, and was working on a new FPS before the waves at Microsoft seemingly ended the game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Microsoft executed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">another mass round of layoffs</a>, culminating in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">closure of The Initiative</a> and the cancellation of projects like Perfect Dark and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/">new MMO from the team behind Elder Scrolls Online</a>. The cuts are believed to target about 9,000 employees across Microsoft's portfolio, and a lot of teams working under the Xbox banner, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10</a>, were heavily impacted by the layoffs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-no-reason-to-keep-putting-up-with-microsoft.1237755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some moments force you to step back and take stock of a situation, and last week was as good (read: bad) as any: Microsoft announced that it’s<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laying off another 9,000 people</a>, many of them in games. Meanwhile, Windows has been repeatedly enshittified, Office sucks, Xbox is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everywhere and nowhere all at once</a>, and the company is forcing AI down everybody’s throats, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ai-is-no-longer-optional-microsoft-is-allegedly-pressuring-employees-to-use-ai-tools-through-manager-evaluations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including those of its remaining employees</a>. It is also <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aiding and abetting a genocide in Gaza</a> via its Azure cloud and AI services. Nobody asked for this, and we don’t have to put up with it.</p><p>Recently, Luke argued that Microsoft should try <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off one person</a>, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, instead of thousands. I don’t hate this idea! But I also immediately saw people reply to Luke’s piece by saying that Xbox president Sarah Bond and/or Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty are the real problem; Spencer is merely the smug face of this flailing operation. That in mind, I come to you with a slightly different argument: No matter who’s in charge, there’s no salvaging Microsoft or Xbox. The entire enterprise is rotten to the core.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we keep our focus squarely on games, we’re talking about a behemoth that chose to scoop up a mindbogglingly large chunk of fertile game development soil. Recent standouts include the entirety of Activision Blizzard (an operation spanning well over 20 studios), all of Zenimax/Bethesda (which includes subsidiaries like id Software and Arkane), Double Fine, Obsidian, and inXile – all with no apparent long-term plan beyond digging a very deep hole. The story of Microsoft’s tenuous grip on third place has <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been the games</a>; instead, it’s one of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cuts</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>OK, that’s not entirely fair. Microsoft did sort of have a plan: Game Pass, a subscription service that was supposed to become the Netflix of games, but which so far has yet to transform the gaming landscape the way the latter did for TV and film. What if it did, though? What was the long-term play? Arkane founder (and current WolfEye Studios creative director) Raphael Colantonio recently summed it up by declaring the whole enterprise “unsustainable,” echoing a sentiment shared by many in the industry <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-of-games-a-threat-to-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for years</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] ‘infinite money,’ but at some point reality has to hit," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941512826687980019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has proven <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesitant to publicly admit</a> what common sense would infer to be true: Games included in a relatively cheap – <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though increasingly expensive</a> – subscription package sell less. Microsoft, meanwhile, insists that Game Pass is at least profitable on its own terms, but Colantonio believes otherwise.</p><p>"Game Pass is only [profitable] if you ignore the 100 billions that MS spent in acquiring content for GP such as Zenimax and Activision," he <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941599266004259310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Game Business’ Chris Dring added another layer to this dynamic: “I asked for clarification on the 'Game Pass is profitable' claim, and was told no first-party costs are included,” he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation [to third-party studios on Game Pass], that profitability might not be correct.”</p><p>All of which is to say: Outside of funding indies – money that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be drying up</a> – Microsoft’s presence has in the long run proven actively detrimental to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-delay-doesnt-mean-the-games-industrys-in-trouble-its-already-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what remains of the video game industry</a>, in some ways by design. As massive mega-corporations are wont to do, it viewed games as a spigot from which to fill its buckets with capital. The drought it left in its wake – closed studios, laid off employees, a dearth of future opportunities, and a less functional approach to game sales – would be none of its concern. And what do we have to show for it? A first-party slate that, outside of gems like <em>Avowed</em>, is more defined by misses (<em>Crackdown 3</em>), curious absences (<em>Fable</em>), and cancellations (<em>Scalebound</em>, <em>Everwild</em>, <em>Perfect Dark</em>) than anything resembling hits.</p><p>There’s just no reason to support Microsoft’s gaming endeavors at this point. It’s had plenty of time to get things right; it’s not going to. The company’s other endeavors aren’t looking great, either. I’m not saying you’ve got to uninstall Windows right this second, but there’s a wider, better world out there than the misanthropic product universe Microsoft would very much like us all to remain confined to. The best time to start divesting from Microsoft was years ago, or when its products first began sustaining Israel’s endless assault on Palestinians, or yesterday.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The anime and manga industry might not flaunt romances between its creators, but it certainly has its share of “it couples.” Arguably, the most beloved is the duo of <a href="https://x.com/catsuka/status/1882592418966675501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hunter X Hunter’s </em>Yoshihiro Togashi and<em> Sailor Moon’s </em>Naoko Takeuchi</a>. But during Anime Expo and Japan Expo weekend, I witnessed a quieter but equally powerful couple in <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno and his wife, acclaimed manga artist <a href="https://myanimelist.net/people/2340/Moyoco_Anno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moyoco</a>, who showed off their bond in the most anime way imaginable: having Hideaki’s Studio Khara produce an animated short honoring the 20th anniversary of Moyoco's magical girl series, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-04/moyoco-anno-sugar-sugar-rune-manga-gets-new-anime-projects/.226309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Khara’s release of a CG prologue of <em>Sugar Sugar Rune</em>— directed by <em>Evangelion: 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon A Time</em> CG director Yusuke Matsui—came with the announcement of the series getting a full anime adaptation. But as far as I and my Twitter timeline were concerned, the real headline wasn’t the adaptation. It was Hideaki being anime’s reigning “wife guy.” What I didn’t realize at the time though was that this sweet gesture was just one of many adorable, deeply supportive moments the Annos have shared over their 23-year marriage. Turns out, the couple’s love story has been quietly unfolding like a real life slice-of-life series, and they might just be my new favorite couple in the industry.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『シュガシュガルーン』連載20周年記念短編映像「SUGAR SUGAR RUNE　Les deux sorcières」（ シュガシュガルーン  レ・ドゥー・ソルシエール）" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qidzapjAMVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In my own sleuthing on the couple over the weekend as Aftermath’s resident anime correspondent, I stumbled across this gem of a Twitter post. It referenced an old interview with Hideaki Anno, where he was asked about his ideal woman. Without hesitation, he simply replied, “My wife, of course.”</p><p>While this answer was the best he could have given, it hit me a little harder than I expected.&nbsp;Anno, like his mentor Hayao Miyazaki, is often reduced online to a caricature of himself—a brooding auteur with a mecha fixation and a backlog of unresolved self-esteem issues poured especially thick into <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Shinji Ikari.&nbsp;</p><p>This was something else. This was the sign of a man who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideaki-anno-the-final-challenge-of-evangelion-is-the-inside-look-into-anime-creation-fans-need/1100-6495833/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">routinely oscillates between perfectionism and overwork</a> being visibly healed by his partner’s love. Somewhat tastelessly, some fans have joked about Moyoco needing to divorce him or something so his downward depressive spiral would yield another work like <em>Eva</em>, missing the entire point of how their partnership gave way to the rehabilitating theme of the <em>Rebuild </em>movies. The remakes of <em>Evangelion</em>’s narrative in movie form immortalized Anno’s love for Moyoco through <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Mari_Makinami_Illustrious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mari Illustrious Makinami. </a><a href="https://note.com/anno_moyoco/n/n5d5c137b64ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite Moyoco and Khara’s pushing back</a> on Mari being literally Moyoco, she is still <em>a lot</em> like Moyoco.</p><p>On a surface level, Mari’s addition to the sequel-meets-remake animated films disrupted the long-standing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/9u7ybg/rei_vs_asuka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rei vs Asuka</a> discourse <em>Eva </em>fans are still debating over (<a href="https://youtu.be/abnEeNWxzNM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the correct answer is Misato</a>). However, knowing the real-life inspiration behind Mari makes her role resonate differently with me now. It’s not a stretch to see Shinji as a stand-in for Hideaki himself—an emotionally withdrawn guy burdened by legacy and locked in a strained relationship with his father. And then Mari comes parachuting into his life (<a href="https://youtu.be/4qK87ftbU5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literally</a>). She’s bold, irreverent, blunt, and tonally different from anything in the series. She doesn’t just shift the narrative into uncharted waters; she shifts its emotional current for the better as a chaotic symbol of new transformation breaking through the static of an otherwise doomed narrative.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Evangelion 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time ENDING" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMmcwrb8OIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In <em>Thrice Upon a Time</em>, Mari is the one who reaches out to a once-doomed kid along the way with gentle nudges as he finally makes peace with his father and steps into adulthood. Given that Mari was modeled after Moyoco, its ending, which shows the two as grown-ups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMmcwrb8OIs&amp;pp=ygUkdGhyaWNlIHVwb24gYSB0aW1lIGV2YW5nZWxpb24gZW5kaW5n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving a train station hand in hand</a>, becomes even more meaningful. It also helps that his wife was a <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/3786/Shin_Evangelion_Movie_%7C%7C/characters#staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character designer for the film</a> and is a <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/info-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing director at Khara</a> alongside Anno’s friends <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-kazuya-tsurumaki-interview-2000593812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki</a>, Hiroyasu Kobayashi, and Nobuo Kawakami.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Characters from "Neon Genesis Evangelion" drawn by Moyoco Anno (Happy Mania, Sugar Sugar Rune,...) who is also Hideaki Anno's wife. <a href="https://t.co/6uht0UJ1nM">pic.twitter.com/6uht0UJ1nM</a></p>— Otaking 🇵🇸 (@TheOtaking) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOtaking/status/1533526622057422851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Hideaki and Moyoco’s love is a collaborative and creative two-way street. Beyond drawing her take on <em>Eva</em>'s<em> </em>characters and <a href="https://x.com/anno_moyoco/status/765873763850125313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actors in <em>Shin Godzilla</em></a>, Moyoco has also pulled a page from <a href="https://x.com/ShinEyeZehUhh/status/1846632512044351530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takeuchi’s playbook</a> in penning an autobiographical manga called <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-02-16/moyoco-anno-insufficient-direction-manga-launches-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Insufficient Direction</em></a>. In it, she chronicles the quirks and joys of being married to Hideaki. My favorite moments from the manga was when she revealed that Anno wore <em>Kamen Rider</em> cosplay at their wedding, and that she helped him overcome his picky eating tendencies by introducing zucchini into his diet.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world where Hideaki is so often reduced to a creative who's at his best when he’s going through it like anime’s Adele, it’s genuinely heartwarming to see a different portrait emerge online of him, one which paints him in a softer hue. What’s more, Moyoco didn’t just “fix” Hideaki, as many have joked about online. As she notes, being with him helped her embrace her otaku soul. For me, their relationship is a rare kind of alchemy where their personal and professional lives manage to converge in ways that are equally healing and wildly creative.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy]]></content:encoded>

Luckily, there’s good news: starting at 7PM Eastern today, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.walmart.com" rel="sponsored">Walmart Plus</a> members will be able to purchase Nintendo’s latest handheld console — either the standalone Switch 2 or the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle — through its website. The restock is happening just before its Walmart Deals event begins on July 8th; the event lasts through July 13th.</p><p>The <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">standalone Switch 2</a> will go for $449 from Walmart.

The bundle includes everything that comes with the Nintendo Switch 2 — a dock, a pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers, etc. — as well as a download code for a digital copy of the new <em>Mario Kart</em> game (valued at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280%2F" rel="sponsored">$79.99</a>).

It also features an improved U-shaped kickstand, 256GB of internal storage, and a pair of magnetic Joy-Con 2 controllers, which offer mouse-like functionality in select games and a new “C” button that provides quick access to Nintendo’s in-game voice and text chat feature, GameChat. The redesigned dock, meanwhile, features a built-in ethernet port and two USB-A ports.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/685578/nintendo-switch-2-restock-walmart-availability]]></content:encoded>

That cooling attention is having ripple effects, especially for high-rarity cards. While Special Illustration Rare (SIR) ex cards are seeing a notable drop in value, several Illustration Rares are climbing fast, in part due to shifting collector interest and low inventory levels in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this shift echoes the rise of <em>Groudon</em> IR from earlier this year, where unexpected demand met low availability. Now other Illustration Rare cards are following suit, gaining ground while their flashier SIR counterparts take a dip.

Surging Sparks is going through a sharp correction, with top cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 247/191</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydreigon ex - 240/191</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milotic ex - 237/191</a> dropping 51%, 34%, and 26% respectively. Even chase cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 238/191</a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latias ex - 239/191</a> are down over 20%. But this isn’t a crash, it’s a natural correction driven by rising supply.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, Crown Zenith is heating up fast. Cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina VSTAR - GG69/GG70</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR - GG68/70</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR - GG67/70</a> have surged 17%–24% in just days. Even <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG70</a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arceus VSTAR - GG70/GG70</a> are gaining ground. With the Scarlet and Violet era wrapping up and Mega Evolution returning soon, Sword and Shield sets like Crown Zenith are entering that sweet spot where older modern sets start gaining long-term value. I’m buying into both while the market is still adjusting.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy Japanese Pokémon Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-japan-black-bolt-and-white-flare-most-expensive">Japanese Pokémon TCG</a> booster boxes have far better odds at pulling chase cards, have far less bulk and are often half the price of English booster boxes. This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget? Go for Japanese cards.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs Right Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to envy those with deep pockets grabbing the priciest Pokémon TCG cards, there’s something way more exciting about pulling a massive hit straight from a booster pack, especially with sets like <em>Destined Rivals</em>, <em>Prismatic Evolutions</em>, <em>Twilight Masquerade</em>, and <em>Surging Sparks</em> still in print. Right now, cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon ex - 161/131</a> are leading the market at over $1,000, followed by heavy hitters like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greninja ex - 214/167</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan’s Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</a>, all pushing $300+. The iconic <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 238/191</a> has cooled to around $295 after peaking last year, making it a solid buy. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More fan-favorite chase cards include <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roaring Moon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latias ex</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Rocket’s Moltres ex</a>, all hovering between $195–$260. And then there’s the Eeveelution invasion. <em>Prismatic Evolutions</em> is packed with top-tier art like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylveon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leafeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vaporeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon ex</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glaceon ex</a>, all sitting comfortably above $230. Each card is absolutley stunning, pumped with nostalgia and some competitive utility to boot (Although I'd suggest getting the standard ex cards for you deck). The odds of pulling them are slim, Prismatic Evolution is notoriously unforgiving with pull rates. Buying singles might be the smarter move if you're after specific cards, but I also don't like having fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Epic Games, buoyed by the massive success of Fortnite, has spent the last few years throwing elbows in the mobile industry to get its app store on more phones. It scored an antitrust win against Google in late 2023, and the following year it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-coordinated-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict/">went after Samsung</a> for deploying "Auto Blocker" on its Android phones, which would make it harder for users to install the Epic Games Store. Now, the parties have settled the case just days before Samsung will unveil its latest phones.</p>
<p>The Epic Store drama began several years ago when the company defied Google and Apple rules about accepting outside payments in the mega-popular <em>Fortnite</em>. Both stores pulled the app, and Epic sued. Apple emerged victorious, with <em>Fortnite</em> only returning to the iPhone recently. Google, however, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">lost the case</a> after Epic showed it worked behind the scenes to stymie the development of app stores like Epic's.</p>
<p>Google is still working to avoid penalties in that long-running case, but Epic thought it smelled a conspiracy last year. It filed a similar lawsuit against Samsung, accusing it of implementing a feature to block third-party app stores. The issue comes down to the addition of a feature to Samsung phones called Auto Blocker, which is similar to Google's new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/android-16-review-post-hype/">Advanced Protection in Android 16</a>. It protects against attacks over USB, disables link previews, and scans apps more often for malicious activity. Most importantly, it blocks app sideloading. Without sideloading, there's no way to install the Epic Games Store or any of the content inside it.</p>

For now, Romero Games is seeking a new publisher to bring its game past the finish line. According to the statement, “several” publishers have reached out to the company about seeing the game through, and the team is “evaluating” its options. So while nothing’s set in stone, it does seem like there’s a chance that some interested party or parties will help salvage the game after Microsoft pulled out of the deal. (The statement itself says it cannot name the publisher due to “confidentiality agreements,” but members of the studio have already stated publicly that they were caught up in the layoffs at Microsoft.)</p><p>Hopefully, whatever Romero Games is working on sees the light of day.

No reason was given for why that didn’t work out. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has now broken his silence, shedding some potential light on a power struggle facing one of 2025's most-anticipated PC releases. </p><p>“We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it,” he wrote on Reddit on Monday. “And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.” </p><p>According to Cleveland, the sudden upheaval came as a shock. The underwater survival exploration sim was set to come to Steam Early Access at some point later this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479">but as we reported last week</a></span> the cryptic press release from Krafton suggested that might no longer be the case. It alluded to quality controls and a milestone process needed to ensure the game meets player expectations. </p><p>“As part of its oversight, Krafton is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios,” the publisher wrote. “These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.”<br></p><p>Reading between the lines of Cleveland’s Reddit post, it sounds like there was a fundamental disagreement over whether to ship sooner and get<em> Subnautica 2</em> into players’ hands for feedback, or wait  potentially until 2026 to make the game playable to the public. Cleveland and the others sold Unknown Worlds to Krafton in 2021, at which time the publisher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed it would</a></span> continue to “function as an independent game development studio.” I guess in 2025 that means independently of the co-founders.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-1851785764]]></content:encoded>

That led to dinosaurs being brought to the mainland, off their island habitat, and eventually spreading around the world. It was a cool idea that <em>Jurassic World Dominion,</em> the last film in the franchise, never did much with. Dinosaurs spreading around the world is a bonkers idea that could provide you with endless storylines, scenarios, and moments to build movies and TV shows around. That could power 20 years of storytelling. </p><h2 id="h18231"><a id=""></a>Rebooting <em>Jurassic Park</em></h2><p>Sadly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033"><em>Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>tosses that all out the window, reminding viewers four separate times in the opening half hour that dinosaurs can’t survive on modern Earth and most of them are now dead. The survivors can be found on some islands dotted around the equator, but that’s it. </p><p>We do get one scene <em>very </em>early into <em>Rebirth </em>that features a big brontosaurus stuck in New York City, covered in graffiti and trash and causing a traffic jam. The movie then swiftly moves on, but not before reminding you one more time that they are all dead and this big dinosaur is probably the last one in North America. </p><p>So, after essentially retconning the end of the<em> Jurassic World</em> trilogy, what does <em>Rebirth </em>do? It fires up a plot that has nothing to do with the rest of the world and takes place on an island. So why the retcon? Your guess is as good as mine! </p><p>Anyway, <em>Rebirth’s </em>plot involves mercenaries (led by Scarlett Johansson) heading to a top-secret island where dinosaur experiments happened, so they can grab some prehistoric blood samples from massive beasts for a rich pharmaceutical company that wants to make a new heart disease medication that will bring in trillions of dollars. </p><h2 id="h18232"><a id=""></a>Prehistoric questing</h2><p>This half of the movie is where a lot of the dinosaur action happens, and director Gareth Edwards knows how to put together intense, action-packed prehistoric setpieces. One sequence involving large flying dinosaurs and a giant rock cliff is a standout moment. But whenever there aren’t dinos on screen, the mercs’ plotline feels like a boring video game fetch quest.</p><p>Get three DNA samples from these big creatures, each in a different biome, and bring them back to get your reward. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876">Most of them are killed off</a></span> before you can care, and the one death that does leave an impact is undone to provide a nice, happy ending, though fans of corporate assholes getting their comeuppance will be satisfied by one late kill in the movie. </p><p>The other half of <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> involves a small family: A dad, his young daughter, his older daughter who leaves for college soon, and her lazy boyfriend. It’s here that<em> Rebirth</em> really shines, as the family members actually have character arcs and change as the movie goes on. The film’s script, while filled with some dumb moments, does a great job of fleshing the family out and making you care about them. When they were in danger,  I was sitting upright and hoping they’d all make it out alive. </p><h2 id="h18233"><a id=""></a>A mutated, hybrid narrative</h2><p>These two halves of the movie barely interact with each other. The family and mercs crash into each other at the start, but then spend 60 percent of the runtime separated, their paths only merging in the last 25 minutes or so.</p><p>This is when <em>Rebirth’s </em>mutant hybrid dinosaurs become a big threat to the family and the mercenaries. Sadly, because they are featured in the film so briefly, neither the raptor-like Mutadon nor the massive mutated T-Rex, known as a D-Rex, makes much of an impact. Their designs are strange and disturbing, but unlike <em>Jurassic World’</em>s now-iconic Indominus Rex, which played a huge part in that film, neither of these mutants is going on my list of favorite movie monsters. </p><p>As <em>Rebirth </em>wrapped up, and the familiar<em> Jurassic Park</em> music played over the survivors leaving dino island, I felt conflicted. I’m always down for dinosaurs, and the CG beasts in <em>Rebirth </em>are the best-looking in the franchise. And damn scary, too. But <em>Rebirth’s </em>two plotlines don’t come together well, and so I ended up hating one half of the movie  for getting in the way of the other. </p><p>The end result is, ironically, a strange, mutated hybrid of a movie that is mostly enjoyable if you don’t think too hard about what’s happening on screen. In other words, it’s another <em>Jurassic Park</em> sequel.

			<p>When Microsoft laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 people last week</a>, a significant portion of its gaming business was also impacted, even studios Microsoft didn't own. Romero Games, the studio founded by DOOM creator John Romero, had its funding cut due to the layoffs and cuts at Microsoft,<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/"> resulting in its project being cancelled</a>. After developers from the team reported that they had lost their jobs at Romero Games, it was believed that the studio had also closed down due to the loss of funding. </p>



<p>That's not the case, according to Romero Games, who published a new statement today on its social media channels. The studio did not deny that it had to make cuts to staff, and reiterates that the loss of funding resulted in the game it was developing being cancelled. But it refutes any claims that the studio had closed.</p>



<p>"<em>Romero Games is not closed</em>," the statement reads<em>, "and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that. Indeed, we were in the studio today to discuss next steps with the team</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also goes on to say that since the layoffs at Microsoft and Romero Games' project being cancelled, it has been in contact with "<em>several publishers</em>" who could potentially help bring the game they were working on back to life. The studio is "<em>currently evaluating those opportunities</em>."</p>







<p>At least there's still a chance for Romero Games to pick up where it left off, with this loss of funding potentially being nothing more than a speedbump on the studio's road to completing development on its current project. Hopefully that's how it looks in hindsight in the near future, when we're all playing whatever Romero Games has been cooking up.</p>

</ul><p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/rzbpqwiz/the-horus-heresy-round-table-the-origins-of-saturnine-armour/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop posted an interview about the Warhammer: The Horus Heresy Saturnine army box. In it, they discussed the new addition of the Saturnine Terminator armor. In the interview, it was mentioned that the armor has been in development for a while; it has even popped up in expanded media material before this point.</p>

<p>The developers even mention an earlier version of the armor was repurposed as the Indomitus Terminator pattern from the 1980s edition of <em>Space Hulk</em>.</p>

<p>Since T<em>he Horus Heresy</em> is a quasi-historical period, an extended prequel of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000</em></a>, this attention to detail was important on the developer's part. Expressing the power of these Terminator armors while within the restraints of technology at the time. As for how these details will gel with the latest edition's new mechanics remains to be seen.</p>

Nearly everyone between the ages of 6 and 86 knows how Peter Parker became Spider-Man, how a billionaire orphan turned into Batman, and how an abandoned alien from Krypton became Superman. If those origins were questioned on <em>Jeopardy!</em>, they wouldn’t be worth any more than $100. That cultural ubiquity is exactly why Gunn <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Times</em></a></span> he has no interest in movies wasting time telling a story we’ve all known for decades.</p><p>“I don’t need to see pearls in a back alley when Batman’s parents are killed. I don’t need to see the radioactive spider biting Spider-Man. And I don’t need to see baby Kal coming from Krypton in a little baby rocket. We have watched a million movies with characters who don’t have their upbringing explained, like when we see <em>Good Night, and Good Luck</em>—we don’t need to know the early life of Edward R. Murrow to explain how he became a journalist. Who cares?”</p><p>That’s a good question: Who cares? The central purpose those origin stories serve is to connect us with the heroes on a human level. Most of us don’t have more money than God or a Batcave nicer than most homes, but we all know losing our parents could emotionally damage us forever. Yet with the success of grounded superhero movies like Matt Reeves’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434"><em>The Batman</em></a></span>, we’re now seeing more films take a similar approach, relying heavily on exploring their heroes as people as they seek to deconstruct these legendary characters. We don’t need to see his parents’ murder early in the film to grasp the nature of his internal torment later on. He’s a broken man throughout the film for numerous reasons and is only held together by a dutiful compulsion to prevent crime.</p><p>From defending his upcoming Superman movie’s political slant to deriding critics who think his choice for the Man of Steel is a “pussy,” Gunn didn’t hold back in his<em> Times</em> interview. And hopefully, he keeps disrupting the superhero industrial complex known as Hollywood for years to come. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/relooted/" data-ref-id="5000-681702">Relooted</a> has been a big surprise for me. Trailers for the game seemed to advertise the sidescroller as a parkour-driven platformer game, but after playing it, I realized that it's first and foremost a <em>heist </em>game. While nabbing your prize and skillfully maneuvering through obstacles to reach the goal as fast as possible is a core part of the gameplay loop, the far more important component is the actual planning and setup stage that occurs beforehand, where you take on the role of a crew's mastermind and plan out every step of the heist.</p><p dir="ltr">Set at the end of the 21st century, Relooted sees you play as Nomali, who puts her intelligence and acrobatic prowess to good use when she gets roped into heading up a crew of everyday citizens turned thieves. The crew plans on breaking into museums and mansions across the West to steal back the African artifacts locked away in vaults. Not for personal gain, of course, but to return them to where they rightfully belong.</p><p dir="ltr">Each mission begins with you mapping out the target, identifying which doors will lock when the alarms sound, which windows you can break through, where a zipline can be placed, and other aspects of the heist. During this planning stage, you can move certain objects too, like tables that can be placed to keep a door from fully closing, or put into a spot to act as a vault to reach otherwise unreachable ledges. Once you take the artifact, the alarms will sound and you'll have only a few seconds to make your getaway. Your job is to prepare enough so that the parkour challenge in front of you is quick and doable, and most missions don't have a singular solution.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPIK9z9lDI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmPIK9z9lDI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played, it makes for a fulfilling, puzzle-driven experience that rewards you for experimenting and trying to solve a heist in your own way. I really enjoyed the half-hour of the game I've played, falling in love with Relooted's setting, characters, and gameplay loop. It's currently one of my most anticipated games of 2025, largely for how good it felt to see my well-laid plans culminate in perfect escapes or adaptation in the moment resulting in nail-biting close calls.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of Relooted's release, I spoke with a few members of South African studio Nyamakop to discuss the game's futuristic African setting, development, and heist-driven gameplay. The game is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC--it doesn't yet have a firm release date.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: While the Afrofuturism setting has a decent foothold in pop culture, a futuristic Africa doesn't. Where does the team start from when crafting this world and these characters, and how do you avoid just using Afrofuturism themes and tropes? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Creative Director Ben Myres</strong>: So on the visual design side of the stuff, [narrative director Mohale Mashigo], me, and Bongane [Mahlangu], our art director and our concept artist, used to have some very intense battles and fights over how the character should look. Because there are some references, but there aren't a lot. You have to basically know concept artists on the continent that are imagining future Africa and just be able to find them on Pinterest and stuff. But there's this tension between how ritualistic you want the characters to look.</p><p dir="ltr">You also need to consider the functionality of the outfits. They are running and doing a heist at the end of the day. So it needs to be functional but maybe not too functional--it still needs to be cool. And then you also need to [consider] how far in the future [the game is]. How futurist can we make it as well? Is it completely alien? But if you do that, then some of the African and local place references become harder to spot for the people who know them and see them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mohale Mashigo</strong>: Some inspiration also came from contemporary African designers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527338-re2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527338" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527338-re2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527338"></a><figcaption>Relooted takes place in the future near the end of the 21st century.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527338-re2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>In terms of the makeup of the team, are y'all all in this same location?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Producer Sithe Ncube</strong>: A lot of people are based in Johannesburg. Some people are based in Cape Town, but we also have people [elsewhere], like a 3D artist in Ethiopia. But even among the people who are working on the game, there are people [of] different backgrounds. I'm originally from Zambia. When I started on this, I was living in Port Elizabeth and now I'm in Johannesburg. We also had people work on the game from Ghana [and] Nigeria. And the voice actors are also from [all over]. They have different backgrounds as well, all of which are pretty close to the backgrounds of the actual characters.</p><p dir="ltr">For me personally, even before I started working on this project, I've been very interested in what people are doing in other parts of Africa in terms of game development.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm always very curious to know about them [and] how [their heritage and background] actually lends itself to the game. Because there are some instances where it's like, maybe we need a pronunciation for this type of thing. And you can ask someone who's very close with someone in the team or even just someone within the team.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the environment art [is affected]. Someone told me that they really like the rooftops in our game and I was like, "What?" I've literally never heard anyone comment on rooftops, but they said, "Yeah, you can see that it's purposely African. It's good."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527339-re3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527339" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527339-re3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527339"></a><figcaption>Each artifact that you recover is real, and Relooted details the origins of each mark you go after.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527339-re3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I love that though! I love that there's just someone out there that's like, "You know Relooted? You know that game? Awesome African rooftops. Peak authenticity when it comes to rooftops." Speaking of the rooftops--you spend a lot of time running along them as you plan stuff out. Does the game ever put limits on that planning stage, like the amount of time you can take?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: I think we thought about doing it at some point. I think we might've even had versions where we tried it out, but what we're looking at is trying to essentially adapt the heist filmic structure to a game. And to do that you almost have to focus on just one part of the structure because of just the way games work. And the part we really wanted to focus on recreating was being in a heist montage from a heist film and usually in films you as the viewer don't know the plan until the end and you watch them go through the plan, but in games you can't necessarily do that. You can't have all this hidden information from the player.</p><p dir="ltr">So we had to focus on allowing the player to figure out the plan so that when they're executing it, they understand what they've been doing. So as a result, we realized that putting that time pressure there might weaken that aspect of it because you won't understand the plan as well. And there are often some pretty hard levels where if you've missed a certain step in at least the core path, there aren't a lot of ways out. So we tested that idea [of a time limit], but it just ended up ruining the sort of rewarding feeling that you get when you're executing and flowing through a plan that you've made up yourself. You feel like a genius, like, "Damn, this is my plan."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527340-re1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527340" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527340-re1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4527340"></a><figcaption>Before you jump into the thick of things, you need to plan the heist.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4527340-re1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When it comes to heist games, I think there's this almost innate draw to add new tricks and tools so missions can grow increasingly complex. When it comes to Relooted, when do you stop gaining new tools? And does the game hit a sort of stable level of complexity when that happens?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mashigo</strong>: So each team member is essentially the tool that you need and you have to [recruit them]. In the story, you'll see that, "Okay, I probably can't use the locksmith Trevor only by himself," and then narratively, it'll be like, "Well, you need to go find somebody else," and you acquire [each member] slowly, but eventually you learn how to use the team better. As the levels get bigger, [you begin to realize that] they can't be everywhere. They're only human. They're not magical. And then you have to decide, "I have to put him here because I think I can go through there and maybe she'll be there." And so your tools are your team actually, so you feel like you're working with people.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: I'm trying to think when does that end exactly? When does Lusa join the team?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mashigo</strong>: It ends in the beginning of Chapter 6. That's when she joins.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: Yeah, so it's like the beginning of Chapter 6 of the eight chapters [when] you get the last crew member and then there are some absurd or at least one very absurd level that you have to play [after that]. It's quite complicated. So it does get more complicated, but I think it almost asks you to be more tactical and there's one level towards that [point], somewhere in those chapters that is very elaborate and complex.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mashigo</strong>: It's a monster.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Myres</strong>: The demo you played is very compressed because we wanted people to be able to see the best part of the game in a shorter period of time, but it takes quite a while to build up to that in the actual game because there's so many small, tiny mechanics that you have to understand in order to execute a heist fully. But the game is actually quite a slow burn of increasing complexity--at least until chapter six. And then at some point between Chapter 6 and Chapter 8, we just throw [in a monster level].</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> recently received new cosmetic bundles as part of the launch of Season 9, and while they are much cheaper than the usual skins and cosmetics offered in the in-game shop for Blizzard's ARPG, players don't seem too impressed with the value.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class has received a new cosmetic bundle labeled in the in-game shop as an "Essentials Pack." These cosmetic packs contain six skins for that specific class for only 500 Platinum, which roughly equates to $5. That makes these class bundles some of the most affordable microtransactions offered in Diablo 4 to date, as most of the game's cosmetic bundles (like its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">limited-time Berserk cosmetics</a>) often cost $25 or more.</p><p dir="ltr">Players on places like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1lpamvl/new_store_deal_6_skins_for_500_plat/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/new-diablo-4-store-deal-offers-6-skins-for-just-500-platinum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, however, aren't too impressed at the value of six skins for $5, as the outfits look mundane when compared to Diablo 4's pricier cosmetics. Some on the Diablo 4 subreddit point out that the skins look to be modified or reskinned versions of armor that already exists in-game for free, though some sets come with a unique helmet or other changes. One player in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1lpamvl/comment/n0v3i9h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comments</a> points out that they already own some pieces of these bundles despite having never bought any cosmetics, instead having acquired them through playing the game and dismantling items to acquire the transmog. For those who have already acquired some of the cosmetics in the bundles just by playing the game, the bundle price decreases slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">With the skins looking so similar to that of transmog options already present in Diablo 4, some players are wondering why they weren't simply included for free, while others think $5 is a fair asking price. Others, however, think $5 is far too steep for slightly altered items they may already own.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time players have criticized Diablo 4's microtransactions. More recently, players have taken issue with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">Diablo 4's revamped Reliquary battle pass system</a>, which grants fewer rewards and less premium currency than before. Since the Reliquary system's debut as part of Season 8, players have discovered the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-reliquary-battle-pass-system-is-even-worse-than-players-originally-thought/1100-6532514/" data-ref-id="1100-6532514">battle pass is even worse than originally thought</a>, as previous issues have compounded with poor UX design, pricey bundles, and confusing wording.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it has heard the negative feedback regarding the Reliquary system and will be looking to make changes in the future, but those changes didn't come in time for Season 9. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kt05z4/comment/mtsld3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comment</a> on Reddit earlier this year, Diablo director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher said the goal of the Reliquary system is to add cosmetics for all players, not just those who pay more money, and that Blizzard will look to bring "better options and value" when it comes to cosmetics tied to crossover events.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9, which brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to Nightmare dungeons</a> and lets players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own Horadric spells</a>, launched July 1 and is slated to end on September 23. Old-school Diablo fans may also have something to look forward to, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Blizzard seems to be teasing new Diablo 2 content</a> might be on the way.</p>

But hear this: You’re not driving all the way to Arrakeen easily. It’s quite the distance. Thankfully, for the low, low price of a few thousand Solaris, you can enjoy the beautiful sight of a loading screen while fast traveling to distant cities in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>. But is it worth the expense?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h11527"><a id=""></a>Where to find fast travel options</h2><p>You’ll initially encounter an Ornithopter Pilot in the back right corner of Griffin’s Reach Tradepost, sitting atop a rocky outcropping to the east of the game’s starting location. It’s tough to miss, as the entire building is a stone sentinel soaring into the sky. You’ll likely find tons of new player bases in the immediate area, too.</p><p>For now, let’s focus on the young pilot. She’s willing to bring you to:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Hagga Basin</strong></li><li><strong>Arrakeen (House Atreides settlement)</strong></li><li><strong>Harko Village (Harkonnen stronghold)</strong></li></ul><p>But it’s not free. <strong>The fast travel option in <em>Dune: Awakening</em> sets you back 2,500 Solaris</strong>, which isn’t a small sum. You’ll most likely pay the fee to reach Arrakeen or Harko Village, where you’ll find an Imperial Tax Collector, who will charge you money for the upkeep of your base. If you don’t pay, they’ll send enforcers your way. <strong>So, pay.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="1efa8636b1ddb0b47f55d1172bc81f40" data-recommend-id="image://1efa8636b1ddb0b47f55d1172bc81f40" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The price of fast travel in Dune Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The price of fast travel in Dune Awakening." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1efa8636b1ddb0b47f55d1172bc81f40" data-recommend-id="image://1efa8636b1ddb0b47f55d1172bc81f40" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The price of fast travel in Dune Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, the fast travel option is rather bland.

But it’s a weak little toy compared to what you’ll get by progressing deeper into the game. Instead of paying the Ornithopter Pilot to carry you to and fro for a costly sum, you will inevitably build your own flying vehicle. There are three:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Scout Ornithopter</li><li>Assault Ornithopter</li><li>Carrier Ornithopter</li></ul><p>Unless you’re assaulting an enemy base or traveling with a guild or group on a farming run, you likely won’t require the Assault or Carrier options; a Scout, while weaker, will suffice for travel. It’s also the cheapest to craft, thankfully.</p><p>But what about riding the worm like Paul Atreides in the books and films? Unfortunately, sandworm riding is not a mechanic in the game; there are rumors, speculation, and wishes from the community that it’ll come in an update down the road, but no official confirmation just yet.</p><hr><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-fast-travel-solaris-ornithopter-pilot-1851785740]]></content:encoded>

Most of us here at <em>Kotaku </em>own the thing and have been playing it over the past four weeks. Now that we’ve had extensive time with the Switch 2, what do we think about it? How has Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most revolutionary video game consoles of all time turned out? We gathered everyone on staff with a Switch 2 and asked them to weigh in on a few topics.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-recommend-id="image://0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-recommend-id="image://0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like most folks, the Switch 2 game I’ve put the most time into is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, though not as much time as you might think. A lot of my time with the Switch 2’s launch line-up has also involved booting up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, being like, “Oh wow, this works pretty well,” then closing it out. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a handheld is the kind of sicko shit that should have me glued to my Switch 2, but once the novelty wears off, I remember I’ve played it fairly recently and it can’t maintain my attention for that long. Funnily enough, the game I’ve spent the most time playing on my Switch 2 is a Vita game from 2015. Shout-out to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>. It’s a bit telling that Switch 2 games aren’t really what I’m playing on my system. While it’s certainly not set up to fail in the same way, the launch line-up of mostly older games that put the system’s jump in power front and center is giving Wii U. These games are great, they run well, and it’s nice to have them on something I can play on a plane. But I’m waiting for <em>Donkey Kong </em>and the Switch 2 version of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is really, really good! It’s a blast to play with friends or by yourself. It looks sharp, performs perfectly, and even includes a nifty open world that’s fun to explore. And uh, well, ummm, I guess there were some other games, too. But nearly every game available on Switch 2 at launch was something I’ve played or could play on another, more powerful platform. Yes,<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> looks nice on a Switch 2, but I’ve got it on PC. And Xbox Series X. I think when the dust settles and we look back on the Switch 2’s launch, it will be clear that it’s one of the weakest debut line-ups in Nintendo history. -<strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p><p>The launch lineup always felt weak, but a month with the new hardware has made that fact inescapable. My<em> Mario Kart World </em>excitement (and that of my kids) petered out after the first couple of weeks. I think <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> both run decently—much better than PS4/Xbox One games did on the Switch 1. <em>Street Fighter 6</em> plays well on the Switch 2 as well. It’s far from ideal-looking, but I hope many more people now experience last year’s excellent <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> thanks to the Switch 2 port. But between Game Pass (<em>Rematch</em>/<em>The Alters</em>) and <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign </em>and<em> Death Stranding 2</em> on PS5, I’ve barely touched the new console this last week. Does<em> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>look better than ever? It sure does, but I already played over 100 hours of it on Switch 1. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>Though I bought <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>for my Switch 2 and am still looking forward to playing through its RPG-lite story mode, World Tour, at some point, the two games in heaviest rotation on my Switch 2 have definitely been <em>Mario Kart World </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. <em>MKW </em>is a delight. Every time I fire it up and see Mario or Wario or Wiggler or some other character tooling around in that bright, inviting landscape, I just feel good, ready to hit the open road. Still, now that I’ve gotten gold in most of the game’s single-player cups and knockout tours, I’m not playing it as regularly as I did initially. I do still enjoy jumping in sometimes to try to defeat another Nintendo-provided ghost racer in a time trial or to tackle a few more P-Switch challenges, though. And I’m always down to hop into online action with friends, where the game really shines.</p><p>But, oddly, it’s not a Nintendo game that’s keeping me most occupied with my new Nintendo console—which definitely makes this a departure from a typical Nintendo launch for me. Instead, it’s <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I have my issues with this game but it plays great on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid, and I love smoothly shifting from a Night City session on my TV to a bit of gameplay in bed. As much as I’m in awe of the port, though, which indicates to me that the Switch is capable of some very impressive things, it is odd and arguably not great that the strongest thing available out of the gate on the Switch 2, for me at least, is a game that’s several years old and available on numerous other platforms. Of course, it’s early days yet, and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is just a few weeks away. But I hope Nintendo has a few other surprises up its sleeve to give these first few post-launch months a little more oomph. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>There were launch games? I don’t think I can count five-year-old ports in that category, so we’re pretty much left with <em>Mario Kart</em>, and…ehh. It’s quite something when adding an entire open world still leaves the game feeling far too much like other recent entries, and as such, it has made the Switch 2 itself feel so utterly unessential on launch. That’s the word I keep coming back to, when friends ask if it’s worth buying one for themselves or their kids. Honestly, right now, it’s just inessential. I really hope that will change once <em>DK</em> is out. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-recommend-id="image://fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-format="jpg" data-width="2397" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-recommend-id="image://fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-format="jpg" data-width="2397" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2 feels hefty, but also, maybe <em>too</em> hefty. The original Switch felt mostly fine, but its Joy-Cons were about as sturdy as a children’s toy. Switch 2’s controllers feel expensive and premium, and the bigger screen does feel like a pretty sizable upgrade from the Switch. The downside is that the Switch 2 is heavy enough to give me wrist pain when I’m holding it for too long. As such, I try to play mine in tabletop mode as much as possible when I’m in bed, and the Joy-Cons are the perfect controllers for a side sleeper who sets the Switch 2 up on its kickstand next to his pillow. The Switch 2 feels like a high-end device, but it comes with drawbacks to my wrists. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>The Switch 2 looks great and feels even better, at least relative to the Switch 1. I don’t like that the back panel still flexes and feels hollow, and the Joy-Con are still a bit too wobbly for my taste. I wish there were some great third-party portable-mode alternatives for the Joy-Con right now, but because of the magnetic locks it seems like Hori and others will need a minute to develop the Switch 2 versions of their Switch 1 controllers. Also the screen blur feels like I’m drunk. Just kidding, I actually can’t tell at all. Despite the technical tests revealing staggeringly slow refresh speeds for the Switch 2, I’ve had zero complaints so far. I love that the screen is edged this time too, instead of the rounded surfaces of the original. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>I’m no <em>Digital Foundry</em> so my understanding of what’s actually inside the new box is limited, but it sure <em>feels</em> better. It’s a joy to play <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> and not have to wait for the doors to open after shooting them. As for the Switch itself, it feels very solid, the kickstand feels sturdy, and there’s nothing cheap or tacky about it. But, like its only launch game, it certainly suffers from looking and feeling far too much like what we already had. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>I’m not the type to scrutinize my device’s screen for faults or to measure frame rate on one platform against another, so I’m not really the person to ask serious questions about hardware quality. I can say that I have no complaints; the device has a sturdy heft to it, the screen is—to my eyes—bright and captivating, and the Switch 2 Pro Controller feels like a natural extension of my hands. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>The OG Switch felt like a cheap toy in my big, dumb hands. In less than a week, the kickstand on my Switch broke, and it flapped open when I tried to hold it as a handheld. One of my Joy-Cons succumbed to stick drift and had to be taken out back. It never completely failed on me, and it was always charged and ready for me to play it. But using the Switch was a disappointing experience for me.</p><p>Switch 2, on the other hand, is wonderful. It feels like a high-end tech device, which is nice considering its daunting price tag. The kickstand is strong. The Joy-Con feel better. Everything feels better. The screen is also bigger. The whole unit just sits more comfortably in my massive, chunky hands. And that’s all I wanted. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-recommend-id="image://5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-recommend-id="image://5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2’s user interface and home screen are essentially carbon copies of the OG Switch. Some are disappointed by this, but I like it. For so long, consoles have tried to reinvent the wheel with each new release. And so each new console generation brings fresh menus that have to be updated and improved, as they often lack key features and options found in the old UI. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo took a page from Xbox and just copied the old UI, improved it in some small ways, and called it a day. Would I like some new themes? Sure. For now, though, the UI and menus work perfectly, and I didn’t need to relearn everything. That was nice. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I guess you don’t have to fix what isn’t broken, but it was kind of funny to boot up the Switch 2 and see its menus look exactly like those of the first system. This is pretty standard fare for tech these days. You boot up an old iPhone, and its screen looks pretty similar to a brand-new one. However, this doesn’t happen as much with game systems. The UI of most video game consoles looks noticeably different from that of its ancestors. Though the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S kept visual elements from their predecessors, they weren’t carbon copies of the last generation. The Switch 2’s menus are faster and snappier, but if you put a gun to my head and showed me both screens side-by-side, I’m not sure I’d be able to differentiate between the two. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>It’s fine? Hardly anything is different. The responsive eShop is nice but I’m betting performance on that does not hold up even by the end of the first year. And there’s still so much negative space in the home menu and no way to customize it. Sigh — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>I genuinely found the Switch 2’s UI to be profoundly disappointing. Psychically upsetting, even. There’s always that horrible moment after you’ve bought a new phone, spent all that money to buy a slightly improved rectangle, then transferred across all your stuff to realize it now just looks like the phone you already had. That was exactly my experience with the Switch 2. I did the data transfers as instructed on first booting, and then had this gut-punch moment when I looked down and saw…my old Switch. Same games, in the same order, in the same layout, with the same poorly labeled on-screen buttons. For god’s sake, they could at least have given it a punch-up, just <em>something</em> new. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>Nintendo knows how to be subtly charming, using cute little blips and blops to lend a sense of laid-back fun to UIs that prioritize simplicity, elegance, and ease of use. The Switch 2’s are basically a redux of the original Switch’s in this regard, and why not? That all worked fine. (Well, the eShop certainly didn’t, and it’s great to see it running so much more smoothly and quickly here, but the basic design worked fine, and that’s largely unchanged.) I do hope Nintendo gives us more options for themes at some point, as I’d love to finally have a home screen on my Switch that boasts more personality. But I’m not disappointed with what’s here, even if it does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity to drive home the feeling that you’re using a new, more powerful device than the one you’ve been using for the past eight years. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-recommend-id="image://aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-format="jpg" data-width="1596" data-height="896" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-recommend-id="image://aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-format="jpg" data-width="1596" data-height="896" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2’s online features fall into the same trap as my PlayStation 5’s do, in that it’s so much simpler to connect with people on external apps, I don’t use the ones built into the system. The C button opens up GameChat, but it’s not as convenient as hopping on a Discord call and using better mics and cameras. It’s funny watching your friend’s camera shake when you hit them with a Blue Shell in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I can’t see myself using any of these internal systems when I’ve grown so accustomed to better, easier services to keep in contact with friends, regardless of if they’re playing a Switch 2 game with me. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>Once, while I was playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>with Zack and his wife Sarah, I hit him with a red shell as he sped past me. Not only did this make his kart spin out; it also made the live feed of his face, which was hovering above his kart thanks to the webcam he hooked up, spin around as well. What more could you want in a new console’s online features? GameChat owns, and I look forward to using it a lot more in the months and years to come. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>Here’s something I never expected: To be impressed with a Nintendo console’s online features. The real star of the show is GameChat, which at first glance looked like a crappy Discord knock-off. And to be fair, it kind of is, but it also works brilliantly. I was able to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my wife and I, sharing a TV, and two other people online. And it just worked.</p><p>We could chat to them and they could talk to us with no headset needed. I could even see their gameplay via the share screen feature. Their faces even appeared in the game thanks to the Switch 2’s webcam support. As someone who doesn’t use Discord much, having all this built into the console is nice and makes playing games online with our buddies so much more communal and friendly. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I honestly don’t know. I’ve only ever hit the C button by mistake, as the last thing I want is other people interfering when I’m trying to play video games. I guess I’m glad the device can run its own god-awful store software this time, though? — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>I tested out the GameChat and video share features and found them to be somewhere between barebones and a fun novelty. Quality aside, simply using the system still isn’t as easy or intuitive as what’s on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and nothing beats Discord for cross-platform hangs (at least for now). Until Nintendo does something really creative with it, it feels like a function I’ll barely use because that’s not what I play on my Switch 2 for. —<strong> Ethan Gach</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-recommend-id="image://027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1498" data-height="838" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-recommend-id="image://027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1498" data-height="838" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I like my Switch 2, but it has mostly slipped comfortably into the same space in my life as the original Switch did. Sure, it’s a better One of Those, but that’s all it feels like right now. Without a big gimmick or game-changing shift, it’s the same thing with a bigger screen and heavier Joy-Con. I’m glad I got it, though. I was willing to pay half a grand for a device that would likely play <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> with fewer framerate dips and that would give me a new way to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I’m playing the thing pretty consistently, but I forget that it’s a shiny new thing most of the time. It is the most “phone upgrade” console leap I’ve felt in years. It’s a better-running Switch, for good and for ill. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>Incredibly mid! I think I’m more down on the Switch 2 than most, but it’s been a pretty underwhelming first month for me. After the initial dopamine hit of a new Nintendo handheld wore off I was left with a device that is markedly better but doesn’t have anything for me to really dig into yet. Hopefully, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> turns that around. There’s certainly plenty of other Nintendo games coming out this year. But right now it feels more like I just went from the DS Lite to the DSi XL. The Switch 2 is nice to have but hard to justify. I look forward to singing its unqualified praises in a year, or when the OLED model inevitably arrives in 2028. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>One month in, I’d describe myself as tentatively very happy with my Nintendo Switch 2. It feels like a device that’s bursting with the potential to deliver terrific online experiences and absorbing single-player ones. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, with its support for up to 24 racers at once, and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, with its wonderfully destructible environments, suggest that Nintendo is trying to demonstrate, right out of the gate, what sets the Switch 2 apart from its predecessor. But its future beyond <em>Bananza</em>’s release also feels pretty ill-defined at the moment, and whether or not it will continue to get the support it needs in order to make this first year a strong one remains an open question. Hopefully we’ll get a Direct this month to fill us in on what we can look forward to in the near future, and I can go from being tentatively pleased with my purchase to simply pleased. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>I’ve already forgotten I own a Switch 2. It has become the new Switch and quickly has evolved into “my Nintendo console behind the TV.” In some ways, that might sound bad. I spent a lot of money on a device that has already disappeared into the background. Yet I see it as a positive. It shows that Nintendo succeeded at making a new console that was basically like your old one, but bigger, faster, and better in most ways. You don’t have to teach your kids how it works, buy new accessories for it, or rearrange your living room to make it work. It’s just a Switch, but nicer.</p><p>That does mean the Switch 2 isn’t a revolutionary device that will change how you play games. Instead, it will slot right into your daily gaming schedule, and the only time you’ll remember you upgraded is when you boot up something like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and go “Oh right, the old Switch couldn’t do this.” Mission accomplished, Nintendo. –<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I’m happier than the tone of my entries here would suggest. These headings just happen to highlight my areas of frustration. As a gaming device, I’m really pleased with it, albeit through a grey lens of annoyance given that my happiness is mostly because of improvements to things the original Switch was crap at. I wish Nintendo had been more imaginative here, even though sales have demonstrated that the company certainly <em>financially</em> made the right choices. I wish it were weirder, and I desperately wish Nintendo were not so hubristic as to have launched it with almost nothing new to play. But they’ve already sold over 5 million of them, so I doubt they’re looking for my advice on matters. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748]]></content:encoded>
