            <guid>1416010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="107" data-end="536">“Brains like a full-sized PC, body of a Mac Mini, and easier on your checkbook than either” would make a really strong dating site bio for a mini PC, and the Acemagic K1 is well worth swiping right for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">It’s an Amazon’s Choice mini PC preloaded with Windows 11 Pro that’s on sale for a limited time for just $220, a big 37% break from its usual $349.</a></p>
<p data-start="538" data-end="997">This deal isn’t about some janky plug-and-pray rig that you’ll be trying to return or replace within weeks or months — the Acemagic K1 is a bona fide, space-saving desktop replacement that fits in the palm of your hand. It has an AMD Ryzen 4300 processor that can max out at 3.7GHz and enough onboard memory (16GB) and storage (256GB) to juggle web tabs, creative apps, Discord, and whatever random emulator you’ve got open without the dreaded slowdown that turns productivity into an endless loading screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="538" data-end="997">Mini Build, Mini Price</h2>
<p data-start="999" data-end="1440">If you’re eyeing a Mac Mini purely because you want a tiny powerhouse combined with the flex that comes with all things Mac, this Acemagic K1 deal at Amazon is your wallet pleading with you to be reasonable. Yes, Apple’s M4-powered Mini is sleek and whisper-quiet, but it’ll set you back significantly more with similar memory — over twice as much, actually. We’ve seen gaming headsets that cost more than the Acemagic K1.</p>
<p data-start="1442" data-end="1860">But this discounted mini PC squeezes an AMD Ryzen-class processor and that generous RAM into a chassis the size of a thick paperback. You can hide it behind a monitor with a VESA mount, plop it next to your console, or shove it into your streaming cabinet without asking your partner for extra desk real estate. Add a monitor — or as many as three monitors — and keyboard you already own — <em>voila</em>, instant command center.</p>


<h2 data-start="1442" data-end="1860">Palm-Sized Powerhouse</h2>
<p data-start="1862" data-end="2277">To answer the inevitable question of <em data-start="1886" data-end="1911">“why not a laptop?”</em> — this isn’t about portability. The Acemagic K1 is a dedicated little beast with outstanding expansion potential and a whispery high-efficiency cooling system that quietly hum along while your laptop’s fan blasts like it’s trying to take off. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to offload background tasks, run servers, handle video encoding, or just give their main rig a break without dropping a pile of cash.</p>
<p data-start="2279" data-end="2649"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">Like all Amazon deals, this $220 price won’t linger forever.</a> Yesterday it was here, tomorrow it might be back at the full price of $349. If you’ve been mentally earmarking that desk corner for a proper PC that doesn’t look like a suitcase and sound like a jet turbine, your patience has just paid off. Whether it ends up as your primary machine, a home server, or the hub of all your nerdy projects, the Acemagic K1 one of the more legitimately great mini PC deals we’ve seen in a while.</p>

The indie developer said it was working with Valve to “resolve” the issue, and pointed to Void War's continued availability on Itch.io.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000. The voidships themselves look — in Void War’s official art — like Imperial Navy Vessels.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/ariokine-fleet-1769429015313.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Void War's aesthetic has been compared to Warhammer 40,000.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some of the characters look like Space Marines. There’s an actual Psyker that’s called a Psyker. There are “Imperial Shrineworlds.” There’s mention of “Imperial astrogation authorities.” You get the idea.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/cover-art-1769429044382.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This is not a Space Marine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the takedown, IGN asked Tundra Interactive for comment, and it responded with something quite unusual. It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what makes this one odd: the only claiming information Valve provided the developer it said, is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. It seems unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds, and that it would come after Void War now, half a year after release on Steam. And it’s worth pointing out Void War is still up on Itch.io, where no DMCA takedown appears to have taken place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive's comment to IGN in full:</p><blockquote>We received a DMCA takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop is claiming copyright infringement. We have not received any other communication from Games Workshop, and the only claimant information Valve has provided is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds,” which is unusual since that’s the main character from Firefly. We can’t independently verify who actually submitted the notice, and Games Workshop hasn’t responded yet to our email asking them to confirm or withdraw it. We’re following the standard DMCA process and will share further updates when we have confirmed information.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this may actually be a genuine DMCA takedown by Games Workshop, and there may well be a Mal Reynolds who's doing the dirty work. Perhaps there's an official FTL-style Warhammer 40,000 game in the works, and it's close to a reveal. Neither Games Workshop nor Valve has clarified the matter, and based on both companies' history when it comes to DMCAs, are unlikely to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which leaves Void War off Steam and Tundra Interactive, like the Imperium Nihilus itself, in the dark. As for Games Workshop, it’s got plenty of official Warhammer 40,000 games in development, including Dawn of War 4, Dark Heresy, and Total War: Warhammer 40,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Lots, <em>lots</em> more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And no, Re-Logic doesn't even say that this is the last update anywhere — despite insisting Terraria had received its last update for years — but of course, with the team promising that crossplay will be "made available some time after 1.4.5," there's at least one more patch on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When Rockstar learned about the release of Terraria 1.4.5, they postponed GTA 6 in fear," teased one player in the YouTube comments.

			<p>Despite having been released almost <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">eight years ago</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em> continues to be among the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">most popular open-world games</strong> released in the past few years. As the game can still be enjoyed at <strong>60 frames per second</strong> only on PC, however, fans have been asking Rockstar Games for<strong> a current-generation patch</strong> to boost the game on consoles, but <strong>their pleas have fallen on deaf ears so far.</strong></p>



<p>Reportedly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is getting a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S update</strong></a> in the future, alongside a<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, whose development is sure to be challenging enough even just taking the game's massive size of current versions of the game into account, but nothing has been announced so far. </p>



<p>However, we may have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wait longer</strong> to see Arthur Morgan ride from New Hanover to New Austin in glorious <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS on consoles</strong>, and it could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s fault</strong>, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly commented on this <strong>highly anticipated update</strong>.<em> "I can tell you 100% I know 8 devs that worked on RDR2 next gen,"</em> Kiwi Talkz said on <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2015523023701659724"><strong>X</strong></a>. <em>"It is a thing but Rockstar do whatever they want to do regarding release dates, maybe GTA 6 dev timelines changed the release schedule for everything, who knows, all I know is that I know devs have worked on it and it will come at some point."</em></p>



<p>Asked about a user regarding how long this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2 update has been in the works</strong>, Kiwi Talks couldn't talk about specifics, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Rockstar is heavily compartmentalised,"</em> and thus <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">sharing precise information</strong> could make it easy for Rockstar Games to know where it is coming from, which is a very sensible thing to do with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><strong>company that has shown not to have much tolerance for leakers</strong></a>. However, Kiwi Talkz commented on the matter to let fans know <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"the dream is not dead."</em></p>



<p>Although the reason for this long delay is unknown, Kiwi Talkz speculates it may have been due to the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> development timeline and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2-mobile-ios-netflix/">recent release of the Red Dead Redemption port</a></strong>. "<em>If I had to guess based on the limited info I know, I think they originally planned to release it earlier but because timelines changed with GTA 6 it massively delayed it,</em>" Kiwi Talks said. <em>"I personally don't think you'll see it now till late 2027 primarily because releasing RDR2 now would cut the wind out of RDR1s sales (which hasnt been out too long) and GTA 6 coming out late this year, they want GTA 6 dominating everything at least for a year before even entertaining the idea of RDR2 next gen."</em></p>



<p>If Rockstar Games is indeed waiting to complete development of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> and letting it dominate gaming, as<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> it is poised to do</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/"><strong>the game is not delayed again</strong></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will only see the light of day from <strong>2027 onward.</strong> </p>



<p><em>"Really excited to play it in the nursing home,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p5nym/"><strong>probablyuntrue on Reddit</strong></a>, echoing the <strong>wider community sentiment</strong>. <em>"Next consoles will be out by the time they release it,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p1pgx/"><strong>Blayzeman</strong></a>, voicing another concern among the community: will we be talking about a <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> PlayStation 6, next-generation Xbox port</strong> by the time GTA 6 is out and its full dominance established?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-drops-to-its-black-friday-low-after-multiple-price-cuts-now-priced-like-a-budget-android-smartphone-2000662878</link>
            <guid>1415986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google’s Pixel range offers some of the best Android phones on the market. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re after basic features for everyday use or want to enjoy all the latest advancements in the AI world.</p>
<p>The tech giant unveiled its Pixel 10 Series last year, featuring stunning models with a solid build, an impressive camera, a bright display, new AI tools, and a lot more. That said, its previous generation Pixel 9 phones are still an excellent option to consider, and pack many of the features found on the latest models. If you’ve been thinking of treating yourself to one, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">Amazon is offering the 128GB, unlocked Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Hazel at a 36% discount today, which drops its $1,099 price to just $699</a>. Basically, it’s cheaper than the basic Pixel 9 right now. Those willing to trade their older phone can save up to $600 on their purchase, too, but you might not be able to combine both offers. Trade-in credit is offered in the form of Amazon gift cards that you can use towards other purchases. We highly suggest grabbing the offer as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting it to stick around for longer than a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With AI Features</h2>
<p>Pixel 9 Pro XL features a stunning 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL Super Actua display, which is both bright and vivid. It offers excellent picture quality in all lighting conditions, whether you’re using it while soaking up some sun or in a dimmer setting at night. At the back, you’ll find a triple rear camera system that not just lets you take professional-level photos, but also high-quality video up to 20x with Super Res Zoom Video. You will also be able to film clearly in low light with Night Sight Video, as well as enhance your videos up to 8K with Video Boost.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the overall experience even further. For instance, there’s Gemini to make everyday tasks easier. It’s an efficient AI assistant that’s ready to help you with research, summarizing documents, creating content, getting reply suggestions, translations, and more – 24/7. Your purchase also includes a year of Google One AI Premium access, which includes Gemini Advanced and more tools, so you can unlock the full potential of your device. It typically costs $239, but here, it’s included for free.</p>



<p>Other cool smart features include “Add Me”, which makes it easy to add the photographer to group photos so no one is left out. It works by taking two shots (one of the group, and the other when the photographer has swapped places with someone) and merging them together into a single photo. Then there’s “Click to Search”, which lets you circle an image or text to perform a quick Google search.</p>
<p>The 128GB space in this version is roomy enough to house all your photos, videos, applications, and documents comfortably. Battery is another strong selling point, as a single charge offers over 24 hours of usage. What’s more, the Extreme Battery Saver extends that to up to 100 hours, making it perfect for off-road trips and power outages.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">You can now upgrade for just $699, after a massive $400 discount. It’s a rare drop, so it’s best to snap it quickly before it expires.</a></p>

<p>Embark Studios has revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and it looks like content will be dropping thick and fast. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The roadmap</a> details plans up until April 2026, but the first batch of updates falls under a mysterious title—Headwinds.</p>



<p>Substantial updates are what keep live-service titles like ARC Raiders alive and fresh, and the rust-belt has been pretty barren since Cold Snap ended. Well, new content is just around the corner, as Headwinds is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>







<p>Here’s when you can expect Headwinds to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-headwinds-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does ‘Headwinds’ Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s looming on the horizon. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Headwinds update has been confirmed by Embark Studios to arrive in ARC Raiders on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When the roadmap was initially revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-arc-raiders-february-2026-content-map-update-raider-deck-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, it was fairly surprising to see a slate of content listed to arrive in January, as the month was practically over. However, Embark Studios clearly didn’t plan to partake in dry January, as new content is just around the corner. </p>



<p>Headwinds is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but if you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PST)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—January 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-headwinds-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All ‘Headwinds’ Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roll on April. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced within the roadmap, three new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Matchmaking Option Level 40+</li>



<li>New Minor Map Condition</li>



<li>New Player Project</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, further details are scarce. The Player Project is bound to be another five-stage project filled with items you’ll need to submit in return for rewards, but the new Minor Map Condition and Matchmaking Option remain a mystery.</p>







<p>Early player theories are that the new Map Condition will be a sandstorm, as alluded to by the background image in the roadmap, as well as the Headwinds title. If this were the case, then the likelihood is that it’ll be exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-guitars-shakers-in-arc-raiders-buried-city-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, and maybe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hidden-bunker-arc-raiders-how-to-open-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spaceport</a>, as a sandstorm sweeping through The Blue Gate might be a bit far-fetched. </p>



<p>As for the new Matchmaking Option, it’s interesting that they highlight it’s for Level 40+ players. It might be in an effort to circumvent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-will-implement-significant-changes-to-crack-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaters</a>—who primarily use new, low-level accounts—from ruining the match experience for high-level players with valuable gear.</p>



<p>Should more information be announced before the Headwinds update, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with the latest details. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass? Code Vein 2 Game Pass Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1415977</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass keeps receiving new games. With increased Game Pass costs, it begs the question of whether Code Vein 2 is coming to Xbox Game Pass to justify the cost, and if not, if it will ever happen.</p>



<p>Soulslike fans should be in for a good time with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a>. There was plenty to enjoy from the genre in 2025 with Nightreign, The&nbsp;First&nbsp;Berserker:&nbsp;Khazan, and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Code Vein 2 is the first real Soulslike contender of 2026, and if it’s on Game Pass, it’s a win-win.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-code-vein-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An unsuccessful ride. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass isn’t adding Code Vein 2 as a launch-day game, meaning all players need to buy the game outright to own it and play.</strong></p>



<p>The pro of Xbox Game Pass is that you get a <em>lot</em> of free titles as part of your subscription. The bad news is that you only get a select variety of games. Also, even if you have the more expensive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier, your day-one release entitlement is limited, and it depends on any agreements between Microsoft and other publishers.</p>



<p>A quick check of the Xbox store shows that under Code Vein 2’s listing, there is nothing about Xbox Game Pass. There’s no Game Pass icon or mention, nor has it been referenced in any Code Vein 2 trailers. It hasn’t been outed by Bandai Namco, nor Microsoft or Xbox, so we can safely assume that it’s not on Xbox Game Pass, and it probably won’t be in the foreseeable future.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-code-vein-2-ever-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Code Vein 2 Ever Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>This one has to be filed under ‘Unlikely,’ as the first Code Vein hasn’t even debuted on Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Any sort of a sequel is great as it gives plenty of background data on previous entries in a series, and if they’ve ever been on Xbox Game Pass. The original Code Vein doesn’t appear to have been on Game Pass (but we’ll update this if it’s incorrect), making the case for Code Vein 2 on XGP quite bleak.</p>



<p>Like Code Vein 2 itself, it’s not impossible, and a Game Pass addition could be doable in the future. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Progress on the third chapter of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-are-making-great-progress-confirms-director">has been steady and smooth</a> so far, with the game having already reached a "playable" state <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/">according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi</a>. Now, we've received an update on its (still secret) title and what engine the team is using.</p>
<p>The news came via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot's latest interview</a> with the director, which was shared on 23rd January, right as Final Fantasy 7 Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2</a> with excellent ports. Without getting into actual spoilers, the "Remake" label of these games goes beyond the traditional use of the word, as there's a meta narrative which has gradually reshaped the direction of the overall trilogy.</p>
<p>As a result, fan expectations since Rebirth's release was that Part 3's title would be in line with the previous two. No word on what the final name is yet, but Hamaguchi has now said "the title has been locked" following creative director (and OG FF7 veteran) Tetsuya Nomura making the final decision recently.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit which explains the threequel's fast-moving development comes from Hamaguchi confirming they've ultimately decided to use Unreal Engine 4 over UE5 after making "a lot of modifications to fit our needs." As impressive as UE5 can be when used properly, it's also led to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/unreal-engine-5-has-been-a-disappointment">several high-profile disappointments</a>, so it's not surprising to see one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s key teams playing things safe in the last stretch of this hugely ambitious trilogy. "It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs," he added.</p><p>This should also help with getting Rebirth and the as-yet-untitled third chapter running on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> following Remake's remarkable looks and stable performance. At this moment, the team has "gotten [Rebirth] to function" on Nintendo's still-infant hybrid console, but a release date won't be locked until more optimizations are done.</p>
<p>It's all quite impressive considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> launched less than two years ago and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">almost no documentation</a>" remains from the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s development, but in the age of the average AAA project taking around half a decade to finish (if we're lucky), Hamaguchi's team seems to have cracked the code with this daring three-part effort.</p>

<figure data-uuid="14d63d770966d"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14d63d770966d/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>So, the third entry in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy officially has a final title (or subtitle, as is more likely), according to an interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi over at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>It's a pretty significant milestone, and as stated by Hamaguchi-san, the team had it down to two potential titles during Paris Games Week at the end of October 2025. He said that the final decision was ultimately up to creative director Tetsuya Nomura, who served as co-director on Remake alongside Hamaguchi and Motomu Toriyama.</p>
<p>Here's what Hamaguchi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was up to Mr. Nomura to decide which it is. And yes, after returning from Paris Games Week, he did choose one, so I can say the title has been locked."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine having such a crucial decision rest on your shoulders. The power!</p>
<p>Of course, this news has merely reignited our curiosity as to what the title will actually be. 'Reunion' certainly sounds plausible, but then that's already been used for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crisis_core_-final_fantasy_vii-_reunion">Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion</a> and the recently-announced <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/life_is_strange_reunion">Life is Strange: Reunion</a>.</p>
<p>We're also not too sure when Square Enix will decide to fully reveal the game given that it will also need to coordinate the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on the Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. Phew!</p>
<p>Still, that certainly won't stop us from speculating. So we've compiled a poll below with some possible (and not-so-possible) subtitles for the third entry, so go ahead and choose which one speaks to you the most. And if you have a completely different idea, then be sure to let us know with a comment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clive Barker’s Undying RTX Remix Path Tracing Mod Alpha Release Now Available]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/</link>
            <guid>1415950</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest<strong> RTX Remix path tracing mod</strong> to be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-mod/addons/undying-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on ModDB</a> is dedicated to <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong>. The original game, an acclaimed first-person survival horror released by <strong>EA Los Angeles</strong> nearly twenty-five years ago, was made <strong>with the very first iteration of Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>With the power of NVIDIA RTX Remix, modder <strong>Pathtracedparadise</strong> heavily overhauled the visuals. Some of their work includes <strong>replacing more than a thousand of the original game's textures</strong> so far with high-resolution (2048x2048) PBR materials that have been upscaled with additional levels of detail added by running each texture multiple times through various Topaz Gigapixel models and then hand-edited as needed. The PBRFusion model was used to generate the PBR map via ComfyUI.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>this is still just an Alpha release</strong> of Clive Barker's Undying RTX Remix path tracing mod. The modder has so far focused on revamping the first couple of hours, as well as a few sections later in the game. The remainder of the game is playable, as lights were automatically placed throughout by a custom D3D9 renderer, but they are not placed in ideal locations and have not yet been adjusted to look good. Furthermore, there are other issues at the moment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mirrors still need to be fixed</li>



<li>Portals do not animate</li>



<li>Skyboxes aren't rendering correctly</li>



<li>Only some of the Scrye reveals work </li>
</ul>



<p>If you still want to check out the mod (whose download is around <strong>10.5 GB</strong> at the moment) even at this early stage, you'll have to <strong><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/undying-renewal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first install the Undying Renewal mod</a></strong>, which adds proper widescreen support with more resolution options (up to 4K), quality of life improvements, controller support, multiplayer support, subtitles support, restores cut content, adds a Vulkan renderer for improved performance, reduces load times, and adds a functional in-game settings menu. </p>



<p>After that mod is installed, extract the files from the "Place contents in Undying System folder" folder to the System folder of your Clive Barker's Undying installation (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System), overriding any existing files. Then, <strong>you must run the game once to ensure the RTX Remix hooks are installed</strong> (you should see a message in the top-left corner of the screen and be able to access the RTX Remix menu by pressing Alt+X). Close the game, then open the System folder location (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System) and create an 'rtx-remix' folder within it. Extract the entire 'Undying RTX Mod' folder into this 'mods' folder. To adjust the Field of View (FOV) value, you'll have to edit it directly in the User.ini file.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s shift from early access to full release came with heap of tweaks and changes as Larian finalised their huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Naturally, this meant certain bits or plans not making it into the final cut, and if you've come to long for any of those after playing them initially or hearing about them, then odds are a new mod is right up your alley. It's also really cool if you, you know, just want more BG3.</p>

<p>The mod's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description">Early Access Scenes Restored</a>' by modding whiz HyperspaceTowel, who's been working on restoring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17511">bits</a> of early access Baldur's Gate 3 for a little while now. This latest creation's the culmation of all that effort, delivering a bunch of restored "deleted scenes, encounters, and NPCs" in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>According to the modder, that's "over 100 conversations and more than 1000 lines of voiced dialogue" so far, with plans to keep adding more going forwards. Making that up are the likes of chats with resurrected early access characters, camp chats, and companion reactions to the various stuff you get up to. HyperspaceTowel explains that most of these returning bits were a case of bringing back an early access scene as "pretty much a 1:1 transplant" with minor camera or dialogue tweaks, though there were some that had to be "built from the ground up based on the scraps I could find".</p>

<p>The modder cites shell-collecting kid Lotan, whose reconstructed chat's shown in the video above, as an example of the latter. Among the other revived NPCs or chats you can expect to run into include would-be music box seller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um9-w9ovbn8">Nerela</a>, some enthralled fishermen, Shadowheart issuing an ultimatum, and Gale channeling his best Nigella Lawson as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiSvKArS4ac&amp;t=3s">yacks about his deer stew</a>.</p><p>HyperspaceTowel's opted to stick to including bits of early access BG3 which fit into the final version of the game, which means the likes of early Wyll and Karlach - plus some romance scenes featuring Gale and the former - have been left to go into another mod or mods which'll keep non-can stuff separate. They've also opted to keep separate a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/20098">freshly restored quest</a> surrounding whether or not to chow down on a hermit crab. The reason in that case looks primarily to be the fact the files it's been restored from are very old, so some of the dialogue lacks voice files.</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing what these restored early access encounters add to your next BG3 playthrough, the good news is that the main restoration mod appears not to require any other framework mods to work. However, you will want to make sure you kick off a new run once you've installed it and avoid ditching it midway through a playthrough you plan to finish.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-is-back-at-a-record-low-in-another-clearance-move-on-amazon-not-the-official-store-2000662800</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are deals, and then there are deals that make you say “This is the way.” (It’s OK to mix metaphors in a galaxy far, far away.) Right now, LEGO’s Star Wars Millennium Falcon has been restocked at Amazon after a heavy-duty holiday selling burst and it’s arrived in 2026 in one of those rare price windows where it’s genuinely worth firing up the hyperdrive and snagging it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">The Amazon limited-time deal for the 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is going for $68, 20% off its usual price.</a> That might sound like pocket change compared to what some of us drop on boxed trilogy marathons or obscure action figures, but when a set that’s this beloved dips below its typical tag, it’s actually worth paying attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Grown-Up LEGO Fun</h2>
<p data-start="855" data-end="1359">Now before you go imagining the 7,500-plus-piece Ultimate Collector Series starship that’s the size of a studio apartment and costs about a much — let’s be super clear: This is the smaller 25th Anniversary edition 921-piece Millennium Falcon that’s been popping up in deals lately. That said, 921 pieces is still plenty of bricks to keep your fingers busy and your inner kid grinning ear to ear, and this version comes with a display stand so you aren’t sacrificing precious shelf real estate to chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1361" data-end="1855">This isn’t one of those microfighters you flick at your coffee table. It’s the kind of model that earns a place of prominent display as a collector’s item and conversation piece, and not in a heap of other half-wrecked LEGO sets after a pretend battle. Kids probably <em data-start="1649" data-end="1654">can</em> build it, but this adult-oriented set feels more like a collectible for anyone who’s ever whispered “She’s faster than she looks” at a spaceship dangling from a peg at a toy store.</p>


<h2 data-start="1361" data-end="1855">Use the Force</h2>
<p data-start="1857" data-end="2195">LEGO Star Wars sets — even ones that aren’t giant — don’t linger on sale for long. They’re the kind of things that disappear off retailer sites faster than the Falcon makes the Kessel Run. When the price drops to a fresh low and stock comes back, it’s usually fleeting.</p>
<p data-start="2197" data-end="2503">So if you’ve been on the fence about adding this to your collection, now’s the time to decide. Whether it’s for a gift, a weekend build sesh, or a new centerpiece atop your entertainment center, a 20% drop on a fan-favorite set isn’t something that happens every week. See it while you can, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">while it’s still on sale at Amazon for just $68 — because once it sells out again, there’s no guaranteeing when it’ll be back.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mention of Starfield 2.0 is leading fans to believe the update is real; however, there’s still no word on when it might be released. </p>



<p>We have heard about Starfield getting a new update and a DLC several times back in 2025, without a concrete release date. We have seen Bethesda mention it for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third time</a> some months ago, and we also saw a tease with the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post; however, no concrete details have been shared. </p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-is-handling-starfield-2-0-in-a-weird-way">Bethesda is Handling Starfield 2.0 in a ‘Weird’ Way</h2>



<p>The latest mention of Starfield 2.0 comes from the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defining Duke Podcast</a>, with co-host MrMattyPlays, who claims he saw it behind closed doors. When talking about Starfield 2.0’s upcoming update with guest Gene Part, Matty started by saying, “The way Bethesda is handling 2.0 (Starfield 2.0) is weird.” </p>



<p>Matty confirmed that he saw it “behind closed doors”, but he can’t say anything else other than the fact that he saw it. He also confirmed that he wasn’t provided a release window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-starfield-2-0">What to Expect from Starfield 2.0?</h2>



<p>Though no concrete details have been revealed about Starfield 2.0, some information has been shared in a previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. It seems the game’s spaceflight mechanics will step away from loading screens for “more free-form and continuous” traversal, and the Creation System has also been enhanced for better spaceflight and future-proofed for upcoming titles. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Starfield 2.0 update will bring the long-anticipated PS5 and Switch 2 ports, with the developers optimising the title for “low power” devices like handhelds. Some sources have also shared that it won’t be on par with Cyberpunk 2.0. However, readers should treat this info with caution as it hasn’t been officially confirmed. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-all-kennys-quests-explained/</link>
            <guid>1415938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s collab with South Park continues, with the stars of the show dishing out a bunch of tasks to tick off to earn rewards, but understanding Kenny’s quests is a tough task.</p>



<p>There are no direct instructions to complete Kenny’s quests in Fortnite, so you will be shooting in the dark unless you know exactly what is being asked of you.</p>



<p>To make the task much easier, Insider Gaming has all the details on exactly what you need to do to work your way through Kenny’s tasks in Fortnite before they expire.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-kenny-quests">All Fortnite Kenny Quests</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tick them off. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests in Fortnite shouldn’t take too much difficulty to complete, once you know what they are, as they can mostly be ticked off by general gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>The tricky aspect comes from the fact that you need a translator to understand what Kenny is tasking you to do as, just like in South Park itself, it’s difficult to understand exactly what he is saying.</p>



<p>Like the other South Park quests, completing these tasks provides CRED and Memberberries to advance the Born in Chaos mini pass. However, they won’t appear or be completable until you complete four of the Cartman quests. If you haven’t completed the stages before that, there’s a fair bit of grinding ahead of you.</p>



<p>A full list of the quests is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Kenny Quest</th><th data-align="center">How to Complete</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpphmmph</td><td data-align="center">Visit the zipline tower in Battlewood Boulevard</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmmpmpph mmhhmph</td><td data-align="center">Get Eliminated</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpmphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get revived by teammeates three times</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mphmmph mhhmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get 10 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmh mpphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Travel 200m in the air</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpph mhppmmph</td><td data-align="center">Hire a Specialist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-do-kenny-s-quests-in-fortnite-expire">When do Kenny’s Quests in Fortnite expire?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests will remain available in Fortnite until the end of the South Park collab on February 6.</strong></p>



<p>That gives players plenty of time to tick off all of the tasks and claim all of the rewards before they disappear, though, if you do miss out, the items could return to the Item Shop in the future.</p>



<p>Kenny’s quests are not the final batch coming to Fortnite before the end of the collab, either, as Part 6 will arrive on January 29, providing more tasks to complete.</p>

            <p>Mawning all and happy new week to the sickos who celebrate the return of Monday. It’s time for another helping of cosmic despair as we slide irresistibly down the Gullet of Entropy, pawing in vain at the Tonsils of Hubris. Also, some new PC game releases. Maybe save your pennies for Wednesday and Thursday, which are uncommonly rammed. </p><!--more-->
<h2>Monday 26th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s time for John Highguard to guard high in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Highguard</a>, the Keighley-anointed sci-fantasy raid shooter that has attracted more critical writing pre-release than most games get in total by virtue of 1) it being made by former Apex Legends and Titanfall devs 2) nobody knowing a goddamn thing about how it plays</li>
<li>Oh no, John Highguard has been sucked into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319730/Winnies_Hole/">Winnie’s Hole</a> (early access), this being a frightful cosmic horror roguelite based on the hitherto-cuddly A.A. Milne character. Battle through the Hundred Acre Forest as Winnie while mutating his insides using block-shaped viruses. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 27th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>For many years now, people have been trying to make ‘Minecraft survival with airships’ a thing, and failing. I don’t understand why it hasn’t caught on. I love airships. Anyway here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644050/Echoes_of_Elysium/">Echoes Of Elysium</a>, launching into early access with six player co-op and a “vast procedural clockwork world”.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 28th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">Roots Devour</a> you are the absolute worst tree. Extend your tendrils through the forest, drinking the blood of non-sylvan lifeforms and deciding whether to merely witness or prey upon a furtive population of humans.</li>
<li>DON’T LET THEM IN unless they genuinely just want to buy pasta and chips in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3762550/HELLMART/">Hellmart</a> - a horror game about being a supermarket clerk, in which smiling customers are to be regarded with suspicion.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3278310/LANESPLIT/">Lanesplit</a> is a glossy first-person biking sim by twilight with a touch of the Nicolas Winding Refns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">Ghost Keeper</a> (early access) appears to be a new version of polterzeitgeisty Sims parody Ghost Master. Set up a houseful of haunts without getting exorcised.</li>
<li>Seek out a mysterious signal at the heart of post-apocalyptic Antarctica in slightly Funko Pop-esque survive-o-wander <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054310/Nova_Antarctica/">Nova Antarctica</a>. You'd think vanilla Antarctica was already apocalyptic enough, but they had to go the extra thousand miles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 29th January</h2>
<ul>
<li>There have been over 30 Resident Evils and we’ve still yet to kill all the videogame zombies. Here to finish the job, maybe, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795540/The_Midnight_Walkers/">The Midnight Walkers</a> (early access), a first-person extraction shooter set in a megamall with a timed poison gas system.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/">Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</a> is the self-explanatory sequel to/escalation of Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Cairn</a> is a thoughtful, heavily-laden climbing adventure from the makers of Furi and Haven.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">Don’t Stop, Girlypop</a> is a Y2K arena shooter with sherbet in its veins, a crystal flip phone in one hand, and some kind of pink chrome lipstick launcher in the other.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362060/CODE_VEIN_II/">Code Vein 2</a> is Bandai Namco’s latest anime Soulslike with a time-travelling, fix-the-past-to-save-the-NPC premise and some crackpot character designs and outfits. There is a bell-waving octopus gunship and your sidekick’s corset is an X-ray screen. Discuss.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 30th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">Half Sword</a> (early access) is a grimdaft physics-based medieval combat game in which you swing by moving the mouse. Expect much clanging and some entrails.</li>
<li>It’s time for a remake of turn-based mech bonanza <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3795900/FRONT_MISSION_3_Remake/">Front Mission 3</a>. Ah, I remember playing this briefly on PS1. I think I was lured away from it by Alundra 2, in the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question for the comments thread: how do I stop Steam game pages autoplaying trailers when shuffling the top media display? It routinely scares the pants off me when I have several tabs open. Some day, Gabe Newell will pay for his crimes. In the shorter term, the RPS team are spending this week thinking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, Yakuza, Arknights Endfield and various secret things.</p><p>What are you up to? Nothing good, I hope. Let us know if there's a recommendation-worthy game we've skipped. I left a few out because I'm utterly aghast at your apathy on this front. Don't let me tell you what to like. Show me you have guts and a little spine! Not like the lady in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/code-vein">Code Vein</a> 2, though.</p>

<p>Your Code Vein 2 efforts will be in vain without knowing the Code Vein 2 trophy list. Imagine getting all the way through the game and not knowing a crucial piece of information or encountering a missable trophy? The game’s trophies and achievements will test you.</p>



<p>Finishing a Soulslike deserves a physical trophy in itself. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a> isn’t going to be easy, and anyone could tell you that, judging from the first game and what was shown before launch. In addition to the relentless difficulty and dastardly obstacles Bandai throws at you, there are plenty of extra things to do through trophies and achievements.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Nothing to worry about, right? Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can find 36 trophies and achievements to earn throughout your Code Vein 2 journey, with Xbox owners only getting 35, due to the PlayStation’s Platinum Trophy counting as extra.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not an exhausting amount from the outside. However, the reality is that bosses, exploration, and upgrading abilities and items to the maximum is going to take time. Make sure you’ve got plenty of free time for this one!</p>

So, while other titles are expected, Undisputed will be February's main addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undisputed is expected to become available on February 3, for PlayStation Plus subscribers across all tiers from Essential upwards. As ever, it should remain available for a month, until March 3. We'll follow up with February's other PlayStation Plus Monthly games whenever Sony announces them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">January's PlayStation Plus Monthly games are of course currently still available to claim, including Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Core Keeper and Need for Speed Unbound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in October 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, Undisputed is notable for being the first major licensed boxing video game in over a decade, since the EA-published Fight Night Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Developer Steel City Interactive's approach to boxing in Undisputed is on the right track, but there's a long road ahead of it," IGN wrote in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-review">Undisputed review</a>, which returned a 6/10 score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its emphasis on realism, preparing for fights using RPG-like mechanics, and creating an adrenaline-filled experience in the ring are significant building blocks. Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Ashly Burch, who voiced Chloe Price in the first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game, says her character and that of Max Caulfield will "always have a special place" in her heart, despite the actress not returning to the series.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Deck Nine lifted the lid on the next series entry, Life is Strange: Reunion. Reunion is billed as the "thrilling finale to the Max and Chloe saga", which began over 10 years ago with the eponymous Life is Strange.</p>

<p>Since Life is Strange's original story from 2015, the character of Chloe has appeared twice more: once in 2017's prequel Before the Storm, and again in Reunion, which is set to debut later this year. However, unlike the original, Chloe in these two games is voiced not by Burch, but by Rhianna DeVries.</p>
<p>Now, speaking with Eurogamer following Reunion's reveal, Burch says she doesn't "know a lot about this project", but regardless, Max and Chloe's characters still mean a great deal to her, and there is no doubt that they always will.</p>
<p>"I wasn't asked to reprise my role as Chloe, so I'm learning about Reunion at the same time as the fans," Burch tells me, before adding she is "grateful people still care so much about these characters".</p>
<p>Closing, Burch says: "Max and Chloe will always have a special place in my heart."</p>

<p>As well as Life is Strange, Burch has also lent her talents to a myriad of other projects across games, films and TV. This includes Borderlands' Tiny Tina, The Last of Us Part 2's Mel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">Aloy in PlayStation's Horizon series</a>, and many more. In addition, Burch is the creator of the YouTube series I'm Happy You're Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashly-burch-gets-into-bed-with-puppets-to-talk-about-mental-health">which she describes as "like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but for adults"</a>, about the many mental health hurdles we face today.</p>
<p>As for the Life is Strange series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-reunion-will-be-the-thrilling-finale-to-the-max-and-chloe-saga-coming-march">Reunion is set to arrive on 26th March</a>, across Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Work on Banjo: Recompiled, a PC port of the iconic N64 platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, had been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-decompilation-project-for-banjo-kazooie-is-now-100-complete.968472/">advancing in the background</a> for a while now, but no one was expecting a shadow drop. That's happened now, and we're impressed by the full list of features.</p>
<p>Wiseguy, a modder who'd already worked (alongside a team) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIp7C2ro2T8">Zelda 64: Recompiled</a>, an adaptation for PC of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, shared the trailer on 24th January via his own YouTube channel:</p>

<figure>

<a aria-label="Banjo: Recompiled Release Trailer (Banjo-Kazooie PC Port!)" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0906Cz-59eU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0906Cz-59eU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>The nearly-four-minute look at the ambitious port isn't just a gameplay reel, as custom scenes and text boxes in the style of the classic game tell both veterans and curious newcomers about all the new features (and even a few surprises) added to this <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>-based version of the game.</p><p>In humorous and colourful fashion, we're told about high framerate support (60, 120, and "whatever FPS you want") and even adjustments for ultrawide monitors. Moreover, the custom options menu is full of settings for general, graphics, controls, and more. It really achieves the feeling of an official port or traditional remaster, alternative control schemes included.</p>
<p>The most surprising reveal comes with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom">Doom</a>-themed puzzle that confirms full mod and custom level support. New content will supposedly be easy to make and throw into Banjo: Recompiled for those with the right tools and knowledge, so expect more on that front fast. "We're getting one step closer to a community made Banjo-Threeie," one comment under the trailer says. Looking at <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-brutalist-jam-iii.549/">other ambitious projects</a> born out of preservation efforts, that's entirely possible.</p>
<p>Banjo: Recompiled also works out of the box on Windows, Linux (also SteamOS), and Mac. You can grab it <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp">here</a>, but you'll need a "copy of the North American 1.0 version of the game" that's been previously dumped from a cart you own, as the port loads the assets from the original game release.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c51be720f7b91"><a title="Age of Imprisonment" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c51be720f7b91/age-of-imprisonment.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Koei Tecmo <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir6_20260126e.pdf">has confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> has now surpassed <strong>1 million copies sold</strong>.</p>
<p>This comes via key financial data (thanks, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19438-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-sales-numbers-1-million-copies">RPG Site</a>) in which Age of Imprisonment is listed with a note stating 'Over 1 million copies sold worldwide' when translated. Seems pretty clear to us!</p>
<p>The game launched on <strong>6th November 2025</strong> exclusively for the Switch 2 and tells the story of the Imprisoning War referenced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. It still has a little ways to go to surpass <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> on Switch at 4 million copies sold (at least!), but we have to keep in mind the much larger install base of the Switch compared to Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2siyhrw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Overall, it's a great start for the game, and it thoroughly deserves to see sustained success.</p>
<p>Plans to make Age of Imprisonment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lets-make-it-nintendo-and-koei-tecmo-on-the-genesis-of-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">came to fruition quickly</a> for Koei Tecmo and Nintendo, with producer Yosuke Hayashi pitching the idea after playing Tears of the Kingdom during the weekend immediately after launch.</p>
<p>We gave the game a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">9/10 in our review</a> and called it the "best entry in this spin-off franchise to date".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> may be the best selling Blizzard game of all time, according to the LinkedIn profile of an Activision Blizzard employee.</p>
<p>Lauren Ashling Hill, Activision Blizzard's communications lead for Northern Europe, states as much in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-ashling-hill-4a194837/">LinkedIn bio</a>. It describes Diablo 4 as "the best selling Blizzard game of all time". This bio also describes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II as "the best selling game in CoD history".</p>
<p>We already knew that Diablo 4 was the fastest selling Blizzard game of all time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-says-diablo-4-is-its-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time">as this fact was announced by Blizzard itself back in 2023</a>. Within a few days after its early access release, the game racked up over 10,000 years of play time according to Blizzard, an eye-watering figure for the series and studio.</p>

<p>Since then, Diablo 4 has undergone plenty of quality-of-life changes and gained multiple expansions, including the most recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred major content update</a>. Later this April, its Lord of Hatred expansion is set to launch adding a new class, a new region, and other goodies.</p><p>It should be no surprise that Diablo 4 is selling boat-loads, given the series' history of high player demand. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> was certainly no slouch when it came to bringing home the bacon, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5972671/diablo-3-activision-blizzard-pc-sales/">selling at least 20m copies back in 2014</a>.

<p>Midway through last year, the Diablo 4 team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-diablo-team-forms-union-seeking-protection-in-wake-of-microsoft-layoffs">looked to unionise following widespread layoffs across Microsoft's gaming division</a>, which did impact various staff within Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">thanks to the company being acquired by Microsoft back in late 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Are you one of Diablo 4's many, <em>many</em>, players? Let us know in the comments why you think it's proven to be such a big hit for Blizzard.</p>

		<p>Developer Vedinad has released a new update for Megabonk, with update 1.0.64 bringing hats into the game, so you can style your character even more. There are 21 hats in total, some new achievements, and a new Megachad skin. The new update also addresses a save and progress bug, where players have had progression reset due to errors with Steam Cloud or the game having issues. The fix is a new setting in settings which will use Steam achievements to recover lost progress, though it won’t be perfect.</p>

<h2>Megabonk update 1.0.64 update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>21 Hats and Achievements<wbr></li>
<li>New Megachad skin</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You can see what items you have banished in the pause menu and when opening a chest / shrine<wbr></li>
<li>Stats now show while holding tab and showing map<wbr></li>
<li>Added a little window in the Unlocks tab in the main menu showing what stats are upgradable and useful for different weapons (suggested by NintenDoingIt on reddit). Also shows all stats unique to each character</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Pots / Vases now give a little luck, which scales with the stage, suggested by nate_codes. I think it’s a fun suggestion, as it incentivizes collecting pots, which increases value of good movement and map routing, as well as Movement speed stat and Pumpkin item. Let me know what you think<wbr></li>
<li>Slightly buffed Robinette’s passive in late game. Damage per 1k gold after 1M gold: 2.5% -&gt; 3.5%<wbr></li>
<li>Feathers now give about 10% more speed forward when jumping, as well as giving +1 jumps<wbr></li>
<li>Bone now has higher default knockback (1.25 -&gt; 1.5) and no longer has Knockback as an upgrade offer, but instead has Crit Chance and Crit Damage<wbr></li>
<li>Shotgun now has higher default knockback (2.5 -&gt; 3) and no longer has Knockback as an upgrade offer, but instead Crit Damage<wbr></li>
<li>Vlad now has 5% Lifesteal (flat) added to character stats<wbr></li>
<li>Robinette now has 5% Gold Gain (flat) added to character stats<wbr></li>
<li>Spaceman now has 5% XP Gain (flat) added to character stats<wbr></li>
<li>You can now obtain a max amount of 25 Za Warudos per run</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some issues with certain characters heads or hats clipping through Santa Hat<wbr></li>
<li>Items no longer tick / proc in the order they were obtained. They are now ordered by the name of the item (enum name specifically). This is just to make the game more consistent, and make it so that the order you pick up items doesn’t actually matter.<wbr></li>
<li>Proc Order: BloodyCleaver, Bonker, Dragonfire, EagleClaw, GloveBlood, GloveCurse, GloveLightning, GlovePoison, GlovePower, GrandmasSecretTonic, IceCrystal, IceCube, LightningOrb, MoldyCheese, QuinsMask, SluttyCannon, Snek, SpicyMeatball, UnstableTransfusion<wbr></li>
<li>Xp shards now have a little size difference so you can tell the better xp shards apart from the normal ones<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an annoying thing where if you are in-game and moving forwards or backwards as you level up and the level-up screen shows, it no longer moves your cursor selection with that old input you used for movement<wbr></li>
<li>Can spin the character in the Character Selection to see them from different angles. Use Mouse or Controller Shoulder buttons / triggers<wbr></li>
<li>Lowered the volume of Scythe a bit, as it was too loud<wbr></li>
<li>New setting in Effects tab: Enemy Attack Indicator Color – Allows you to change the color of the red spheres that indicate where an enemy attack will hit<wbr></li>
<li>New setting in Effects tab: XP &amp; Gold increase text – Toggle the small text next to your player that shows how much xp and gold you gained</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some errors caused by Steam Rich Presence, which might’ve stopped achievements from working properly sometimes in-game<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where if you had more than 350 items, it would sometimes fail to upload your score to the leaderboards<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a pretty big bug with Dicehead where if you received multiple levels at once from a big chunk of XP, his passive would only trigger once…. yikes (thanks to Noll Reed for the find)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Chunkers was only affected by its own Projectile Speed stat on the weapon itself, and not by the Player Stat (also Noll Reed)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Joe’s Dagger Execute sometimes did no damage (also found by Noll Reed…)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Roberto’s ghost chests would spawn inside of walls on the Boss Stage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could get 5 tomes or weapons with auto leveling enabled (found by メープル)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where minibosses would spawn under the map (reported by virgules)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a default game setting that caused some lower fps and a translations error (reported by Justicetom)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where poison could sometimes bring you below 0 hp and kill you (found by Snek)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some projectiles didn’t properly change their opacity<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Spicy Meatball and Bush’s passive Bullseye would keep multiplying its damage with the Elite Damage Multiplier for every Elite Enemy, and also applying this amplified damage to normal enemies, instead of just applying that damage multiplier to the individual elite as it should.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a UI bug in the “Unlocks” window, where the buy button would overlap with the achievement description<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where hats would not be affected by the shield outline<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where money would keep circling you and not be picked up… at least i think its fixed<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could stand on the invisible floor below the final boss arena<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the front swing of Corrupted Sword and Hero Sword only damaged one enemy<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Rollerblades didn’t work properly after teleporting to the next stage</li>
</ul>

		<p>The bobcat is back as Bubsy returns in a brand new platforming game from Atari and studio Fabraz on May 22nd 2026.&nbsp; Bubsy 4D will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, Windows and GOG, and Xbox Play Anywhere, and probably your smart fridge and Nokia 3310 if they have enough time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bubsy 4D - Official Physical Pre-Order and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpZg1FJgc4k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will be the first Bubsy 3D adventure game since 1996 (the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/02/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-review/">2017 reboot</a> was a side scrolling platformer) and it finds the wisecracking bobcat on the hunt for the Golden Fleece, which somehow has been stolen from Greek mythology and is now in the hands of the alien BaaBots. I think this is a case of “Just go with it, it’s a video game”.</p>
<p>Busby will be bounding around alien planets themed around fabric and crafts and will be meeting up with some old pals from previous games including Terri, Terry, Virgil and Oblivia.</p>
<p>“Get ready for the comeback you never saw coming,” said Bubsy T. Bobcat. “It’s no secret that I’ve got a questionable track record, but Atari and Fabraz are determined to give me the game I’ve always deserved. This time, my claws are out and I’m ready to show off.”</p>

<p>The digital version will cost you $19.99 but you can <a href="https://atari.com/products/bubsy-4d-deluxe-physical-edition?variant=47396647698597">pre-order a collector’s edition</a> ofBubsy 4D&nbsp;for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. The physical edition, which includes a game cartridge, tuck-in exterior box, user manual, poster and artbook, for $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 on Nintendo Switch and $49.99/€49.99/£44.99&nbsp;on Nintendo Switch 2</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a> have revealed the final signature count for their European Citizens' Initiative, dubbed Stop Destroying Videogames. According to the folks behind the campaign, the European Union have been able to verify that 1,294,188 of the petition's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">nearly 1.5 million signatures</a> are the real deal, putting it above the one million signature goal required for EU politicians to look into the issue of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">server shutdowns rendering online-only games impossible to play</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Things are moving quite fast right now, and we’ve decided to share the final count with you ahead of schedule," volunteer Moritz Katzner wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qluxts/stop_killing_games_final_count_of_verified/">a Reddit post</a> which includes a breakdown of the verified signatures by country.  "Originally, this wasn’t possible due to certain background limitations, and our plan was to wait until shortly before our next meeting with the EU Commission.</p>
<p>"At that point, we intended to reveal everything through a video, alongside a redesigned website, a restructured Discord, and several other updates that - ironically - I still can’t talk about just yet. We didn’t want to present our case unprepared, unintentionally leak information to lobby groups, or worst of all burn out our team."</p>
<p>According to the breakdown, the largest signature total a single country contributed to the petition was 233,180 from Germany, followed by France with just over 145,000, and Poland with around 144,000. Katzner expanded a bit further on the relatively low number of signatures - at least in the context of the overall total - which have turned out not to be valid.</p><p>"I’d say we’re definitely in the top three when it comes to low rates of failed signatures," he wrote in a comment on the post. "We’re sitting at around 10%, while the best-performing initiatives tend to fall in the 10–15% range, which puts us firmly in the upper bracket. Some initiatives see failure rates as high as 20–25% and still manage to get over the line, but it’s worth noting that the overall sample size is quite small, only 11 initiatives."</p>
<p>While a wait for the campaign's organisers to begin meeting with EU lawmakers and properly discussing the issue looks to be on the cards for now, the group have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qlknp0/stop_killing_games_announcement_on_anthem/">seperately announced plans</a> to "take some proactive steps" with regards to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-private-server-experimentations-underway-as-the-shooters-subreddit-mods-rethink-retirement-plans">recent shutdown</a> of Bioware's online-only exoshooter Anthem. Those steps have taken the form of providing intructions as to how Anthem owners in France and Germany can report the shutdown to relevant consumer rights organisations. The hope is that getting in touch with the <a href="https://www.quechoisir.org/">Federal Union of Consumers - Que Choisir</a> and <a href="https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/">Verbraucherzentrale</a> might help those who bought the game secure refunds, with establishing "more generalised international reporting mechanisms for any games killed in the future" being one of Stop Killing Games' goals going forwards.</p>
<p>The Stop Killing Games campaign was the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">a debate in UK parliament</a> late last year. Recently, a small group of UK Green Party members <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/uk-green-party-mps-would-be-compelled-to-support-stop-killing-games-if-a-proposed-policy-amendment-passes">revealed plans to propose an amendment to policy</a> which would "compel" their MPs to support Stop Killing Games, were it to pass a vote at the party's next conference.</p>

<p>A new announcement for the devs has revealed that Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition has been delayed indefinitely, with no new release date announced. </p>



<p>Back in September 2025, Koei Temco surprised fans with an announcement trailer revealing the return of a beloved 2001 title: Dynasty Warriors 3. The Remastered edition is recreated in Unreal Engine 5, with striking new visuals and other significant upgrades. However, it seems that the developers will need more time to bring it to the level the fans deserve. </p>







<h2 id="h-dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-delayed-with-no-new-release-date">Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Delayed With No New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS/status/2015726489149276652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the official Koei Tecmo America account announces the delay of Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition. It was earlier scheduled to arrive on March 19, 2026, and now a new release date will be announced at a later date. The producer of the upcoming title has revealed that, as this is the first remaster of the series, they would like more time to “fully satisfy” the fans and “improve the quality of the game”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered includes the original game and the Xtreme Legends expansion. The upcoming title will feature a cast of more than 40 officers, with iconic 1 vs 1,000 action sequences all redone for modern systems. Additionally, the Xtreme Legends comes with new stories, bodyguard customization, new weapons, and four types of challenge modes. Check out the announcement trailer below: </p>

That's also just over $4 for each booster ($4.17, to be precise), which is more than a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, the market price for these is still sitting around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8lWq?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$139, according to data at the trusted resale marketplace TCGplayer</a>. While this will likely continue to drop (fallen 45.71% in the past three months), you're certainly ahead of the trend if you pick up the preorder at Amazon right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, just a heads up, as it's important for those looking to buy: Amazon doesn't charge until dispatch (so your card won't be charged until closer to release on March 6. Plus, the retailer also has a preorder price guarantee, so if it drops even further or somehow goes<em> back up </em>in price, you can be absolutely certain that you're paying the lowest price possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-months-away-but-play-boosters-are-discounted-already"><u>This is also even better than the deal we saw just before Christmas</u></a>, and now even lower than the next best price at Amazon from earlier this month ($148.20). Although it does make you think, is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set? Let's hope not!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but dropping even further to just $125, this seems like a mighty good deal for what is already looking like a very popular set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJe7m?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man</a>, which would be a little worrisome if <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8mKK?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avatar</a> hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.

            <p>Filming for Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> is currently underway in the UK.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, footage of Alien and Avatar actress Sigourney Weaver on location in London started making the rounds. Now, I will be the first to admit this new footage doesn't tell us a <em>great </em>deal, with the images and videos circulating merely showing Weaver standing on the roadside in the Big Smoke, but as a massive Tomb Raider fan, I am excited nonetheless.</p>

<p>Weaver will play Evelyn Wallis in the Tomb Raider series, with her character described as "a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents". Even from just the short clip of the actress on set, which you can see below, Weaver is definitely giving off villain vibes. There is something about the sharp collar and business attire that screams 'I am scheming'.</p>
<p>For those who have seen the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikanders-tomb-raider-film-from-2018-just-made-it-onto-netflixs-top-10-ahead-of-series-30th-anniversary-this-year">Tomb Raider film with Alica Vikander from 2018</a>, I am getting the same vibe from Weaver's character as that of  Kristin Scott Thomas' Anna. You can see how Weaver looks as Evelyn Wallis below.</p>
