			<p>The latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator continues to improve Bloodborne's performance on PC, fixing a critical issue and more.</p>
<p>As showcased by GAMESMARK in a new video, version 0.4.1 of the emulator, which is not yet available to the public, runs the game with full audio and no longer requires a mod workaround to work properly. Performance seems to be extremely solid as well, as the game runs at 4K resolution and around 100 FPS on a system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, an RTX 4070 GPU, and 32 GB of DDR5 RAM.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne PC Huge Progress (Audio Finally Working Without Mod) ~ ShadPS4 v0.4.1 WIP - FPS Unlocked" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yFfO-FLJzE?start=6&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest public version of the ShadPS4 emulator, which is finally making it possible to enjoy Bloodborne on PC after it has been stuck on PlayStation 4 since its release, was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-4-0-download/">last week.</a> The 0.4.0 version of the emulator packs tons of improvements and fixes, including shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more. This version of the emulator also runs Gravity Rush Remastered, another game that is not currently available on PC, without any workaround.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

Under normal circumstances it lets each player who does well enough to appear on the podium perform an emote, most of which are either toxic or hilarious depending on your point of view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 isn’t the first Call of Duty to feature The Winner’s Circle mechanic, as it’s appeared in the likes of Black Ops 3, Infinite Warfare, and WWII. But it’s impact feels particularly pronounced this year, and the debate around it was only exacerbated by the recent release of fan-favorite map Nuketown, which in addition to the Play of the Game and the Winner’s Circle, shows a short cutscene of the map getting nuked before players return to the lobby.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/call-of-duty-20241105104414-1730804227350.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Winner's Circle has proved divisive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of issues players have brought up with Black Ops 6’s Winner’s Circle. The main one is the time it takes to view: players have to sit through the Winner’s Circle whether they make the cut or not, and the handful of seconds it lasts can feel like an age when all you want to do is get into another match or check your loadout. Because of this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1f61rz0/the_winners_circle_is_so_fucking_goofy_please_let/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players have called on Treyarch to add a skip button or even pull the Winner's Circle from the game entirely</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the issue of toxicity, with some saying the ability to taunt your opponent after a victory discourages them from continuing to play having just lost a game. The slow camera zoom into the top player's face doesn't help matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-the-changes-coming-to-multiplayer-for-launch-based-on-feedback-to-the-beta">Treyarch actually nerfed the Winner’s Circle following feedback from the Black Ops 6 beta</a> so it had a shorter overall duration and “mitigated emote spam” for launch. During those preview weekends, players were able to spam emotes in the Winner’s Circle, which was certainly more frustrating to watch. Currently, you’re only able to trigger one emote. Or at least, you’re only supposed to be able to trigger one emote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have worked out that they can still spam emotes here by quickly pausing and unpausing the game. Doing this, they’re able to fit in a few emotes into the Winner’s Circle before it closes, which, yeah, is pretty annoying to watch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But! If you’re sick of watching the shenanigans that go on in the Winner’s Circle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gj6dx2/pro_tip_you_can_close_the_winners_circle_by_going/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players have worked out they can make the player avatars disappear by heading to the in-game social tab</a>. This doesn’t make the Winner’s Circle go away any quicker, but it does get rid of the emotes, if you’re feeling particularly put out by them. It’s a bizarre glitch that Treyarch will probably patch out at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been interesting to see how players have reacted to the Winner’s Circle since Black Ops 6’s explosive launch. Some have said they don’t mind it, given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gj6dx2/comment/lvb0lmr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it provides them with a bit of time to check their phone</a> before being thrust into the next match (modern gaming!). Others really, <em>really</em> hate it, and want to skip it at all costs. “Goofy” is a word I’ve seen tossed about by many in response to these emotes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the ongoing debate about Black Ops 6’s Winner’s Circle, it seems unlikely that Treyarch will strip it out of the game or even let players skip it. It provides an opportunity to show off players’ elaborate and often costly cosmetics, including premium emotes, to all players still in the lobby — and we all know how crucial cosmetics sales are to Activision’s bottom line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re jumping into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Multiplayer Tips and Tricks</a> to help you get started.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-is-unlikely-to-be-revealed-before-the-end-of-the-year.1027716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is unlikely to be revealed before the end of the year, as the official announcement of the system during a critical season could significantly impact the company.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda commented on the yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that making an announcement before the end of the year has gotten quite difficult, as Nintendo would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical end-of-year shopping season.</p>
<p>Given how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/">last quarter has been pretty underwhelming for Nintendo</a>, the statement from Yasuda-san makes quite a lot of sense, as the Japanese company will want a much better quarter to close out the fiscal year before going all-in with the Nintendo Switch 2. A reveal in the first few months of 2025 also suggests that the console will indeed not launch anytime before April 2025, something that was also suggested by a report from August, which revealed that multiple developers were told not to expect the console to launch in early 2025.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 other than that it has been in the works for a while. According to leaks, the console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">shouldn't look too different</a> from its predecessor and should support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> and Ray Reconstruction, which would let it deliver solid performance and possibly better ray tracing than other current-generation systems.</p>

            <p>Much the same as anyone with a soul, I find ants deeply fascinating and, much the same as anyone who occasionally drops small pieces of sandwich on the floor, I will continue to uphold my respect for them as long as they come nowhere near my feet. Yes. I admit it: I am a bug hypocrite, loudly extolling their virtue and beauty at a distance then getting irritated if they decide to come sit on me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, real time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-the-ants">Empire Of The Ants</a> understands that the best place for insects to be is inside a screen, where they can be appreciated but cannot under any circumstances touch you. It’s out this week, as it happens, and here’s a new launch trailer to celebrate. Follow your pheromone trail to the video below.</p>

<p>It is gorgeous, isn’t it? Like a Big Dave doc, minus Big Dave himself, which doesn’t sound that amazing now I type it. I’m especially into the bit where the ant says he’ll “assemble the legions immediately”, which feels a disastrously silly interpretation of how ant communication actually works, but is too much fun for me to get upset about. Also, worth pointing out that Empire Of The Ants is not to be confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth">Empires Of The Undergrowth</a>. One has a big frog in it, and the other has a big football. Easy. Also, this one has pvp. Any other notable features? Let’s ask the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287330/Empire_of_the_Ants/">Steam page</a>!</p>
<blockquote><p>Experience an immersive journey and defend your lands through tactical and strategic battles in an epic, microscopic world. Play as 103,683rd, an ant of the warrior caste with an inquisitive mind: explore the Federation and fight for it, conquering new territories. Exploring, strategizing, and forging alliances with the local wildlife will be crucial to emerge victorious from the many challenges lying ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here are a few features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Shape your strategy by choosing your roster wisely: starting, support, and super-predator legions.</li>
<li>Upgrade your nest’s tier to access new and stronger legions. Will you opt for the defensive Snail or the mobility of the Rhino Beetles?</li>
<li>Adapt your strategy by building the right chambers: build your economy, manage your legions, gather Information on the battlefield, gain new Powers, or strengthen your Defense.</li>
<li>Not enough space? Conquer other nests to expand your territory and get stronger.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>You’ll be doing all this in a “20 hour campaign”, based on Bernard Werber’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Ants_(novel)">novel of the same name</a>. When you’re done with that, there’s 1v1 matchmaking and three-way free-for-alls. If you’re undecided about this one, it releases in just a few days on the 7th of November, and I guarantee you there will be several let’s players doing the worst David Attenborough you’ve ever heard, alongside at least one doing a really good one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> update, released last night, accidentally introduces a few new issues - including chickens that mysteriously disappear.</p>
<p>The 1.6.9 update - which was released alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-version-16-console-release-date">1.6 for consoles</a> - adds a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">new friend to retrieve lost items and more</a>. However, there have been some cases of players losing their chickens when they start a new farm on the Meadowlands farm and open the door to the coop on the first day.</p>
<p>Stardew Valley creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has said that a fix for this, for the time being at least, is to make sure players leave the door to the coop "closed for one day". Then - not that he needed to but I love that he has - <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514">Barone</a> blamed the chickens' disappearance on a "wild coyote" nosing about the farm on day one. What a cheeky blighter (the coyote, not Barone).</p>
<p>Barone has already released a patch - known as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/4445708897933590775?l=english">Update 1.6.10</a> - on Steam and GOG that addresses the rogue chickens, as well as some crashes. This update will arrive on other platforms "as soon as possible", Barone said.</p>

</p></div>

<p>So, after all this is sorted, what is next for Barone? Earlier this year, the creator admitted he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hadn't actually touched his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - "in a long time"</a>, because his focus had been on Stardew Valley.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone previously said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a year and a half since PureDark <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-elden-ring-is-out-now-delivering-substantial-performance-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his Elden Ring NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation mod. The paid mod allowed GeForce RTX 40 Series owners a significant performance boost in the notoriously badly optimized game developed by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>However, everyone else without an RTX 40 Series GPU has been out of luck so far. That changes with the recently released free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/6794?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR Frame Generation and Temporal Super Resolution (ERSS-FG) mod</a> by Nexus Mods user huutaiii.</p>
<p>This mod supports AMD FSR 3 Super Resolution and Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and even Intel XeSS. The modder shared a few caveats: this is mutually exclusive with their previous ERSS2 mod (which did not support Frame Generation); the Frame Generation feature is not compatible with ReShade; and, most importantly, you can't play online on official servers with this mod enabled.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here's the recommended installation method for this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extract the attached file's content into the ELDEN RING\Game\ directory (including ERSS-FG.dll, dxgi.dll and the folder ERSS2; the file ERSSReShadeStub.addon can be removed).</em></li>
<li><em>Disable Easy Anti-Cheat, either by putting cmd /c start eldenring.exe &amp; rem %command% in launch options in Steam or by using some other tool.</em></li>
<li><em>For Steam Deck (Linux) users: cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="eldenring.exe"; WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;dxgi=n,b" "${cmd[@]}"</em></li>
<li><em>Set Resolution in the game's Graphics menu to <span>.</span>r target resolution (i.e. your monitor's resolution)</em></li>
<li><em>Open the mod's configuration overlay with the Home key, set Frame Generation method to AMD FSR then restart, and set Super Sampling setting to the upscaling technology of your choice</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several known issues with the current release of this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Flickering global illumination, most visible in shaded areas</em><br>
<em><strong>Workarounds</strong>:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Restarting the game may make it go away temporarily</em></li>
<li><em>Using the GI Glitch Mitigation options in Advanced Settings -&gt; Frame Generation (which may reduce frame rate slightly depending on which option you select)</em></li>
<li><em>Rolling back NVIDIA GPU drivers to version 552.12</em></li>
<li><em>Using DXVK + VKD3D (doesn't support DLSS on Windows)</em></li>
<li><em>Setting Global Illumination to Low can reduce the intensity</em></li>
<li><em>Some reported that turning on Ray tracing can make the issue go away.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Game UI color is slightly off &amp; requires manual configuration in HDR</em></li>
<li><em>There may be some glitches on non-16:9 resolutions outside of the main 16:9 screen area</em></li>
<li><em>Conflicts with other overlay mods (using standalone installation method)</em></li>
<li><em>Cannot be loaded by adding to Special K plug-ins. It can run alongside SK with the included DXGI.dll loader albeit with some issues</em></li>
<li><em>FSR FG + Special K: if Elden Ring's screen mode is set to Full-screen, the game will constantly try to reset it's output swap chain causing flashes</em></li>
<li><em>The Special K overlay is invisible</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Even with these caveats and issues, this might still be useful for those who have been waiting for the right time to dive back into Elden Ring and play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>.</p>

            <p>
Early reactions to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> multiplayer range from frothing dislike through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-ops-6-leak-gives-naughty-players-get-access-to-the-max-payne-ish-omnimovement-system-for-the-first-time">omnimovement hype</a> to our own Ed Thorn's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">dead-eyed appraisal</a> that it's "a good one, I think. Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this." I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that "Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too." The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The fix for players spawning right after joining matches in progress, without the courtesy of a loadout selection screen, sits alongside "general spawn logic tuning across several maps for improved spawning". In the latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4">Blopsblog</a>, the developers caution readers that "spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment", adding that "our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes." 
</p>
<p>
How safe can a spawn point be, before it starts to confer an unfair advantage? I'm interested to read more about how spawn systems work. I picture the Black Ops 6 spawn system as a genetically engineered octopus, floating in a tank over model of each map. The octopus has been specially trained to place spawn points on demand by touching the map with each tentacle, but being an octopus, it sometimes loses interest or decides to chew on a small model of an AC-130 gunship instead. They keep the octopi in the same room as the thousands of monkeys they've got trained to typewriters, striving to write the perfect Call Of Duty campaign. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8">It was the blurst of times indeed</a>.
</p><p>
In the room along from the octopi/monkey chamber, there's a room full of budgerigars who dynamically alter the game's weapon balancing by screeching "assault rifle", "submachine gun" and "shotgun" at different volumes. The new patch makes some "early, general changes" to the effective ranges of assault rifles and SMGs. "For ARs, we are pulling in minimum damage ranges and lessening the impact of headshots at close range," it reads. "SMGs are receiving damage range increases to improve their mid-range effectiveness."
</p>
<p>
As for shotguns, shotgun slugs to the body will no longer cause one-hit kills for the foreseeable. The developers say that this particular shotgun attachment "performs better in hip fire than intended" - it's supposed "to offer an alternate playstyle for shotguns that trades close quarters effectiveness for improved range and precision".
</p>
<p>
As noted, the patch also temporarily donates a set portion of safehouse funds to campaign players affected by a glitch that causes "extreme positive or negative currency values". I do like Black Ops 6's safehouse. Wish there were more to it, really. I want to be able to play actual tunes on that piano. But I'll leave it to Brendy to deliver the final verdict, there - he's been working on our Black Ops 6 campaign review while Ed tackles the multiplayer.

            <p>
Nintendo has lowered its sales projections for Switch hardware and software, as the company faces one final Christmas focused on its current, aging platform.
</p>
<p>
Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.
</p>
<p>
After more than seven years on sale, the Switch stands at 146.04m units sold, just 8m shy of the Nintendo DS, the company's best-selling gaming device.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, released just before the end of September, shifted 2.58m copies before the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
Other recent releases to sell over a million copies include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> (1.94m) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> (1.57m).
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, the Switch's evergreen bestseller, sold another 1.37m copies, and remains by some margin the console's best-selling game. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's final sales update of 2024 paints a picture of a company on the cusp of announcing much-needed new hardware - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-year-fiscal-year">provided no new word on when that announcement might arrive</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo eventually ends up calling it, is expected to finally launch in 2025 and will be announced before the end of March.

			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has witnessed a fantastic launch, probably the franchise's most successful entry, as it captured the attention of over half of the US Xbox Series S/X players.</p>
<p>Well, it won't be wrong to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to put behind all the woes we had with Activision and partners in terms of their take on the franchise since the newest entry has managed to break all previous records, in terms of the anticipation and hype. During Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/">recent earnings call</a>, CEO Satya Nadella verified that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">established new franchise records</a> and has been described as the "biggest" release of the Call of Duty series.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis by Circana CEO and analyst Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7suuurekr2l">via Bluesky</a>), it is now revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to grasp the attention of "one out of every two Xbox Series S/X players," which is indeed a massive achievement for the franchise, given that the Game Pass inclusion has surely worked out for Activision and partners.</p>
<p><em>According to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, on Oct 23rd, 19% of US active Xbox Series players and 18% of US active PlayStation 5 players launched Call of Duty HQ. </em></p>
<p><em>On October 28th, 52% of active XBS players and 34% of active PS5 players did so. Both were all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ.</em></p>
<p>Despite Xbox users having an edge with Game Pass access, PlayStation users weren't left behind at all in the hype, as one-third of the active PS5 consumer base were involved in checking the title out, showing that Activision is getting love from all gaming platforms. Not just the US, but the title did manage to draw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">largest traffic ever for a game in the UK</a>, and while we haven't seen any metrics surface, the indicators clearly show that the cumulative player count is going to be a phenomenal one.</p>
<p>It is surely exciting to see the Call of Duty franchise making a massive comeback, and the Xbox-Activision partnership has definitely catalyzed the increase in player count due to the ease of accessing the title through Game Pass.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 is Still Planned to be Announced Before April 2025, Says Nintendo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-is-still-planned-to-be-announced-before-april-2025-says-nintendo.1027677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo has announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 is still scheduled to be announced during this fiscal year.</p>



<p>The news came following Nintendo’s latest earnings call. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa announced that the company will “make an announcement about the successor of the Nintendo Switch this fiscal year.” This means that the company still currently intends to make the announcement by March 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Signs of fatigue over the original Nintendo Switch are beginning to show, too. During the same <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor call</a>, Nintendo announced that the company is lowering its hardware forecast after sales declined in Q1-Q2 year-on-year by 31%. Nintendo now expects the Nintendo Switch to sell 12.5 million units in its fiscal year, down from its initial 13.5 forecast; a 10% reduction.</p>



<p>As for exactly when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released remains to be seen, but earlier this year, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had already announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will not be released until Nintendo’s next fiscal year</a>, which starts April 1, 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prototype designs of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> leaked online, including specifications for the new console, which will feature 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a>&nbsp;resolution.</p>

That’s a 17% revenue drop and a whopping 69% profit drop versus the same quarter last financial year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that last year was a big one for Nintendo, with the release of the Super Mario Bros.

This year, however, has been notably lighter for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo sold 4.72 million Switch units in the six months ending September 30, down from the 6.84 million sold during the same period last year. That’s a drop of 31%.

Paper Mario Thousand-Year Door, released in May, sold 1.94 million units, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, released in June, sold 1.57 million units, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, released in September, “got off to a good start,” Nintendo said, with sales of 2.58 million units. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell incredibly well, with another 2.31 million units. It’s now up to an eye-watering 64.27 million sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, Nintendo failed to say anything about the Switch 2, but did say it plans to continue to push the Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By continuing to convey the appeal of Nintendo Switch, we try to not only put one system in every home, but several in every home, or even one for every person,” Nintendo said. “Another objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch even longer and we can maximize hardware sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch games include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership later this week, and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in January 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Anusak Laowilas/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If you were expecting to hear more about Nintendo's next console, which has been dubbed '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>', during today's latest financial report from the company, I am sorry I am going to have to disappoint you. The company has made no new announcements regarding its Switch successor.</p>
<p>It does still plan to share more on its next console before the end of this fiscal year, however. That all remains the same.</p>
<p>Following the release of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf">latest earnings report</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa affirmed the next console will be announced by the end of March, 2025.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely that this announcement will happen before the end of the calendar year, however. According to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda, making a new console announcement before January "has gotten quite difficult" for Nintendo, he told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>. "You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season," Yasuda reasoned.</p><p>We got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">official confirmation of Switch 2's existence back in May</a>, when Furukawa first said the company planned on sharing more on the upcoming console "this fiscal year". At this time, Furukawa tempered expectations, adding we would not be hearing any more about the Switch successor during its then scheduled summer Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>But, while we don't have an official look at the console, we know developers are now openly working on games for it. Meanwhile, several announcements recently have suggested games are coming to Nintendo's future hardware, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-remaster-headed-to-ps5-xbox-and-nintendo-platforms-so-switch-2">Yooka-Replaylee</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-gets-first-confirmed-release-in-my-time-at-portia-sequel">My Time At Evershine</a>.</p>
<p>It was once said Nintendo wanted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-successor-reportedly-due-late-2024">launch Switch 2 in late 2024</a>. Plans have, evidently, now shifted, and a report in August suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Nintendo's next console won't launch before April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during last night's financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">Nintendo revised down its expectations for total Switch console and game sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A new sole drop event has now started in Pokemon TCG Pocket, with players able to take part in the Lapras ex Drop Event. This event is focused on the solo battles portion of the game, where players face off against the AI in order to complete challenges. Much like other solo events, the Lapras ex Drop event has four tiers to it, which are beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For the first two levels, beginner and intermediate, it seems the only rewards you get are tokens and shinedust. However, on the advanced and expert battles you get access to winning a Promo Pack A Series Vol.1 pack, which contains one of five promo cards. These are Butterfree, Pikachu, Mankey, Clefairy, or Lapras ex. You will only get one card out of these packs and I, unfortunately, got two Mankeys. Your luck may be better. This event is running until the 18th of November.</p>
<p>The Lapras ex drop event is running alongside the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/01/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-event-part-1-has-started/">Pokemon TCG Pocket Wonder Pick Event Part 1</a>, in which players have the opportunity to pick promo A Chansey and promo A Meowth from Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>

What’s more, maker Edmund McMillen has announced that the foretold online co-op update is due on the 18th of this month, alongside a “considerable” balance update. Consider me considering the considerability of said considerable update!</p>

<p>“Isaac online will feature a full online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mode (with completion markers) alongside a considerable balance update that heavily focuses on buffing items you guys believe are lackluster/bad,” <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">Ximbled McMillen</a>. The game has had local mate mode for a while now, but BinHeads have been anticipating this online update since McMillen said it was coming “soon” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-binding-of-isaac-is-getting-online-multiplayer-soon">last year</a>.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou will be able to play with random matches or friends” - four of them - confirmed executive producer Tyrone Rodriguez <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">at the time</a>. Also confirmed were tracked winstreaks, the ability to load up specific seeds, and one item per player for boss rooms and treasure chests.</p><p>McMillen’s Xeet also features a load of concept art, boss designs, and storyboards, so worth having a looksie if you’re a real BumHead. “TBOI takes over people's lives, despite being a short and entirely beatable game, because every new combination of random enemies and random items manages to feel like a brand new adventure, infinitely more important than any you've had so far,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review">wrote</a> Alec Meer (RPS in peace) back in 2014.</p>
<p>McMillen is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> - a game I’ve been waiting for since it was announced over a decade ago. The last we saw of the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> feline fuse ‘em up was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shaky-cam-footage-emerges-of-edmund-mcmillens-turn-based-cat-tics-mewgenics">this here shaky cam footage</a> last year. The creator has previously described the game as "like a bunch of things, but not like anything else. It really feels like Final Fantasy Tactics meets Pokémon meets some sort of D&amp;D-type adventure game, with an Animal Crossing hub". Stop. You had me at cats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Here's something we weren't expecting: Age of Empires II Definitive Edition might be about to launch on PlayStation consoles. The rumor comes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1gibltj/aoe2_joins_ps_confirmed_or_graphics_bug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the franchise's subreddit</a>, where someone spotted players supposedly joining a multiplayer match from Sony's platform, possibly while testing the port. Truth to be told, The Verge's Tom Warren did hint it could happen in a newsletter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted </a>a few months ago:</p>
<p><em>As part of Project Latitude, Microsoft has also been considering launching Age of Empires II Definitive Edition on rival consoles in early 2025, and its upcoming remastered spinoff, Age of Mythology: Retold, could come, too.</em></p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> two months ago, earning an 8/10 score from Wccftech's Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Age of Mythology Retold brings back a classic with new - great - visuals, a new UI, and a few new gameplay features. While it does, for the most part, feel more like a remaster, there's still an incredible amount to love here, and the few new features the army of developers have added bring a whole new level to the game.</em></p>
<p>Age of Empires II Definitive Edition is much older, though, having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly five years ago. Granted, developer Forgotten Empires has continuously provided great support for it, releasing six expansion packs (Lords of the West, Dawn of the Dukes, Dynasties of India, Return of Rome, The Mountain Royals, Victors and Vanquished) while a seventh called Chronicles: Battle for Greece will launch on November 14.</p>
<p>It's also the remaster of the most acclaimed game in what is arguably Microsoft's longest-standing franchise (except for Flight Simulator). In that regard, it would be peculiar to see it on the rival platform, though Microsoft has long <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its strategy when it comes to exclusive games. In fact, more Xbox and PC exclusives are expected to launch on PlayStation 5 in the near future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter.1027638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Nintendo reported its latest quarterly financial results to investors. The previous trend of weak Switch sales has continued: the hybrid handheld/home console sold only 2.62 million units this quarter, for a lifetime total of 146.04 million units as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The quarterly Switch sales decreased by 10.58% year-over-year. A similar result was seen regarding quarterly software sales (39.6 million units), which dropped by 10.66% compared to last year's quarter. Out of the new games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> has sold 2.58 million units, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake</a> sold 1.94 million, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> reached 1.57 million.</p>
<p>In this underwhelming quarter, Nintendo's operating profit went down by 29.07% year-over-year. Moreover, the company cut its forecast for the full fiscal year from 13.5 million Switch units to 12.5 million units:</p>
<p><em>Although Nintendo Switch hardware and software unit sales through the first half of the fiscal year were both below our initial expectations, many people continue to play with Nintendo Switch even in its eighth year since launch. For hardware, by continuing to convey the appeal of the Switch, we try to not only put one system in every home, but several in every home, or even one for every person.</em></p>
<p><em>Another objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Switch even longer and we can maximize hardware sales. For software, in addition to Super Mario Party Jamboree, released in October, we have other titles planned for release, such as Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership (November) and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (January 2025). Other software publishers plan to release a wide variety of titles, and we will</em><br>
strive to invigorate the platform by continually introducing new titles in addition to the existing titles.</p>
<p><em>We have modified the Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales unit forecasts for the fiscal year in consideration of the sales trend through the six months ended September 30, 2024.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, analysts weren't exactly thrilled with the Japanese corporation's performance. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/nintendo-sees-bigger-profit-decline-on-faltering-switch-demand?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Bloomberg</a>, Toyo Securities's Hideki Yasuda said:</p>
<p><em>The Switch is at the end of its shelf life, and even software sales are weak. If this trend continues, the Switch’s momentum will drop even further.</em></p>
<p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games added:</p>
<p><em>Nintendo overestimated the appeal of their 2024 software pipeline, which has no real blockbusters but several filler games. Looking at the software still coming out this fiscal year, I believe the adjusted hardware and software sales forecast is still too high.</em></p>
<p>None of this is surprising, as the whole industry and market are waiting for the announcement of the Switch 2. However, Nintendo seems content not to hurry.</p>

<p>Teresa Lynch, a professor at Ohio State University, has completed and published a study that examines how elements of sexualisation and <strong>strength </strong>impact our view of female video game characters. In a two-pronged study that put 677 participants to the test, Lynch and her team assembled a series of female characters and had users study and play as them for a set time.</p>



<p>These female characters were created with four categories in mind, all of which were centred around various levels of sexualisation and strength – for instance, a highly sexualised but weak character versus a low sexualised but very strong character.</p>



<p>The results of the study were intriguing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mommy-theory">The Mommy Theory</h2>



<p>Think of all the users who fell in love with Resident Evil Village’s Alcina Dimitrescu despite her towering size and imposing, terrifying presence, and you’ll effectively arrive at the outcome of this study help by the Ohio State University.</p>



<p>Teresa Lynch’s team created four characters on Soulcalibur VI, focusing on their breast size, hip-to-waist ratio, clothing, weapons, and musculation. They were created to specifically fulfil four roles. Speaking on the reasons behind the study in the first place, Lynch said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to understand how gender socialisation and prejudice like sexism inform video game development and player experiences. </p>



<p>Sexism pervades gaming. For example, game content overwhelmingly features male characters to the exclusion of central female or gender minoritised characters. Games that do feature female or gender minoritised characters often unfavorably stereotype and objectify these groups.</p>



<p>I want to know more about why, when, and how these kinds of outcomes happen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, a two-pronged experiment was produced. First, the team had 239 students view and rate these four characters, indicating which they preferred based on appearance alone. Per expectations, users accurately rated the characters based on their level of sexualisation, while noting that the ‘tougher-looking’ characters appeared more formidable.</p>



<p>Simple.</p>



<p>That’s where things took a turn, though. The participants in the study, most of whom were female, determined that a character with high sexualisation and high strength was <strong>more sexualised </strong>than characters just designed as ‘eye candy’. It was concluded that strength in a sexualised female character only serves to accentuate their attractiveness, rather than degrading it.</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00936502241279625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The study</a> also showed that female participants were less favourable to the strictly sexualised characters and preferred those with a combination of good looks and a strong build.</p>



<p>Mommy? Sorry.</p>



<h2 id="h-part-two">Part Two</h2>



<p>In the second part of the study (which was picked up first <a href="https://www.psypost.org/new-research-on-female-video-game-characters-uncovers-a-surprising-twist/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by PsyPost</a>), 438 students were put to the test, playing as one of the four characters for ten minutes on Soulcalibur VI.</p>



<p>The participants fed back that playing as a strong female lead aligned them less with ‘stereotypical femininity’, and it also made them feel as though the character was more competent. In the gender split, female participants gravitated more towards the sexualised characters, while male participants leant more into the ‘strong but less sexualised’ creations.</p>



<p>One of the most damning findings from the study was that while females bagged on sexy female characters, they were more likely to prefer playing as them when it came down to the live test session. </p>



<p>In a parting statement, Lynch said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re also very interested in understanding the positive impact of female characters on players, not just the drawbacks or negative side. People play video games because they like them and find the experiences entertaining, but also because they have meaningful experiences. We’re exploring that side of things because it’s all part of the same question.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you think? Do you lean more towards sexualised female characters like Stellar Blade’s Project Eve, or are you more inclined to pick a physically imposing female character like The Last of Us Part II’s Abby?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Invests In Using AI To Build Games After Closing Down a Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-invest-ai-gaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-invests-in-using-ai-to-build-games-after-closing-down-a-studio.1027614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-invest-ai-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In October, Netflix shut down ‘Blue’, an internal studio dedicated to developing games for the streaming platform. This studio was led by former Blizzard talent and was tasked with creating AAA games, but before producing anything and mere months after a recruitment spree, the studio was shuttered by Netflix.</p>



<p>In recent months, Netflix’s success in the gaming space has come from porting third-party games onto the platform – like the GTA Trilogy. Netflix said at the time that it’s not turning its back on gaming, but it has now been confirmed it’s going in a different direction entirely.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transformational-technology">‘Transformational Technology’</h2>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Netflix’s new VP of GenAI for Games, Mike Verdu, revealed his fresh placement and explained why this is ‘the future of gaming’.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At long last, I am ready to talk about what I’m doing next: I am working on driving a “once in a generation” inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verdu explained that GenAI ‘is the next challenge’ on the road to unlocking the ‘unlimited potential and rapid pace of innovation’. He views generative AI as a wave that’s going to hit the gaming industry with an impressive force, despite many viewing ‘this technology with fear’.</p>



<p>He also offered a harsh line against those doubting Netflix’s presence in the gaming space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you’ve seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately for Verdu, the comments <a href="http://linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on his post on LinkedIn</a> were rampant with those lashing out against this business decision. The justification for scrapping a studio and laying off workers to invest heavily in GenAI just isn’t there for some. It’s not the first time we’ve seen this in the last year or two, though – but it never gets any easier a pill to swallow.</p>



<p>One user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>I appreciate your effort to quell speculation regarding Netflix’s changes in its gaming division, but recent events deserve a critical look.</p><p>The closure of Team Blue after only two years, without releasing a single game and with the departure of key figures like Chacko Sonny and Joseph Staten, suggests a lack of strategic consistency.</p><p>Additionally, while generative AI holds potential, many perceive its current use as more of a marketing tactic than genuine innovation.</p><p>In the context of layoffs and restructuring, the community expects tangible outcomes rather than just bold headlines. I trust that these challenges will lead to a more solid and demonstrable plan in the future.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Other titanic developers, such as Electronic Arts, have spoken boldly about the future of AI in game development. There are some predictions among executives that AI will soon be responsible for an extremely high percentage of development activities, which paints a scary picture for those on the outside looking in.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission.1027611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much of the Slitterhead gameplay revolves around Rarities, gifted humans who can achieve higher attunement with the mysterious Night Owl and maintain their consciousness while being possessed, which allows them to use some unique fighting styles and skills that can make your life easier against all sorts of opponents.</p>
<p>Unlock new Rarities is also a necessity to proceed in the main campaign, as you will need the help of specific characters to continue Night Owl's war against Slitterheads. The first time this happens is right after starting to investigate a religious cult that seems to be bringing together monsters and humans, and you will need Edo's help to proceed in this investigation.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241031011038_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you are notified of needing a new Rarity to proceed through the story, play the Parasite Mission 2nd round mission again. At the start of the mission, proceed normally until you reach the main street. Walk around until you hear two NPCs talking about a stray dog and a homeless man. Continue past these two characters, and you will find the stray dog, who is the same one you have met at the very start of the game. Possess it, follow the scent like you did at the beginning of the game, and you will eventually reach the homeless man named Edo. Possess the character, defeat the Slitterhead, and he will join Night Owl in his quest. Quit the mission, and the Hidden Cave RE 2nd Loop mission will be unlocked.</p>
<p>Besides being required to proceed through the story, Edo is an extremely strong Rarity to use if you enjoy fighting Slitterheads head-on, as he is a close-range fighter that can dish quite a bit of damage, deflect attacks automatically, perform a quick dodging maneuver, and increase attack power with his skills. He may not be a looker, but he sure knows how to deal with enemies!</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/">Slitterhead</a>, Hyoki and his Rarities will have to fight a variety of enemies of the supernatural kind, but there will be times when regular old humans will get in their way, leaving them no choice but to use their special powers to take them out and continue their hunt for the vicious Slitterheads. These humans, however, are very different from the Civilians that Hyoki can possess and will fight back with everything they got.</p>
<p>During the Oppressive Force mission, you will encounter members of the S.P.E.U., a military unit out to destroy not only Slitterheads but also Hyoki. Dealing with them is considerably different than dealing with the monstrosities you have fought before, and you will have to adapt to the situation and use completely different strategies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031121432_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, always make sure to take advantage of any cover you can find.&nbsp; If you're unsure where they are, just press the LB button to slow time and survey your immediate vicinities, possibly possessing any Civilian or Rarity placed near covers. The members of the S.P.E.U. tend to attack relentlessly, so if you're caught outside of cover, you will receive a lot of damage.</p>
<p>As for taking these enemies out, you can employ a variety of different strategies, which depend on the Rarities you have brought to the mission and the Passive Skills you have learned. A very effective strategy involves two of Alex's unique skills: Blood Well and Time Bomb. The first is used to draw together every character in a certain radius in a single point. At this point, possess one of the attracted Civilians, use the Time Bomb skill, and possess another character far from the one that activated the skill to watch them explode and damage everyone in their vicinity. If you bring Anita, you will have no lack of Civilians to blow up, thanks to her Devil's Scent skill. The War Cry skill also works quite well with this strategy, as this Civilian Skill attracts the attention of any nearby enemy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031122458_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to make dealing with humans armed to the teeth in Slitterhead even easier, you should have one of your Rarities learn the Possession Rush passive skill. This skill, which is always active as long as a Rarity who has learned it is present, allows any possessed character, whether it's a Rarity or a Civilian, to unleash a powerful attack after being possessed by Hyoki as long as the enemy is in front of the camera. By hopping from one character to the next, you can easily deal with multiple enemies easily as long as you handle the camera properly. This is an excellent strategy to deal with S.P.E.U. members armed with shields. Possess an NPC located behind their backs, unleash the Possession Rush skill, and watch them fall dead.</p>

<p>Whether you believe it or not, COD Mobile actually has quite the competitive scene. With many large tournaments held across the world, the game has grown immensely in popularity, but what about its ranked system?</p>



<p>Here are all the COD Mobile ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-mobile-all-ranks-from-worst-to-best">COD Mobile: All Ranks from Worst to Best</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>COD Mobile does not follow the traditional ranked system, such as the Bronze, Silver and Gold ranked system. However, it does split some of the ranks listed above into different levels.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-rookie">Rookie</h3>



<p>Rookie is the lowest rank in COD Mobile, where many gamers start out. Here is every Rookie rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-veteran">Veteran</h3>



<p>Following the Rookie rank is Veteran (which seems like it should be the name for the top rank). Here is every Veteran rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Veteran I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-elite">Elite</h3>



<p>Elite is the next rank in COD Mobile, which also is split into multiple segments. Here is every Elite rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elite I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-pro">Pro</h3>



<p>Considered the middle rank in COD Mobile, the Pro rank is filled with players who probably play the shooter game regularly, so if you make it this far, then consider yourself a COD gamer.</p>



<p>Here is every Pro rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pro I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-master">Master</h3>



<p>Master is the next rank in COD Mobile and the first one without any split segments. Once you hit Master, you will not have to worry about progressing through the rank. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-grandmaster">Grandmaster</h3>



<p>Grandmaster is the second to last rank in COD Mobile, meaning you will need to be quite the gamer to make it this far. However, it is not the last and will be extremely difficult to rank up from here.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-legendary">Legendary</h3>



<p>Legendary is the rank all COD Mobile gamers strive for, but very few ever hit. It takes quite a few COD points to make it this far, so if you are ever good enough to hit Legendary, take yourself out for a nice steak dinner to celebrate.</p>



<p>Jump into COD Mobile now and start ranking up so you can hit Legendary.</p>
