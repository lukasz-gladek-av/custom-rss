<p>In what was definitely not on my bingo sheet but one I was not-so-secretly wishing for, we’ve heard about an upcoming trailer for State of Decay 3, which will be released during the Xbox Games Showcase. We’re not yet sure if it’s gameplay or another cinematic, like the one they revealed over three years ago, but here’s hoping for the former!</p>



<hr>



<p>This leak stems from developer Undead Labs updating their website with new branding and information to better align with their standing as a first-party Xbox game development studio. Xbox purchased Undead Labs in 2018, following the immense success of their original game, State of Decay, which became a cult classic. Their follow-up, State of Decay 2, continues the franchise, offering a highly replayable zombie survival game of immense quality and entertainment value.</p>



<p>But now, it’s time for something more. In a press release leak that fell through the cracks during the website update, we know there’s a new State of Decay 3 trailer reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. Here’s what the press release had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>IT’S A NEW ERA FOR UNDEAD LABS.</p>



<p>Undead Labs engaged with 51 Eggs, a branding practice, on an odyssey to align the studio brand with its evolution from indie to Xbox. Undead Labs was founded in Seattle in 2009 as a scrappy startup with only a handful of developers. The studio’s name was a clever marketing tactic for the first State of Decay game, a surprise hit that launched in 2013. A decade and a half later, Undead Labs bears little resemblance to its early incarnation. Following an acquisition in 2018, its relationship with Xbox changed from publishing partner to parent company. Shortly after, the founder departed, and new Studio Head Philip Holt began his leadership tenure, including overseeing the expansion of satellite oices in Illinois and Florida. It was time for the studio brand to change. “We wanted to give the creatives we work with a collective identity that transcends zombies,” says Holt. Chief of Sta Vicki Ebberts adds, “It felt right — and also the right time — that our brand reflected how much we’ve grown and changed.” Partnering with brand development experts 51 Eggs proved to be an exciting and rewarding adventure. Collaborating closely with the Undead Labs team, 51 Eggs delivered a holistic, studio values-driven brand experience encompassing everything from brand strategy to verbal and visual brand identity design. The end result includes redefining Undead Labs’ name and brand story, a new logo and visual ecosystem, boot sequence animations, website, custom brand launch kits, interior studio artwork, signage, wayfinding, and more. Over nearly two years, these Pacific Northwest-based companies worked together to explore the studio’s legacy, current trajectory, and the shared dreams and aspirations of its beating heart — the people of Undead Labs. “This rebrand evolves the Undead Labs brand and elevates the role of the game studio brand within the category by building a brand-world that feels substantial and immersive in a way previously reserved for games.” Nate Manny, Founder of 51 Eggs.</p>



<p><strong>Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th, in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer. Explore and experience the new Undead Labs brand at undeadlabs.com.</strong></p>

<p>We’ll share more once the trailer goes live!</p>

<p>I love the setup: you're a duck turned into a human and made an intern of a goddess's "magical startup dedicated to finding lost items". 
</p>
<p>I remember when every hidden object game was a faintly hideous photo-collage about investigating ghost murders in an endless procession of damp sheds. It's been a delight to see the Where's Wallyfication (or Waldofication, if you're American) of the genre in recent years, with a growing number of games featuring richly illustrated scenes packed with humour. 
</p>
<p>Lost And Found Co. seems to be in the same vein as Hidden Folks and Labyrinth City: Pierre The Maze Detective, where it's just a pleasure to hang out in its spaces even when you can't find what you're looking for. I appreciate that there's a story to pull you through each scene, too.
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101390/Lost_and_Found_Co/">the demo from Steam now</a>, with the full game as yet undated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/persona-3-reloads-the-answer-expansion-gets-a-release-date/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=persona-3-reloads-the-answer-expansion-gets-a-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wave 3 of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>‘s expansion pass, Episode Aigis: The Answer, has received a release date reveal trailer. This section of the game will include more than 30 hours of new content and a new dungeon for players to explore as they navigate through an epilogue to the climactic main story. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Fans are excited to see this part of the game be reworked, as it quickly became one of the most controversial aspects of the original <em>Persona 3</em> release. Many players have criticized the pacing of the story, as well as the overall difficulty spike of the original version of The Answer included with <em>Persona 3 FES</em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass | Episode Aigis Date Reveal" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTgAlxQyvkE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">While The Answer was a controversial release, that didn’t stop hungry fans from asking about it when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> was first announced. Many assumed that the DLC would be missing from Reload until a surprise announcement confirmed it would be coming. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Although gamers have come to disagree about the way that <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>changes up gameplay in its own ways with the inclusion of Theurgy attacks and changes to each character’s toolkit, the overall outlook from the fandom is optimism at a chance to see this story executed in a way that feels more natural. </p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Additional excitement stems from the fact that a <em>Reload</em> recomposition of the <em>FES</em> version of Mass Destruction can be heard in this trailer. The trailer also shows off some dungeon exploration, Aigis’ new all-out-attack screen, and a sliver of information about Metis, a focal character in this expansion. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Although some players are still holding out hope to see the female protagonist from <em>Persona 3 Portable </em>be included as a DLC somewhere down the road, most of the fandom is just happy to see The Answer be included in <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, since it was pitched to gamers as a faithful remake. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"><em>Episode Aigis</em> is the third and final wave of DLC for <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> and will be released on September 10, 2024. Interested players can purchase it via their respective stores. Additionally, Xbox Game Pass members have the opportunity to claim Episode Aigis as a Perk through January 31, 2025. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-finals-best-builds">The Finals</a> is a multiplayer first-person shooter about stealing cash and demolishing buildings in a virtual reality game show. Why does it need to be set in a virtual reality game show? So it can do things like transport players to Kyoto in the year 1568, which is what will happen when season three arrives on June 13th.

<p>Here's the season 3 announcement trailer, shown during last night's Summer Game Fest broadcast:

<p>The new season brings a new 5v5 ranked mode, Terminal Attack, in which one team attacks by delivering a decryption key to one of two terminals, while the other team defends them. The mode is designed to empasise "a more tactical and competitive" style of play, with matches being decided by the best of 13 rounds, and with no healing or revives.
</p>
<p>Although set in different cities and slightly different time periods, so far all of The Finals' maps have been modern urban environments. Kyoto in the 16th century, meanwhile, consists of temples, gardens and bamboo forests - all of which you can demolish as per any other environment in the game.
</p>
<p>The setting also brings a set of themed weapons and cosmetics, including dual katanas for Mediums, a spear for Heavies, and a recurve bow for Lights. I love a bow in any game.
</p>
<p>I haven't returned to play it in a while, but I'm still rooting for The Finals. Being able to demolish buildings is fun on its own terms, as are grappling hooks and portable jump pads, but its real strength is making these overpowered tools into tactically significant options in the push-and-pull of its various game modes. I had great fun with it for a couple of months and I hope it continues to draw enough of an audience to keep its servers online.</p>

A demo is available now. <span id="more-890101"></span></p><p>“We’re counting down the days, and the whole team is excitedly awaiting the launch of <em>First Dwarf</em> in Early Access,” said Star Drifters CEO Jakub Wojcik in a press release. “Both the tests and the demo version are immensely popular among players, yet this is just a glimpse of what we aim to deliver to them on June 19 and in further updates. We’re eagerly awaiting feedback from our fans because we want to listen to their opinions and craft our game together with them. We also feel that with the support of the community, we’ll be able to build a title tailored to what players are currently looking for.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Star Drifters:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>First Dwarf</em>, players become Tru— a dwarven explorer who sets out to build colonies on the floating islands of Driftland. Shipwrecked Tru must prepare for the dangers of the sky-high land, building defenses and infrastructure for the future colonists. Fortunately, with dwarven engineering skills, he can repair and pilot a powerful mech, which proves itself in combat, gathering resources and building. With various upgrades, this pinnacle of fantasy tech will eventually become the ultimate exploration machine. The mech’s offensive arsenal will also come in handy, as the uncharted lands are inhabited by mysterious creatures hostile to the dwarven newcomers.</p><p>But the gigantic mech is not enough to uncover all the mysteries of Driftland. Ragna, a she-dragon, is a playable companion who aids Tru in his quest. Her small size, ability to fly, and breathe fire make her a great addition to the dwarven skills of the protagonist. The game can be played in co-op (split screen and online) with each protagonist doing their job.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Building a colony and managing the settlers is another part of Tru’s job. With <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense</a> mechanisms, the settlement can be prepared for the worst. But it’s not all about survival—Tru will have to balance and fulfill the needs of new inhabitants, providing them with resources, shelter, and entertainment to boost their happiness. Only a prosperous society will allow our protagonist to pursue his own personal goal—discovering what evil taints these lands and what happened to the previous dwarven expeditions, including the one led by his father.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li> Control dwarf Tru, pilot the powerful mech and fly with Ragna the Dragon, each with their own skills to upgrade.</li><li>Build, optimize and look after your colonies.</li><li>Upgrade, craft and discover new structures, technologies, tools, and weapons.</li><li>Fight Tainted enemies by engaging in close combat and by building defensive turrets and walls in advance, preparing not only for monster waves, but also natural disasters.</li><li>Heal the Tainted animals or purge the island of them—the choice is yours.</li><li>Unveil the hidden secrets of Driftland and learn the truth about Tru’s father’s past.</li><li>Embark on an <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> alone or with a friend in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> assist mode</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>First Dwarf</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch, and PC via XXX in 2024.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="First Dwarf - Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uvdR-pXNHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/08/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-is-a-new-stealth-game-from-former-mirrors-edge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5sWLWF20uc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>From Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world," studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. "This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some screenshots from the game</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The advertising bonanza formerly known as E3 continues into its second day with another set of streams. The Wholesome Direct was today's highlight, in my mind. The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you'll find the archived stream below.

<p>I like the dark edge of Discounty, which takes the familiar shop simulation loop of stocking shelves and serving customers and puts it to work in service of creating a sprawling - and potentially exploiting and polluting - supermarket. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2274620/Discounty/">Steam page</a> warns that not everyone wants you to succeed, which seems only sensible.
</p>
<p>I also liked Littlelands, a cute action-adventure game about catching bugs, exploring caves, and searching for treasure. It's Zelda by way of Boku no Natsuyasumi, maybe? The announcement during the Wholesome Direct above included mention of a demo that would be playable today, although sadly it seems <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2083660/view/4146206204944399615">the developers have decided to delay it at the last moment</a>.
</p>
<p>Lastly, I loved the look of Spilled!. It's a relaxing game about cleaning up oil spills in your little tugboat, then upgrading the boat, and it has had a playable demo for a while. The announcement here was that its getting a graphics upgrade later this summer, following its successful Kickstarter earlier this year.

This colossal foe introduces a new dimension to combat mechanics, demonstrating that players can not only climb these 25-meter creatures but also battle them mid-flight as they soar around the world. So far, three fire-based Epics, each with distinct styles and abilities, have been revealed. Six more creatures remain to be discovered, each boasting unique appearances and different magical powers.</p><p><strong>Custom Combat Style</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The new trailer also provides a glimpse of the customized armors and weapons players will be able to craft with the loot they gather. In the constantly changing environment that is the Enclave, players will encounter environmental events like flash freezes and droughts, requiring adaptation with the right materials for combat readiness. Players can also define their own playstyle by taking on the challenge of mastering the art of ice, telekinetic, or fire magical weapons.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_890105"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The World is Your Weapon</strong> – At the heart of <em>Eternal Strands</em> is a revolutionary new system for gameplay interactions: heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat.

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.</p>

<p>Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ogIq4hscX0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="432" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The long road to the launch of the anticipated <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is coming to an end, as the official <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fill-your-eyes-with-a-silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-and-its-release-date/">release date</a> was finally revealed last week (with the title, probably predictably, set to come out just weeks before Halloween). But there’s a bit of a stink in the air surrounding the game, and it seems like this modern take on one of the most influential horror releases ever is going to have to be pretty much perfect.</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">In the current era of remakes, remasters, and re-imaginings, it can be easy to feel a little bogged down by an industry that’s too eager to tick the nostalgia box rather than deliver something fresh. However, a quick look at games like <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, and the work Nightdive Studios has been doing on classics like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/quake-iis-nightdive-remaster-is-live-right-now/">Quake 2</a></em> shows there’s still room for it in the market, it seems.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sU3pyYi5hz0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">But despite the excitement that should be surrounding Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, there are a number of doubts that are putting the whole project under a lot of pressure to succeed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-reigniting-the-influence" data-injectable="false">Reigniting the influence</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="776" data-injectable="true">There’s an argument to be made about not fixing something that isn’t broken. As one of the most influential horror games of all time, remaking it is surely a tall order. <em>Silent Hill</em> – especially the second one – has made its mark on the genre, preserved in the annals of gaming history as a staple of how to create something atmospheric with lashings of delicious psychological torment to go with it. To some, the second installment is the perfect horror game.</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say it can’t be done. You only have to look at Capcom’s remake of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> to see there’s scope for revitalizing older games to give them another go in more modern eras. Much like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the original <em>RE4</em> has been hugely influential, which renders a potential remake a dangerous line to tread, but we know it can be done. However, there’s one thing that’s probably crossed people’s minds about it.</p>
 <p data-characters="569" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">What’s the connection between these remade franchises: <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, and <em>Dead Space</em>? They were all done by the developer who created the original. Maybe not the exact same people, but certainly the studio itself. With <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, it’s being made by a different team entirely; one that, although it has a reputation in the horror sphere – as well as being influenced by Team Silent’s work – was not even around when the original was released. Placing a remake of a beloved game into the hands of another is an exercise in trust.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What we’ve seen so far</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-transmission-october-19-2022/">Silent Hill Transmission that took place in 2022</a> had a lot of people excited. Finally, after years of speculation and dormancy, Konami’s horror series was getting new games, a new film, and more attention than ever before. Would this be the triumphant return many of us had been hoping for?</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">But the outpouring since then has left much to be desired. The interactive <em>Ascension</em> has not stood as a bastion of achievement in terms of rejuvenating the <em>Silent Hill</em> name. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-ascension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> is currently showing a user score of 0.8 out of 67 reviews, with the likes of IGN giving it just 50 out of 100.</p> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="true">Perhaps less tragic – though still not really noteworthy – was this year’s <em>A Short Message</em>. Although it’s done better than <em>Ascension,</em> with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-the-short-message/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> review score of 53 and a user score of 6.3, it leaves the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake with a lot of slack to pick up. <em>SH2</em> is not a brand-new entry in the series, but it’s seemingly going to have to do more than coast on nostalgic reputation alone given what we’ve seen of the reemergence so far.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Bloober Team’s track record</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="true">Whatever your thoughts on Bloober Team, the studio has managed to make a name for itself in the horror genre, despite going up against the likes of Naughty Dog, Capcom, and even Frictional Games of <em>Amnesia</em> fame. But this esteem is not without its criticism. Bloober has a knack for visual quality and a disturbing aesthetic that has pricked up a few ears, but there are some problematic things about the developer that people can’t shake.</p>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">This <a href="https://www.techradar.com/features/six-years-after-layers-of-fear-bloober-team-still-cant-get-mental-health-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechRadar</a> article from a couple of years ago laments the studio’s inability to represent mental health in any agreeable way. The troubled artist from <em>Layers of Fear</em>, the protagonist in <em>The Medium</em> who was abused as a child; there’s a sense that the developer uses these angles as a demonizing tactic, and it’s unclear whether Bloober has learned from this. The writer of that article <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/pm86ed/can_somebody_explain_to_me_why_bloober_team_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does not appear to be alone</a> in such criticisms.</p>
 <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Given that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> deals quite heavily with trauma and psychological issues, there’s bound to be concern that a remake from the <em>Layers of Fear</em> studio could encounter similar backlash. However, if Bloober is aiming for a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-faithful-dreadxp/">faithful recreation of the original</a>, then such issues should not be a problem, right? But therein lies a further question: why remake something like-for-like (only with modern visuals and control schemes) without an injection of new sensibilities, mechanics, techniques, the developer’s own flavor, etc.? Answers on a postcard.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">It’s not <em>P.T.</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sabukaru.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">We all miss it. We all wonder what the final product would have been like, especially with Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro’s names attached. Although it’s been ten years since <em>P.T.</em> came and went, it still hangs in the air to some extent, and it’s likely the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake will get compared to the canceled project. But maybe I’m doing Bloober a bit of a disservice.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">A game with such recognition and high praise is going to be the subject of scrutiny when it comes to releasing an official remake of it. Taking a beloved franchise and handing the reigns over to a studio that’s not without its fair share of detractors is likely going to draw a bit of ire regardless. Everyone’s going to be watching Bloober Team on October 8, and I don’t think it’s beyond the realms of possibility that some may be scathing by default.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Personally, I think some of the current negativity surrounding the remake is a little unfair, likely down to a frustrated audience that wants to see this new era of <em>Silent Hill </em>succeed. But I think – judging by some of the YouTube comments posted on the video linked above – things are in danger of bordering on nasty, maybe even verbally aggressive, from a fan base that’s hungry for blood.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="878" data-injectable="true">Maybe there’s some legitimate criticism of what we’ve seen in trailers and teasers so far. <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-2-remake-maria-outfit-sexy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This article</a> dives a little deeper into some of the design choices of the remake, with particular reference to how changing the clothes of Maria detracts from her significance as a duplicitous femme fatale who reminds James of his dead wife. How much of this is simply the wailing sound of “dudebros” upset that a female character has been modernized to look less sexual, as opposed to this new look missing the point of the original’s intent, is not clear.</p>
 <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">At any rate, Bloober is under a lot of pressure to make sure <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is pure and flawless; not one iota less. If it strays too far from the original, it’ll displease the older fans. Similarly, if it’s a 100% retelling of the 2001 release, it’ll feel a little pointless (see also: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1998 shot-for-shot remake of <em>Psycho</em></a>). If it doesn’t straddle the line between freshness and nostalgia, but with a fair representation of the game’s themes, the backlash could be brutal. Honestly, it feels lose-lose at this point.</p>

			<p>At Summer Game Fest, we checked out the tactical first-person shooter game Delta Force: Hawk Ops. The game will feature a premium 'Black Hawk Down' campaign mode and two free-to-play multiplayer modes: the large-scale PvP Havoc Warfare and the extraction shooter Hazard Operations. Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hands-on preview</a>, we interviewed lead developer Leo Yao, who revealed that the game is entering early access in October with a projected release window in early 2025. It will be available on PC (where there's an Alpha test scheduled next month), consoles, and mobile devices.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force: Hawk Ops | Official Summer Game Fest 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WkSYEuGzFss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why did your team decide on Delta Force as the franchise that you wanted to create a new title for?</strong></p>
<p>Delta Force is very popular in China's net cafes. In college, we usually played Delta Force with our friends. When we knew there was a chance that we could acquire the IP, we just rushed to get it. We think this is a very good IP.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe the tactical gameplay that players will experience in Delta Force: Hawk Ops in a bit more detail?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Firstly, we have different Operators who have different skills. The battles are not very arcade-like like some other fast-paced FPS games. Especially in the mode you have played today, the pace is not that fast. You have to observe first, then use some of your team's skills and cooperate with your teammates. In some of the very fast-paced traditional games, like Call of Duty, you just rush and shoot, right?</p>
<p><strong>What modes of communication are there in Delta Force: Hawk Ops, whether it's voice chat, text chat, pinging on a map, or anything else?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We have a good quality-of-life design. We have voice and text chat, and we encourage people to communicate and cooperate at all times. Also, when your teammates get down, you can revive them or move them to a more secure position.</p>
<p>Also, as part of the gameplay of the extraction shooter mode, chests can be acquired. If one of the teammates gets this, all of your team's gonna get a reward to encourage people to collaborate toward a singular goal. Furthermore, it is indeed possible to ping the locations, the items, or the bosses so that all teammates can have a mutual target.</p>
<p><strong>In the extraction mode, can you drop a weapon on the ground and have your teammate pick it up?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But you can't drop very high-value gear to give to your teammates. The risk there is that some of the people would just help the other players by gifting them high-value items, so there's gonna be some of the limitations on that.</p>
<p><strong>To modify or customize your weapon, are you only spending in-game currency, or do you pick up new customization items, like a different scope for your weapon?</strong></p>
<p>We only use in-game currencies.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a gun, can you find a scope anywhere in the world and add it to your gun while you're playing?</strong></p>
<p>If you mean the accessories, those are only bought with in-game currency.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, but can you find the accessories during matches, as a regular item in the extraction mode?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But in the two game modes of Delta Force: Hawk Ops, it's separated. In the large-scale PvP mode Havoc Warfare, there is a progression system where if you level up, you unlock a lot of different weapons and different attachments. In the extraction shooter Hazard Operations, you can loot some of the attachments, and then you can directly use them on your guns.</p>
<p><strong>In Havoc Warfare, as you level up, are you leveling up a specific weapon and unlocking attachments for that weapon, or are you leveling up your character as a whole, which unlocks everything?</strong></p>
<p>I think we support the weapon experience card to unlock specific weapons. So you get a lot of the weapon experience card, which we already use in Call of Duty Mobile, which is very good. People can just get a lot of the experience card after a match and can use that on any of the specific weapons to upgrade it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have something similar to Call of Duty's Pick 10 system for your loadout, where you can only select a certain number of attachments and items to bring with you?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don't have something like that. You can have two weapons with every attachment on.</p>
<p><strong>How do players unlock or earn new Operators?</strong></p>
<p>It's through some of the events or some of the progression systems, but we don't make them premium. All operators are free. You only pay for the cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>Will you have a battle pass?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, we have a battle pass.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have two separate tiers (free and premium)?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The premium battle pass includes a higher level of cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>How long will a season of Delta Force: Hawk Ops last?</strong></p>
<p>For now, it should be one and a half months to two months.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds very similar to Call of Duty Mobile. With a new season, what kind of new content would you add?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, new maps, new operators, new weapons, new vehicles. We did a lot of similar things in Call of Duty Mobile: maps, operators, weapons, and vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>What engine are you using to develop the game?</strong></p>
<p>For the Black Hawk Down campaign mode, we use Unreal 5 because we're using Lumen and Nanite. For the multiplayer modes, we use Unreal 4 because they are also on mobile and Unreal 4 is very good for cross platform.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be launching the different versions simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and we share the progression. For now, we don't encourage people to matchmaking across mobile and PC and console, but we do mix PC and console as the other FPS games do.</p>
<p><strong>If you purchased the premium battle pass on PC, do you get that battle pass on mobile as well?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We share that.</p>
<p><strong>How do you unify the platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Players will use a Level Infinite account.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a release window?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, early access should be in the fourth quarter, and our expectation is that the final release will be in Q1 next year.</p>
<p><strong>How can players enter the early access?</strong></p>
<p>In October, we will open early access on Steam. We also encourage people to give advice or suggestions to us as we listen to the feedback, and we will continue to polish the game.</p>
<p><strong> Can players use keyboard and mouse controls on consoles? </strong></p>
<p>Ah, that's a good question. It is always a very tough question. For now, we only matchmake controller with controller and keyboard &amp; mouse with keyboard &amp; mouse.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to support gyroscopic aiming on mobile?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nice. That is a very popular feature I often use in Call of Duty Mobile. Do you have a target resolution or frame rate for consoles? </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good question. I think we should support 4K. Okay. And the framerate should be 60 at least, and we support unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>Have you talked about which consoles you're supporting, whether it's just current gen PlayStation 5, Xbox Series SX, or are you also supporting PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?</strong></p>
<p>That is a very good question. So, for now we are considering PS5 and Xbox Series X. But we found there is potential to also support PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. I think we hope that we can support all of the consoles, but it's hard work because, to be honest, we didn't have much console experience before. But on PC, we can support very low-end devices like the GTX 960.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to make Delta Force: Hawk Ops Steam Deck compatible?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have that plan for now, but we'll surely support it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the campaign? Like how long it is or how many chapters it will be?</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is basically the Black Hawk Down film. Because we have the copyrights of the film, we use some of the cutscenes from the film.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any of the actors from the film doing voice work?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and we also have the soundtrack of the film. It's a very classic song soundtrack. At first, we only considered a single-player campaign, but now we want to support co-op, maybe at most three people's co-op. It's going to be a very hard campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have the operator system for the campaign, or are you playing one specific person?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don't share the operator from the other two game modes.</p>
<p><strong>Great. Well, thank you both very much for your time.</strong></p>

		<p>Goat Simulator 3 is set to receive its first significant DLC on June 19th, named “Multiverse of Nonsense.” Coffee Stain North announced the DLC at the Future Games Show, introducing a new realm for players to engage with, with the goal of restoring balance to the multiverse by gathering gems dispersed within rifts that lead to all sorts of places.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Multiverse of Nonsense | DLC Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vI5Tll-iujo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, said, <em>“We know what you’re thinking – Multiverse? No one has been bold enough to explore such a complex theme with goats just yet. But that’s what we do at Coffee Stain North. We push the boundaries of next generation goat simulation technology, and we can’t wait for our players to explore some of the most exciting content we’ve worked on since Goat Simulator 3 itself.”</em></p>
<p>The “Multiverse of Nonsense” DLC for Goat Simulator 3 takes players on a journey through various locations such as a cartoon town, a city named Goatroit, where goats act like humans and humans act like goats, and a mythological mountaintop city. This expansion introduces new gear for your goat, and a crossover with another title from Coffee Stain Publishing has been teased, though specifics remain under wrap.</p>

It tells the tale of three protagonists united by fire in their hearts to defy their oppressors. The reveal trailer introduces protagonist Hanna, an adolescent orphan on a quest to find her brother Herman. What follows is a sequence of events that transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring her and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change.</p><p>From a top-down 3D perspective, players will embody <em>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</em>’s three playable protagonists and navigate through the densely detailed streets and dreary underground of the city of Eriksholm, utilizing each character’s unique skills, tools, and weapons to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next step, and execute it with perfect timing. Even an overheard dialogue, such as context-sensitive guard chatter, could prove meaningful in finding the best strategic move to progress undetected, as challenges may have multiple solutions.</p><p><em>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</em> cleverly marries the art of storytelling, stealth, and strategy-based gameplay mechanics to treat players to a riveting adventure with high-production-value visuals, motion-captured performances, and engaging real-time gameplay.   </p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-clan-completes-the-final-shape-raid-unlocks-incredible-final-mission-for-all<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> clan has completed <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a> expansion’s raid, unlocking a final mission for all players that brings to an end the series’ decade-long story that began back in 2014.</p><p><em>This article </em><em><strong>does not include any</strong></em><em> </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for Destiny 2 The Final Shape.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/destinys-decade-long-saga-is-over-after-worlds-first-raid-team-takes-19-hours-to-down-final-boss-unlocking-a-wild-12-person-climax-for-everyone-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> has a great rundown of events up to and including this moment, but for our purposes, we’ll just say that clan Parabellum completed The Final Shape raid before any other and in the process unlocked a 12-person final mission called Excision that acts as a fitting end to everything that has proceeded it over the last 10 years.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Witness has retreated from the monolith - but, an important battle awaits.</p><p>We'll need all Guardians available to help us defeat the Witness, once and for all.</p><p>Rally with us and launch into Excision, a newly unlocked 12-player activity. <a href="https://t.co/HhIky06Vpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HhIky06Vpc</a></p></div>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799420394207605149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But it looks like there is an issue with Excision that is causing players in fireteams to be unable to view all cutscenes upon completion of the Excision activity. In a post on X/Twitter, Bungie recommended players complete the activity solo to ensure they experience all the cutscenes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At this time, we recommend playing the Excision activity solo to experience all the cutscenes. Players who missed the cutscenes can select the Narrative version of Excision to replay them. <a href="https://t.co/lM40N6O4yC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lM40N6O4yC</a></p>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1799486900719538686?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Now that The Final Shape’s main story has come to an end, Destiny 2 players are wondering what’s next. Excision leaves a number of story threads hanging out there in the galaxy, threads Bungie will probably pull at over the coming months. The developer has already announced a showcase set for June 10 at 8am PT in which it will reveal the next year of Destiny 2. That could mean it will touch on The Final Shape’s upcoming three episodes, the first of which kicks off next week. But perhaps Bungie will also hint at bigger things to come.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799426502766796903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In previous videos, Bungie developers have teased that The Final Shape is not the end of Destiny 2 or even the series, with the developer — now owned by Sony — also working on multiplayer game Marathon. This week, in a series of X/Twitter <a href="https://x.com/thislukesmith/status/1797745471521468585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posts</u></a> marking the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director Luke Smith discussed the road to The Final Shape’s release and the effort its developers put in to make it happen. In one of the posts, Smith mentioned the word Hope three times, each capitalized, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches">which was enough to spark Destiny 3 theories within the community</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Our Hope is always the same with Destiny games, expansions, seasons, DLCs, exotic missions, secret missions, in-game events, merchandise, et cetera - we genuinely Hope you enjoy the time you spend with it. Anything we've made or will make, that's the Hope. </p><p>Make your own fate.</p></div>— Luke Smith (@thislukesmith) <a href="https://twitter.com/thislukesmith/status/1797745471521468585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>For now, The Final Shape is going down well with fans, despite initial server problems Bungie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-developer-bungie-truly-sorry-for-the-final-shape-launch-issues">ended up apologizing for</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/why-are-so-many-people-obsessed-with-the-banana-clicker-game/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-are-so-many-people-obsessed-with-the-banana-clicker-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div data-characters="847" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><p><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/thousands-of-people-are-booting-up-steam-to-click-on-a-picture-of-a-banana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We’d previously reported</a> that 30,000 concurrent players were, at some point in the last month, playing <em>Banana</em>, a game that amounted to no more than just clicking the still image of a banana. At that time, <em>Banana</em> had more players than <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo IV</a>,</em> <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fallout-76/">Fallout 76</a></em>, and was close to beating the next game on Steam’s chart list, <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p><p>Those were already historic numbers for such a novelty title, but things have gotten even more out of hand, as the Banana invasion has just crossed over the 142,000-player mark. Because it’s hard to look at a number and understand its real-world implications, I’ll let you know that we’re talking about a single JPEG-based game that’s <a href="https://steamcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently bigger</a> on Steam than <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>, <em>Call Of Duty,</em> <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-grand-theft-auto-v/">GTA V</a>, </em>and is aiming to take <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds’</em> 4th position at 156,000.</p></div> <h2 id="h-so-what-s-special-about-banana" data-injectable="false">So what’s special about Banana?</h2> <p data-characters="625" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true">To be absolutely honest, nothing. It’s not even an original game. In fact, <em>Banana</em> is pretty much the same game as <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784840/Egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egg</a></em>, another JPEG clicker that somehow never managed to reach such heights. Both games are simply about clicking a still image and seeing a number above the banana go up as you click. You could wonder that people are trying to see who scores the most clicks, but that’s not it. On top of its ability to let players pass the time in a relaxed way, what makes <em>Banana</em> tick is the promise of scoring some cash. Yes, it turns out that <em>Banana</em> allows players to make some serious(ly low) amounts of cash.<br></p>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"><em>Banana</em>‘s collectibles work like Steam’s collectible game cards, but there’s a twist. Steam gives you a limited number of cards even if you simply have a game opened on your PC’s background, whereas the bananas you can earn in <em>Banana</em> are limitless. You can earn them by playing the game for a minute, then clicking every three hours, and then you might earn a rare banana once every 18 hours. </p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">On top of them being worth some cash, there are various different bananas, and some of them have names and look fun enough to, at the very least, get an ashamed chuckle out of me.</p> <figure data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/blueralts/status/1790198870997164106"></a><figcaption>Image via Twitter</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Most listings don’t go over a few cents, but a few of them manage to go over the two digits. We’re yet to see if this huge increase in numbers will make these values shoot through the skies, or if anyone actually buys some of the already ludicrously-priced bananas.</p>  <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">Best of all, however, is that despite what it looks like, <em>Banana</em> is completely blockchain or NFT-unrelated.</p> <p data-characters="36" data-current-count="143" data-injectable="false">You too can now go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/">Bananas on Steam.</a></p>

<p>We some a lot of truly whacky video game announcements at Summer Game Fest, including Killer Bean, Squirrel With a Gun, and Cuffbust. The latter is from the same solo developer as Choo-Choo Charles—a first-person horror game about a spider-like demonic train engine. But his latest game looks even better. Here is what we know about the Cuffbust release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cuffbust-coming-out">When is Cuffbust Coming Out?</h2>



<p>While we received countless release dates during Summer Game Fest, sadly, Cuffbust wasn’t one of them. As of right now, we don’t know the Cuffbust release date. We know it’s coming in 2025 for PC, specifically on Steam, but the one-person development studio hopes it’ll launch without issue.</p>



<p>There’s a lot that can go wrong in game development, and even more as a single-person studio, but if this turns out anything like his last game, then it should be a relatively smooth, viral experience!</p>

<p>Cuffbust is a 20-player multiplayer escape game in which you’ll evade guards, plan a prison breakout, and utilize various tools and equipment to make your big break. It’s a bit zany, with plenty of explosives, soap traps, toilet bombs, and spoons in an extremely colorful universe.</p>



<p>You must work together with your team to track guards’ movements, hijack the intercom, destroy generators, disable phone lines, and, in an almost immersive sim-like fashion, find unique ways to escape from jail.</p>



<p>We can see this one becoming big on YouTube and Twitch next year, so now might be a good time to start your channel in preparation!</p>

<p>We saw a number of exciting and interesting projects unveiled at Summer Game Fest, but one stole the show. It’s an odd upcoming action-adventure title made by a single developer, and it’s called Killer Bean. In it, you play as a bean that kills. Revolutionary, right? But when is the Killer Bean release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-killer-bean-coming-out">When is Killer Bean Coming Out?</h2>



<p>While it’s definitely a game on everyone’s radar now, that doesn’t mean the one-man developer over at Killer Bean Studios should rush the experience out the door. As such, unfortunately, we don’t have an official release date for Killer Bean. We know it’s coming sometime this year, specifically this summer, but that’s still a large window.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>While we impatiently wait for this upcoming action game, which features both first- and third-person gameplay, enjoy the most recent Early Access Trailer, which features a whole lot of new gameplay not previously shown off!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-killer-bean-launching-in-early-access-or-full-release">Is Killer Bean Launching in Early Access or Full Release?</h2>



<p>When Killer Bean launches sometime this summer, it will do so in Early Access. The team intends to remain in Early Access for approximately one to two years, no longer and no less, while they iron out the game experience further. During the Early Access period, the team intends to add new features, such as Steam Workshop, and new content every two months.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, they revealed they have zero intention of increasing the price upon full release following the Early Access period, which is definitely not the norm. We’re thankful for that, though!</p>
