A video game getting made into a movie used to have fans bracing for embarrassment, expecting some cheap, unwatchable slop to be dragged out and projected onto a big screen bearing the name of their favorite games. While there are some modern game movies that are still bad, it at least feels like somebody’s trying to make a good film rather than just trying to cash in on a big name, even if they don’t succeed.<br></p><p>I guess that’s one thing we can thank the constant corporate franchise plays for— companies don’t want to sully their brands with a low-effort adaptation, so we get well-made movies like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-is-a-little-weird-but-mos-1841623974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-is-a-little-weird-but-mos-1841623974">the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>series</a></span> and shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golden-globes-the-last-of-us-succession-emmy-awards-1851148385&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golden-globes-the-last-of-us-succession-emmy-awards-1851148385"><em>The Last of Us</em> winning awards</a></span>. But man, there are still some stinkers out there, and even some still being made today. Let’s run through some of the worst video game movies, all while keeping in mind that there are plenty other bad ones we won’t get to touch on.</p></div></div><div><p>Though the 2005 <em>Doom </em>film ended up on our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-best-adaptations-fallout-last-of-us-movie-tv-1851407286&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-best-adaptations-fallout-last-of-us-movie-tv-1851407286">list of best video game adaptations</a></span>, that was only for one scene. The first-person segment which pays a direct homage to the bloody, demon-hunting FPS games that inspired the film whips ass. The rest of the movie is so paper-thin and uninterested in the pillars of filmmaking like character writing, dialogue, and plot that would make it more substantial than a mock-up you’d see as a proof of concept for a full movie. There were hopes for a second film, but it never came to pass. However, <em>Doom: Annihilation</em> was released in 2019, and that wasn’t a direct sequel, but it was also bad. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Tom Holland has been Sony’s golden child since his role as Peter Parker in the MCU, so you can see why they’d position him as the face of another hypothetical hit movie franchise. He’s one of the most recognizable young action stars of the past decade, so if they’re trying to turn <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake into an iconic movie hero to match his video game status, there are worse picks than Holland. However, where the <em>Uncharted </em>movie falls short isn’t with Holland as Drake, it’s with Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan. Where Holland tried his best to capture the swashbuckling spirit of Drake, Wahlberg is playing a character who is wholly unrecognizable from the likable, charismatic father figure that fans know and love. Instead, we get a paranoid bastard who just happens to have his name. The film superficially believes what makes the <em>Uncharted</em> games successful is solely in its big action scenes, several of which it pays homage to like it’s grafting on the best moments of each game into one Frankensteined storyline. As such, it’s content to hand you a bastardized version of the real heart at the center: Nathan Drake’s relationships with the people who follow him to hell and back. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p><em>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li </em>is the kind of adaptation that feels like the people making it had, at most, only a passing knowledge for what they were working with. Yeah, it’s a martial arts film about Chun-Li fighting series antagonist M. Bison and there are other characters who vaguely resemble <em>Street Fighter </em>heroes, but otherwise it’s just a mess of incoherent plot strictly there to facilitate flying fists and spinning kicks. There’s also a wild subplot about M. Bison transferring his consciousness into his unborn child after killing his pregnant wife. What the fuck are we doing here? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>A big reason video game movies have a bad reputation is because Uwe Boll was directing a handful of them in the early-2000s that were so bad they collectively turned the public against them.. Boll’s shoddy work on movies like <em>Alone in the Dark</em>, <em>BloodRayne</em>, and <em>Far Cry </em>became synonymous with why video game movies shouldn’t exist. He wasn’t working on <em>huge</em> franchises that would have had a lot of money behind them (with <em>Far Cry </em>maybe being the exception, though the series has become far bigger since the 2008 film), which meant he churned out a bunch of low-budget slop that set the tone for years of people groaning when they heard a movie adaptation was coming, even if he wasn’t involved. There were even petitions asking him to retire <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/07/news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/07/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2008</a></span>. Boll eventually retired in 2016 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/uwe-bolls-restaurant-is-better-than-his-movies-1793674371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/uwe-bolls-restaurant-is-better-than-his-movies-1793674371">pivoted to the restaurant business</a></span> but has since returned to filmmaking. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Listen, I actually like this movie…or at least remember liking it when I mindlessly plopped into a seat at the theater to watch it. I had no affinity for the games that inspired it and came away from the film thinking, “Well, that was a fun time.” However, I literally do not remember a thing that happened, suggesting its plot and characters were either so bland I spaced on them or so bad that I repressed them. I’ll leave the truth of the matter to you all, but years later I can confirm that <em>Warcraft </em>did not turn me into a convert, or betray any real love for the games it adapted, and that is perhaps the greatest sin of one of these adaptations. It’s just kind of there. —Moises Taveras<br></p></div><div><p>Hoo boy, this one is just depressing. The brand-new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912?rev=1723136128180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912?rev=1723136128180"><em>Borderlands</em> movie</a></span> starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Black, and Ariana Greenblatt isn’t the kind of bad video game movie that will eventually become a cult classic—it’s just plain bad. It’s not even bad enough to inspire hate-watches or spawn memes like <em>Madame Web</em>, which could afford it a sort of second life after what will inevitably be a disappointing box office performance and that’s largely because it is so thoroughly uninspired. The film, which strips the fun out of a universe that already teeters on the precipice of being irreparably annoying, has dialogue that feels like it was written by an AI trained on the tamest corner of Reddit, CGI that deadens a world steeped in color, and performances that have “I am collecting a check” written all over them. I don’t think time will be kind to <em>Borderlands</em>, and it shouldn’t be. — Alyssa Mercante<br></p></div><div><p>Agent 47 cannot catch a break in the film department. Both attempts to make a <em>Hitman </em>movie have been dreadful. The first attempt in 2007 was dragged for its awful writing and was so poorly received that a sequel was canceled. The 2015 reboot <em>Hitman: Agent 47</em> didn’t fare any better, and maybe it’s time for big companies to realize that this might not be the video game series to adapt to a big-budget action film. <em>Hitman </em>is doing well enough as a video game and not everything needs to aspire to a piece of every side of the entertainment business. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a></span><em> </em>has been a resounding success at the box office, the Chris Pratt-led animated film feels like the natural endpoint of a group of suits trying to stuff every focus-tested idea and banal reference into a 90-minute movie. It has its moments like Bowser’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353">now-viral “Peaches” song</a></span> and the titular brothers’ early escapades in Brooklyn before they’re isekai’d into the Mushroom Kingdom, but most of it boils down to references some cynical suit believes will make long-time <em>Mario </em>fans clap. It’s beautifully animated and has some good jokes, but it stops short of including the heart and soul that makes <em>Mario </em>so beloved after all these years. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Injustice </em>movie is both a DC comic and NetherRealm fighting game adaptation and manages to do poorly by both its source materials. The animated <em>Injustice </em>movie is too short to tell the story it’s adapting. Rather than making a series of films to more effectively tell the story of Superman’s descent into fascism, it takes a hard left turn in the final minutes to wrap up the story quickly. I’ll never forget the whiplash of watching this film and realizing that a lot of its strange decisions like killing off The Flash, who typically played an important role in the <em>Injustice </em>storyline, were all meant to make one film in what could have easily been several. If we’d gotten a series of <em>Injustice </em>films rather than one that hurriedly wrapped up a years-long comic and video game series in a brisk 78 minutes, we could look back on it much more fondly. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>I have only walked out of a movie twice in my life. Once was when I was nine years old and saw Jackie Chan’s <em>The Tuxedo</em> because my mother dragged me and my brother out of the theater because she was scared the characters were going to start having sex and she’d have to explain that a few years earlier. The second time was in 2021 when I saw <em>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</em>. And that’s all I have to say about that. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Fighting game movies are some of the most hit-or-miss when it comes to adaptations. You have an easy setup for a lot of action, usually by staging a tournament that attracts a bunch of larger-than-life personalities, but stringing it together with a proper plot is the biggest obstacle for these movies. <em>DOA: Dead or Alive </em>is a prime example of what essentially amounts to actors cosplaying different fighters, beating each other up, and a loose plot barely holding it all together. The <em>Dead or Alive </em>cast gives performances that would barely pass for the worst amateur film you’ve seen, and when the source material was giving them nothing to work with, who can really blame them? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Depending on who you ask, <em>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within </em>is either an abomination or an underappreciated gem. The animated film wore the <em>Final Fantasy </em>brand but is pretty removed from any RPGs that spawned it. <em>Spirits Within </em>was praised for its animation in 2001, but beyond that, it’s generally considered an incomprehensible mess. It bombed so hard at the box office that Square shut down its Square Pictures branch, though it still lives in the hearts of some who consider it a cult classic. Also, damn, looking at the cast list, it had a pretty stacked line-up. Ming-Na Wen? Alec Baldwin? Donald Sutherland? <em>The Spirits Within </em>is wild to look back on. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>If I will give the live-action <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> movie anything, it was that its depiction of the series’ virtual reality simulator the Animus was a pretty interesting way to make what could have been a mostly benign recreation of the source material into something more compelling on film. Instead of having actor Michael Fassbender lay on a bed and dream about his ancestor’s past, the film portrays the Animus as a claw-like machine that allows protagonist Cal to completely recreate the movements and actions of the memories he relives. When he jumps onto a target in his memories, he is able to fully reenact the scene in the real world. It lets the movie do some interesting things as it flashes between realities, rather than spending too long in the past you forget about the present day. But <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> falls into the same problems the games do in that its lack of commitment to one side means both the past and present can feel shortchanged by one another. That’s only more apparent in the movie, as it feels needlessly convoluted as it tries to bring in the series’ lore baggage into what could’ve been a much simpler, accessible film. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Survival mode will be on one server to allow all the children to work together, if they want.</p><p dir="ltr">The project took a few years to complete and was made possible by Mojang Studios and Hive Games, both of which donated their time to ensure it was built correctly.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official Round Based Zombies Terminus Reveal Trailer | New Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Terminus is a nighttime map set on a remote prison island, which continues the Dark Aether storyline from Black Ops Cold War's Zombies. This map features the returning cast of Weaver, Carver, Strauss, Dr. Elizabeth Grey, and the pilot known as Raptor One. More story details and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-terminus-map-trailer-reveals-new-story-details/1100-6525572/">cinematic trailer for Terminus can be found here</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Liberty Falls map is set in a West Virginian town overrun with Zombies. The full map and more details will be revealed during the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_ways_to_play__save__and_join_mid_match">New ways to play, save, and join mid-match</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347621-terminuscrew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347621" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347621-terminuscrew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347621"></a><figcaption>The Terminus playable crew</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347621-terminuscrew.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 Zombies will give the option to play in either first-person or third-person perspectives, with an in-game toggle to switch between views mid-match. Treyarch says third-person will let players see Black Ops 6's omni-movement in a different way.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can now join their friend's ongoing Zombies matches, if there is room in the party. This also means there is an option to rejoin a match if there is a disconnection issue.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also customizable HUD presets to give players more options, including a "Legacy" setting that removes the minimap and positions elements in the same place as the HUD in Black Ops 3.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies also features the new Save and Quit feature for solo players. Solo players have the ability to save a match and quit so they can pick it up later on. Everyone will have one save slot for this feature.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_and_returning_features">New and returning features</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Easter_egg_quests">Easter-egg quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Secrets and Easter eggs are a staple of Zombies mode, and Terminus is confirmed to have a traditional Easter-egg quest for players to solve. Several side quests can be uncovered as well, and players are encouraged to explore the island and uncover hidden secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch describes Terminus as "one of the largest round-based Zombies maps ever created," and says the map offers tactical rafts that players can use to fully explore the prison area, ocean, and smaller islands.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 will include traditional and guided versions of the Easter-egg quest. The game will launch without a guided approach for the main story Easter egg, allowing the community to work together to solve the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the season, players can expect an optional guided version of the main quest. This focused guidance through the main quest will cap the rounds to certain stages of their quest progression. All additional side quests and other Easter eggs will be disabled to prioritize the narrative experience.</p><p dir="ltr">This method of starting with traditional quests and later guided options will apply to the seasonal round-based maps coming with post-launch content.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Classic_Zombies_features">Classic Zombies features</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347624-wonderweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347624-wonderweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347624"></a><figcaption>BeamSmasher Wonder Weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347624-wonderweapon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players can also expect plenty of classic features for Black Ops 6 Zombies, including Pack-a-Punch, the Mystery Box, Wonder Weapons, Wall Buys, Power-Ups, and perk machines.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wonder weapon for Terminus is the BeamSmasher. This is described as being comparable in size and shape to a light machine gun, and it features a single barrel emitting a super-charged and incredibly damaging Aetheric beam with two firing modes.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, Terminus will include the following classic perks with base effects:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Jugger-Nog: Increase maximum health by 100</li><li dir="ltr">Quick Revive: Reduce the health regen delay time by 50%. Reduce the time it takes to revive an ally by 50%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed Cola: Increase reload and armor replating speed bonus by 30%</li><li dir="ltr">Stamin-Up: Increase movement speed</li><li dir="ltr">PhD Flopper: Immunity to all self-inflicted damage and status effects. Dive to prone triggers an explosion, which increases the higher you fall. Immunity from fall damage while diving to prone</li><li dir="ltr">Deadshot Daiquiri: Aiming down sight moves to enemy critical location. Increase enemy critical damage</li><li dir="ltr">Elemental Pop: Every bullet you fire has a small chance to apply a random Ammo Mod effect</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Melee Macchiato is a brand-new perk that replaces the weapon gun butt with a deadly punch that sends enemies flying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347622-perkmachines.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347622-perkmachines.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347622"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 perks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347622-perkmachines.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Field upgrades and augments return from Black Ops Cold War. Field upgrades are the elemental abilities that can be equipped, with Aether Shroud, Frenzied Guard, Healing Aura, and Energy Mine all returning. Dark Flare is a new field upgrade, which is described as a massive energy beam that deals lethal shadow damage and penetrates everything in its path.</p><p dir="ltr">Augments are the upgradable tiers that players can unlock to improve the power of their perks, ammo mods, and even the field upgrades.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zombies_currencies">Zombies currencies</h3><p dir="ltr">Both Essence and salvage currencies return from Black Ops Cold War Zombies. Essence is essentially the points used to open doors and purchase items such as perks, weapons, and Pack-a-Punch upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">The Salvage currency are the junk piles scavenged from fallen enemies, but unlike Black Ops Cold War's salvage rarities, Black Ops 6 only uses one rarity type. This will be used to upgrade weapons to a higher rarity, as well as crafting of lethal, tactical, and support equipment.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Exfils_and_loadouts">Exfils and loadouts</h3><p dir="ltr">Taking more features from Black Ops Cold War, players will once again have the option to exfil from the map safely, or they can choose to play until they die in a more traditional manner.</p><p dir="ltr">Customized loadouts also return, so players can choose to start their match with weapon builds of their choice. Zombies-specific challenges and camos will also be available.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="New_Mutant_Injection_turns_players_into_Manglers">New Mutant Injection turns players into Manglers</h3><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to craft the support items from Black Ops Cold War, which includes the self-revive, RC car killstreak, and sentry turret. The game also introduces the new Mutant Injection support item.</p><p dir="ltr">Mutant Injection turns players into the Mangler special enemy type. Players grow an additional three feet taller, become clad in plated armor, use the Mangler's heavy attacks, utilize their sprint speed, and some other ability that's listed as "redacted."</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="GobbleGums_return">GobbleGums return</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347623-gobblegummachines.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347623-gobblegummachines.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347623"></a><figcaption>Redesigned Mr. Peeks GobbleGum machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347623-gobblegummachines.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">GobbleGums return from Black Ops 3. These are single-use items that offer a brief limited-time ability. Players can create a loadout for up to three GobbleGums per match, and additional GobbleGums can be earned in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">GobbleGums come in a variety of rarities: Rare, Epic, Legendary, Ultra, and Whimsical, with the general rule that the higher the rarity, the more powerful the effect of the GobbleGum--the exception being the Whimsical gums that only give a unique visual effect.</p><p dir="ltr">GobbleGums cannot be dropped or shared, but players can swap to a different pack at any time during a match by using the in-game menu. Any unused GobbleGums are kept between matches, and so players won't lose them even if they happen to disconnect from a match.</p><p dir="ltr">Notable returning gums include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Perkaholic - Gives the player all Perk-a-Colas in the map</li><li dir="ltr">Wall-to-Wall Clearance - Wall Buys cost only 10 Essence</li><li dir="ltr">Free Fire - Firing weapons consumes no ammo for the next 60 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Soda Fountain - The next perk purchased gives an additional random perk</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Call of Duty: Next event will also include live gameplay and news for multiplayer. Several Black Ops 6 leaks have surfaced ahead of the big event, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-leaks-reveal-a-controversial-warzone-map-with-caldera-2-0-vibes/1100-6525560/">potential new Warzone map filled with water</a>, and a new game mechanic that lets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-leaks-continue-this-time-with-a-graphic-new-ability/1100-6525547/">players use their enemies as meat shields</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnaroks-pc-systems-requirements-are-here-and-youll-need-to-free-up-190gb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
God of War Ragnarök is making the jump from PlayStation to PC on 19th September, and ahead of its arrival, Sony has shared PC system requirements - which, among other things, reveals players will need to free up 190GB of hard drive space to play.
</p>
<p>
As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the minimum hardware players will likely need to get Ragnarök running at 1080p with an average of 30fps at Low settings is a GTX 1060/RX 5500 XT, an Intel i5-4670K/Ryzen 3 1200, 8GB RAM, Windows 10, and the aforementioned 190GB SSD space.
</p>
<p>
Right at the other, considerably flashier end of the spectrum, it's recommended players hoping to hit an average of 60fps at 4K on Ultra settings have an RTX 4070 Ti/RX 7900 XT, an Intel i5-11600K/Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB RAM, Windows 10, and, yes, a big ol' chunk of SSD space.

<p>
Sony also notes Ragnarök will support Nvidia DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XeSS 1.3, as well as "frame generation for all technologies utilising that feature", on PC. Additionally, a PlayStation Network account - which Sony has been determined to foist on PC players since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">failed attempt with Helldivers 2</a> back in May - is required to play.
</p>
<p>
But is God of War Ragnarök worth jettisoning 190GB of meticulously digitised 16th century erotica for? Chris Tapsell called it "gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return">Recommended review</a>. "You will fight some big, ugly monsters," he wrote. "You'll stand silhouetted, jagged, cartoonishly angular in front of them. Finally, deep into this game, you will get a bit of the old Kratos back, a bit of PS2 excess will break free of its self-conscious cage."
</p>

But many players aren’t excited about any of that. Instead, they are hyped for the game’s Zombies mode, as the devs behind this entry, Treyarch, are the original studio behind Zombies in <em>Call of Duty</em> and a lot of folks were curious to see what the team has been working on. Turns out, it’s a lot of good stuff. </p><p>On August 8, after some teasing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treyarch offered a huge in-depth</a></span> look at its upcoming Zombies mode, including the new map “Terminus” as well as a host of new features and options. And a brand new trailer, too.</p><p>One of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1821564838277263844&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1821564838277263844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest new features</a></span> added to Treyarch’s round-based Zombies mode is the ability to take a break during solo runs and return to your game later. This will let players who might be getting tired or who need to eat something stop and save their progress, and come back to continue their run when they’re ready. </p><p>While some players worried that this would make it too easy to reach higher levels, others pointed out that it would still take a lot of skill, it’s just that now you can actually go to bed at 2 am instead of grinding away all night on a good run. </p><p>Another cool feature added to this year’s <em>CoD </em>Zombies mode is the ability for friends to jump into your co-op match while it’s in progress. Perhaps you’re playing with a friend but they have to leave, or their internet connection drops. Well, now you can invite another friend to hop in and help out without having to restart the run. (This is only available in co-op matches, so a solo player can’t hit round 100, take a break, and call in some friends to help later.) </p><p>Treyarch is also looking to get more people involved in completing main quests in this year’s Zombies mode. In the past, main quests have been really hard to pull off, often involving various steps that aren’t telegraphed or explained to the player. This time around, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest:~:text=While%20Treyarch%20is,new%20map%20launches.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Quest:~:text=While%20Treyarch%20is,new%20map%20launches." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treyarch is going to offer a “guided” option</a></span> so that casual or new players will be able to see what to do next to complete a map’s main quest. </p><p>But don’t worry, the guided mode won’t be available right away. Instead, Treyarch says they will be added later, so the community can still hunt for how to complete the main quests and all of a map’s secrets. </p><p>There’s a lot more to be learned from Treyarch’s impressively long blog post about its Zombies mode, including changes to weapon upgrades, equipment, economy tweaks, and much more. A lot of the stuff in the blog goes over my head as I’ve not played Zombies since <em>Black Ops 3</em>, but I’ll admit that I’m more excited to check out <em>BLOPS6</em>'s undead action thanks to some of these smart changes that will make the game a bit easier and more casual-friendly. </p><p><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> launches on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 25. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-day-one-1851503214">It arrives on Game Pass on day one</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An hour after leaving a screening of the new <em>Borderlands </em>movie, directed by Eli Roth (<em>Hostel)</em> and starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ariana Greenblatt, I’m staring at a blinking cursor in a blank Google Doc, urging inspiration to strike. </p><p>Surely a live-action movie based on the wildly successful edgelord video game franchise from 2K and Gearbox would inspire a couple hundred words, right? Surely the star-studded cast, which includes several Oscar winners (and Jack Black), would prompt a spark of creativity. Surely the vibrant visuals, cacophonous explosions, and poop and pee jokes would destroy the writer’s block dam, sending forth a surge of witty words and succinct sentences. But I’m at a loss.</p><p><em>Borderlands </em>is not just bad, it’s depressing.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h13085"><a id=""></a><strong>On the border of a breakdown</strong></h2><p>I saw <em>Borderlands</em> at an early screening at Alamo Drafthouse, during which cosplay was encouraged. No one wore costumes, and the theater was solemnly silent, as if we were about to watch archival video of the deadliest WWII battle or found footage from 9/11. R-rated trailers aired before it, prompting me to question if this movie, directed by Roth (known for his gory, gross violence), was rated R (it’s not).<br></p><p>Before I have a chance to double-check the rating, Cate Blanchett’s voice echoes through the theater. “Long ago, our galaxy was ruled by an alien race,” she intones, sounding bizarrely flat for an incredibly talented actor who endeavored to deliver a fun, frenetic performance in another superficial flick: 2017’s <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>. I’m immediately assaulted by aggressive, slap-dash cuts and shimmery CGI images of guns, neon signs, and Psychos, as Blanchett (who plays Lilith, a character who inspired early-twenties me so much I got one of her quotes tattooed) gives us the plot overview with as much energy as a ‘50s housewife who regularly mixes mood stabilizers and martinis.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-recommend-id="image://078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lilith, Tiny Tina, Claptrap, Krieg, and Roland sit in a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lilith, Tiny Tina, Claptrap, Krieg, and Roland sit in a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate / 2K</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-recommend-id="image://078977febfce0ed44d4951b119d8b604" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lilith, Tiny Tina, Claptrap, Krieg, and Roland sit in a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lilith tells us that the Eridians laid the foundation of this galaxy, then disappeared, leaving behind a secret vault hidden on the planet Pandora, inside of which are powerful relics of the long-lost civilization. “That sounds like some wacko B.S., huh?” Blanchett asks. I stifle a groan with a huge bite of my burger. Rather than giving moviegoers the free-wheeling wanderlust that the <em>Borderlands</em> games offer, the film is incredibly linear and straightforward: Lilith, a bounty hunter, is hired by the head of arms manufacturer Atlas Industries to track down his daughter Tiny Tina on the planet Pandora.<br></p><p>We’re introduced to almost all of the main cast rather quickly: Hart as Roland, Greenblatt as Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu as a Psycho named Kreig. Roland breaks Tiny Tina out of some kind of facility by way of a fairly bland action sequence, during which he punches a guard and calls him a “fake Stormtrooper-ass bitch.” I guess that means <em>Star Wars </em>exists in the <em>Borderlands </em>universe? It doesn’t improve after this.<br></p><p>If you told me <em>Borderlands </em>used AI for its dialogue, I’d believe you without question. Nearly every line that’s uttered with the kind of fake peppiness I’d reserve for my elementary school cheer competitions is either a limp-dicked “edgy” joke that wouldn’t warrant a single Reddit upvote or a cliche phrase like “I’m too old for this shit” and “This has been a <em>really</em> long day.” I could count on one hand the lines that were thoroughly genuine—or at least not dripping with so much snark they were almost sticky. There is no humanity here, just humorless humans.<br></p><p>When a needle-drop of Muse’s “Supermassive Black Hole” bleeds into a scene in which it’s playing over the speakers in a Pandoran bar, I nearly slam my head onto the table. What are we doing here?</p><figure id="" data-id="4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-recommend-id="image://4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tina, and Lilith look off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tina, and Lilith look off-camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate / 2K</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-recommend-id="image://4d491b942f4727b7b12ee16a71b2e243" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Roland, Tannis, Krieg, Tina, and Lilith look off-camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h13086"><a id=""></a><strong>We need to talk about Tina</strong></h2><p>Blissfully, <em>Borderlands</em> isn’t that long of a movie, and the breakneck speed at which the film is paced means we meet Jamie Lee Curtis’ Tannis just before I need a pee break (I chugged a beer). Curtis plays her with a socially awkward twitchiness that I didn’t expect from the actor, and while it’s at least an attempt at imbuing the character with a personality, it is incredibly grating. But again, she tried—Blanchett is phoning it in, Hart has no business playing the straight man, and Greenblatt is doing the best she can with material that’s based on a white character doing a blaccent (which the film, thankfully, avoids). But even she can’t save a line read that requires her to say “badonkadonk” in the year of our lord 2024.<br></p><p>And also, not to be ageist, but why the fuck is everyone so <em>old</em>? Lilith is 22 years old in the original <em>Borderlands</em> game and Tannis is in her thirties—aside from the star power afforded by casting Blanchett and Curtis, the only reason for aging up these characters is so they can play matronly figures to Greenblatt’s Tina.<br></p><p>And therein lies the main problem: centering Tina. The plot revolves around her believing she is the child of Eridia and the key to opening the vault, and the film hinges all of the emotional weight on a character who wears a bunny-ear headband and throws explosive teddy bears at people while spewing one-liners like a sugar-crazed 11-year-old in a <em>Fortnite </em>lobby. She does not inspire any sort of empathy, even with Greenblatt’s valiant efforts and Blanchett’s only <em>real</em> acting taking place in their scenes together. It’s like making a <em>Gears of War </em>movie with a Carmine brother at the center—it’s going to be annoying from the jump.<br></p><p>All of this takes place in a weird CGI world that occasionally looks decent but is more often an illegible green-screen mess of explosions or muddy, dark, murky nonsense. Lilith’s flame-orange hair and comic book costume set against a dusty, bland landscape and broken-down industrial buildings is visually and tonally jarring—it’s like the filmmakers got halfway to making a movie inspired by the cel-shaded world of <em>Borderlands</em> and then dumped it all onto the sets used for the <em>Halo</em> series. Speaking of costumes, I’d love to know what the budget was for push-up bras. Tannis, Mad Moxxi, and Lilith all have their breasts pushed up so high they’re nearly in their throats—it is so desperately 2006, so reminiscent of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, that I couldn’t help but giggle. Boobs, am I right?<br></p><p>By the time the film ends and Jack Black’s Claptrap pops up on screen during the credits to lament the loss of his Easter egg, I am ready to go home and cleanse my palate. I need some proper aughts trashiness, some expensive needle drops, and some questionable costumes. I get home, plop down on the couch, and turn on <em>Gossip Girl</em>. At least this has personality.</p><hr><p>The <em>Borderlands</em> movie isn’t so good it’s surprising, and it’s not so bad it’s worth a hate-watch. It is simply sad. It feels like the result of a bunch of suits who sat around a glossy mahogany table (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01l_jMhjVM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01l_jMhjVM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like in that one <em>Key and Peele</em> sketch</a></span>) and reminisced about the early aughts, a time before the financial crisis, a time when the term “cancel” was reserved only for television shows, a time when Muse was one of the biggest rock bands on the planet.<br></p><p>It is devoid of humanity and personality, despite trying very, very hard to establish that it is quirky. It is the woman with frozen peas on her head in the grocery store aisle—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shes-so-crazzzzzzzy-love-her&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/shes-so-crazzzzzzzy-love-her" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she’s so <em>crazzzzzyy</em>, love her</a></span>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-op-6-zombies-details-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Call of Duty’s latest blog post provides a barrage of Intel for the Black Ops 6 Zombies game mode. The upcoming title will feature the return round-based Zombie action, and the maps available at launch include Terminus and Liberty Falls.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-round-based-gameplay">Round Based Gameplay</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies aims to provide the “most rewarding Round-Based experience Treyarch has ever made.” The round-based zombie maps will require players and their teammates to escape from a maximum-security prison surrounded by hordes of the Undead. The prison is situated on Terminus Island, and players will manage two main currencies in this mode: Essence and Salvage.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-essence-and-salvage">Essence and Salvage</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6’ round-based Zombies game mode will include additional routes which allow players to access previously blocked areas by unlocking doors or moving obstacles. To access these new paths, players will have to spend their Essence. To earn Essence, players will need to slay Zombies or find them in Dark Aether vials. Players can use Essence to purchase Perks, Ammo, Tactical Raft, upgrade armour and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Salvage, on the other hand, has to be acquired by rummaging through piles of junk that are highlighted by green outlines. Players can then use Salvage to access Ammo Mods, upgrade Rarity Tiers, and buy specific Tactical, Lethal and Support equipment through the Crafting Table.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-main-quests">Black Ops 6 Zombies Main Quests</h2>



<p>Players will find a main quest on each Black Ops 6 Zombies Map. These quests allow players to explore the area and investigate their surroundings. Their investigations could sometimes lead to nothing and, at times, to an audio log, document, or strange artefact. Additionally, players will find a bunch of Easter Eggs as they dive deeper into their investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Additionally, Black Ops 6 Zombies is receiving an all-new guided mode, which allows newer players to get a handle on things. The guidance mode will have round caps to maintain progression, and all side quests and Easter Eggs will be disabled to prioritise the narrative. The devs will release this game mode later in the season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of their investigation, players will have the option to exfiltrate from the Zombies Map by calling in the Raptor One at the landing sight and coming back with better intel about the location. For the first time, players will be able to save and Quit in a solo match. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>About to hit your personal high-round record? Need to get some sleep?</p><p>For the first time ever in Zombies, you can Save &amp; Quit in a Solo match. Even if you disconnect, simply pick up where you left off. <a href="https://t.co/lZNhbn3ysM">pic.twitter.com/lZNhbn3ysM</a></p></div>— Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1821564838277263844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombimovement">Black Ops 6 Zombimovement</h2>



<p>Players will also receive a 360-degree range of motion in Zombies mode. Through Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement feature, players can sprint, slide and dive in any direction. Omnimovement will introduce a new range of manoeuvres that weren’t available before, allowing you to get out of situations more strategically when things are getting sticky. Moreover, players can switch from first person to third person perspective for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Nintendo and Capcom are both officially at PAX WEST, a convention from August 30 through September 2 for the Labor Day weekend. PAX WEST takes place at the Seattle Convention Center, for those who want to attend.</p>
<p>Not only has Nintendo been officially confirmed for PAX WEST, but Capcom will be celebrating PAX's 20th birthday with the first North American hands-on demo for Monster Hunter Wilds. In addition to a hands-on demo of Monster Hunter Wilds, fans will also get to participate in a hands-on demo of the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, as well as the first North American hands-on for Street Fighter 6's new character, Terry Bogard.</p>
<p>In addition to Capcom's hands-on demos, avid Street Fighter 6 fans will be able to participate in a tournament in the PAX Arena.</p>
<p>PAX has seen many huge announcements throughout the years, with PAX EAST <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-dlc-2-the-rising-tide-to-be-unveiled-at-pax-east-panel/">showcasing the second DLC for Final Fantasy XVI.</a> There is the potential for some really big announcements at PAX WEST.</p>
<p>PAX WEST has a packed line-up of exhibitors, with Nintendo being the latest to join the crowd. Studios such as Larian Studios, Capcom, Atari, and Bandai Namco are some of the biggest to join the exhibitors, with smaller indie studios such as Aggro Crab Games, Finji, and Serenity Forge also showcasing their talents in the exhibitor's hall.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://west.paxsite.com/en-us/schedule.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official schedule for PAX WEST</a> has been uploaded to the website, revealing what attendees can expect throughout their days at the convention. This includes events such as learning how to play Dungeons and Dragons, Crash Bandicoot 4 speedruns, plenty of tabletop events, and the ability to get autographs and photos with well-known voice actors.</p>
<p>At the moment, we don't know what games Nintendo plans to showcase at PAX WEST, but it is possible that attendees will see more of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. The Nintendo World Championships event will also take place at 8 PM on the first day of the convention.</p>
<p>In addition to in-person events, there will also be plenty of live streams over the PAX Twitch channels, where people can catch special announcements, panels, and any of the PAX Arena tournaments. There are four channels for PAX, giving people who aren't attending plenty of information despite not being able to attend in person.</p>
<p>The full weekend ticket is $250, with day tickets at $66. However, tickets are running out. So, if you want to go to PAX WEST and see what Nintendo plans to showcase at the convention, make sure to snap up a ticket while you still can.</p>

Hidden in an out-of-bounds spot on the map is a heartfelt and emotional dedication to fans that you won’t want to miss—and you’ll be rewarded with some cool gear in the process. Here’s everything you need to know about finding the secret area in <em>Cat Quest III</em>.</p><h2 id="h13434"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find the secret area and obtain The Gentlebros gear</strong></h2><p>You can access the out-of-bounds secret area at any point in <em>Cat Quest III</em>, including the very beginning of the game. To do so, simply head to the very bottom left of the map and skim the boundary until you reach the number 4. Here, you should see a tiny gap left over in the boundary, which will allow your ship to pass through.</p><figure id="" data-id="b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-recommend-id="image://b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The gap in the map to the secret location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The gap in the map to the secret location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-recommend-id="image://b4ee8762ae618a2487ea1e32824136dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The gap in the map to the secret location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After passing through the gap in the boundary, follow the white trail in the water for a while until you reach a group of Gentlebros hanging out in the water. They’d like to share a speech with you, but they’ve lost the papers it’s written on. As such, they’ll request that you find the three pieces of paper.<br></p><p>The first piece of paper is just to the left of the group, while the second is directly above them. Finding the third and final piece, however, will require you to ride your ship west just out of sight of The Gentlebros.</p><p>When you’ve found all three pieces of paper, Gentlebro Desmond (named after The Gentlebros CEO, Desmond Wong) will share an emotional speech filled with appreciation from the team for both the time they’ve been granted to work on the series, as well as the support of their loving fanbase.</p><p>But a heartwarming speech isn’t all you’ll receive for finding this secret area. Right before leaving, The Gentlebros will give you two pieces of Gentlebros gear to wear (snazzy!). And as a final reward, Gentlebro Desmond will return and leave a chest behind. Inside, you’ll find The Architect, a strong, ranged weapon with unlimited ammo. Pawsome!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-zombies-preview.948315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-zombies-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>First things first: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Zombies is a return to the fan favorite round-based co-op mode of 1-4 players surviving wave after wave of zombies that escalates in challenge and difficulty each round. The story picks up after the events of 2020’s Black Ops Cold War and continues the Dark Aether storyline with a cast featuring the returning Weaver, Grey, and Carver – who have been imprisoned – along with the new character of Maya as playable in Zombies. Each has their own storylines. Also returning is former villain William Peck, who acts as your guide, along with Oskar Strauss and Raptor One in support roles. What I can say is that I enjoyed my time playing Zombies. Treyarch seems to have established a strong balance of community requested features, level design, and progression that is shaping up to satisfy veterans and newcomers to the franchise.</p><p>Zombies will feature two maps at launch: Liberty Falls, set in West Virginia, and Terminus, an island set in the Philippine Sea. Terminus was playable during my hands-on time, and developer Treyarch is calling this one the biggest maps they have ever made: it’s filled with side missions, random dynamic encounters, environmental traps, and plenty of experiences left to discover and explore as you battle the zombie horde. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Treyarch’s motto for Terminus is “anywhere you can see, you can go.” The map will also introduce new enemies like the Vermin and Parasites that, once the main host is killed, will mutate and evolve into a more deadly foe. Players will have access to a drivable vehicle with the Project Janus Tactical Raft that we used during our play session to explore a smaller island that was visible from the main coastline. </p><p>Black Ops 6 Zombies will also see the return of Global Progression, Classic Prestige, Weapon Customization, map-specific intel systems, and fan favorite GobbleGums, a single-use item which you can store up to three GobbleGums at a time that provides in-game effects and abilities.</p><p>Wonder Weapons also make a return, with the all-new BeamSmasher that uses sound frequency and light energy types for unique and spectacular damage results. Elemental damage types also have effects and abilities against enemies weak to that damage type, with a fun example being making an enemy teleport and reappear high in the air and fall at a high rate of speed. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, the Augment Upgrade System brings a customized experience by allowing players to unlock three major and three minor upgrades per each item for every perk, field upgrade, and ammo mod. You will be able to equip one major and minor upgrade at a time. Augments are permanent upgrades that you earn by simply playing Zombies and you’ll have the ability to focus your progression towards a specific augment of the hundred augments that will be available at launch by utilizing the Research feature available via create a class. Melee Macchiato Perk was a favorite during my playtime, and it provides a strong punch attack in close combat and Support Injection that for a limited time transforms you into a force of nature smashing through hordes of Zombies with ease.</p><p>Also available in create a class are Zombie Builds, which allows you to save your custom weapon builds and make them available in game via the mystery box. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A few other new quality-of-life features are coming to Black Ops 6 too: “Save and Quit”, Third-Person mode, and Guided Mode. Save and Quit is a new feature that provides a limited pause in solo games and for longer breaks, you can save your status and resume – but only one save slot will be available to prevent multiple checkpoints as you chase those higher rounds. For co-op games, Treyarch is adding a “join matches at any time” feature for drop in/drop out flexibility to allow friends to join games in progress and/or after a disconnect from a session. Third-Person mode is available for the first time in a Black Ops game and can be toggled on/off at any time. HUD options that allow you to remove health bars and damage numbers will be available, plus preset options with choices such as: standard, legacy, mini map and a streamer mode which would allow room for a face cam or overlay.</p><p>But the feature I am most excited to see for players new to Zombies is Guided Mode. I sat down with the development team at Treyarch to discuss Guided Mode and was surprised to hear that a very low percentage of players finish the main quest, so the team decided to implement a guided version that removes side missions and the round-based ticking clock in order to provide a more welcoming and curated experience. It’s all in an effort to get more people to try and complete the main story. Guided mode will not be available at launch, though, and for hardcore players there will be an incentive to complete the main quest before the new mode launches in the form of a calling card.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After 45 minutes of hands-on time with Black Ops 6, I thoroughly enjoyed fighting my way through the Zombie horde on the island of Terminus. The map is, as Treyarch promised, huge with plenty to discover. In my limited time, using my pre-configured loadout and using the Mystery Box I was able to try out a variety of weapons including shotguns, SMGs and assault rifles. As always, all the weapons had their advantages and disadvantages, but overall they felt good to use – as did augment upgrades to various perks and field equipment such as scatter mines and the enhanced melee abilities when surrounded in close combat scenarios. The difficulty does ramp up and as you progress, I noticed I was being downed frequently by mobs of enemies surrounding me as we advanced into higher rounds (mutated parasites will be a problem if not taken down quickly) and I really needed to start using more strategy and communication with teammates versus simply running and gunning – as I expect most new players will be inclined to do on initial play sessions. </p><p>There are A LOT of features being packed into Zombies this year – from exploring the island of Terminus, utilizing the GobbleGums, taking advantage of the Augment upgrades, customizing my weapons in Zombie builds, to using the Wonder Weapons to take down hordes of enemies. And this doesn’t even include things I haven’t mentioned yet, like Global Onimovement or the second map of Liberty Falls, which Treyarch promises to share more about in the coming weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Black Ops 6 Zombies is shaping up to be one of the most fully fleshed out examples of the mode that Treyarch first introduced in Call of Duty: World at War 16 years ago, and I’m genuinely looking forward to playing more of it when Black Ops 6 drops this Fall. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"It's fast-paced, like the movement and adding that slide mechanic sort of makes a world of difference when it comes to being able to run and gun," Kassa said of the game's movement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Splitgate 2 gameplay trailer also clears up some of the confusion regarding the game's factions, a new gameplay feature that was absent from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate/">original Splitgate</a>. Splitgate 2 will feature three factions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aeros: This is the class for the movement-lovers. Players who join this faction gain increased agility, with quicker reloads and faster sprinting.</li><li dir="ltr">Meridian: The Meridian faction is effectively a support class, giving players who join it the ability to heal themselves and their allies. Members of the Meridian faction can also use a scan function to see enemies through walls.</li><li dir="ltr">Sabrask: This faction is more focused on defense, and is ideal for players who are either new to using portals, or simply don't wish to focus their gameplay around them. While not as mobile as the other factions, players who choose to join Sabrask will gain access to helpful defensive tools like a damage-blocking wall and sticky grenades.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The four-minute trailer marks the first time players have gotten an extended look at Splitgate 2's gameplay. Although the game doesn't yet have an official release date, 1047 Games has confirmed that Splitgate 2 will launch on console and PC sometime in 2025. But players still have plenty to do while they wait for the game to go live--1047 has <a href="https://onelink.to/sg2faction" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a quiz</a> to help players decide which faction best suits their playstyle, and is hosting a livestream later this month to give players another look at how the game plays. Portal fanatics can catch the stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Splitgate" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splitgate 2's Twitch</a> channel on Wednesday, August 14 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intel%E2%80%99s-bios-updates-for-crashing-cpus-are-now-rolling-out.948288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216054/intel-msi-asus-bios-updates-crashing-13th-14th-raptor-lake-gen-cpus<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus and MSI have both released beta BIOS updates today to address Intel’s crashing 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake desktop processors. While the BIOS updates won’t fix CPUs that are already damaged, they include Intel’s new microcode update that should help further address the instability issues.</p><p>If it works well, this could be a very big deal for Intel, which lost some of its reputation after its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">flagship chips were found to crash</a> earlier this year and, after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178751/intel-raptor-lake-crash-fix-etvb-not-yet">long investigation</a>, discovered there would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a">no true fix</a>, requiring customers to replace any damaged chips. Intel also isn’t having a great year, period, recently announcing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs">layoffs of at least 15,000 workers</a> and stopping “non-essential work.”</p><p>Asus has <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/intel-700-600-series/raptorlake-resources/m-p/1034564/highlight/true#M24284">released its beta BIOS updates</a> through its ROG forums for a variety of Z790 motherboards. These are also typically posted to Asus’ support pages a few days after they’re posted to its ROG forums. MSI’s BIOS updates can be found on the individual motherboard support pages for its motherboards:</p><p>While we wouldn’t normally recommend using a beta BIOS update, given that this addresses an “elevated operating voltages” issue, you might want to go ahead and install these as soon as possible.</p><p>If you use a board other than MSI and Asus, or the microcode BIOS update isn’t available for your particular motherboard right now, make sure you’re on the latest BIOS update either way. Even if they’re missing the latest fix, recent BIOS updates should already include Intel’s recommended power delivery profiles, which could reduce the likelihood of your chip getting damaged.</p><p>“Please help us get the word out to all Raptor Lake desktop users, especially i9 users, in big screaming headlines that they need to update their PC to the latest BIOS now to stop/prevent the CPU wear and hopefully avoid the need for an RMA,” said Falcon Northwest founder Kelt Reeves in an email to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this week.</p><p>If you have an Asus board and want to check that your BIOS is set to the right power profile, Falcon Northwest has a good overview we’ve embedded below. The very latest Asus BIOS updates should already default to Intel’s settings instead of the company’s own overclocking profile.</p><p>Intel reportedly said these BIOS updates <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-says-raptor-lake-microcode-update-will-not-affect-overclocking-and-performance-new-arrow-lake-battlemage-updates">shouldn’t cause</a> any performance loss, and reviewers are already gearing up to test Intel’s latest microcode to ensure there are no big changes for its 13th and 14th Gen chips.</p><p>We’re also still waiting on Intel to provide a tool to test existing machines for any processor degradation. Intel has also extended its warranty on a variety of 13th and 14th Gen CPUs by an additional two years. PC makers are largely passing on that warranty extension to consumers, and you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus">find out if your own system is covered right here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Applicants must have a playable prototype and should ideally be an "early-career or under-the-radar developer" who is part of an underrepresented group within the games industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These grants are intended to support creators who are under-invested-in within today’s game industry or who do not receive much support from the existing structures," explains the Draknek website. There are no geographical restrictions to applicants.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Draknek defines a puzzle game as any title that is "primarily about thinking/logical reasoning–and not primarily challenging due to execution/timing elements."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Puzzle games cover a wide range of subgenres, e.g. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Patrick's Parabox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ElecHead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Return of the Obra Dinn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Opus Magnum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are five games with very different gameplay, which would all be considered relevant," it adds. "However, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a phenomenal game, it is not an example of what we're looking for due to its reliance on reaction speed. If in doubt, please apply."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers who have already secured the backing of a publisher or are fully funded might not meet eligibility requirements, but those who have so far only received a microgrant or incubator support will likely clear that bar. The studio will hand out six grants and explained the money can be spent on "anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From development tools to rent, the grant money is intended to help people interested in creating puzzle games in whatever way makes sense for the individual," it added. The grant will also provide mentorship opportunities, but won't burden recipients with specific deadlines or milestones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want you to feel involved in the cohort and the community, and you’ll be invited to present your progress at the end of the year. The key is your satisfaction and growth, not rigid timelines or predefined goals," added Draknek.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you don't finish your game by the end of the grant period, it’s not a problem. We understand that creative projects can take unexpected turns. We don’t want you to feel pressured to continue with something that no longer inspires you or makes sense for your development."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://grants.draknek.org/">Click here to learn more about the Draknek New Voices Puzzle Grant, including how to apply</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <p>
Vampire Survivors - the acclaimed (and still doggedly vampire-free) minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle - is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 29th August.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors launched into PC early access back in 2021, where it immediately set tongues wagging - partly because it cost an absurdly generous £3.99, but mostly because its mix of wave-based monster dodging and auto-bludgeoning is very blimmin' good indeed.
</p>
<p>
"Once this wave is done, once this boss is done, once I've unlocked a new character or item, I should really turn off the computer and go for a run. Maybe," wrote Christian Donlan in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Recommended review</a>. "Or maybe one more go, one more choice, one more chance to confuse speed with damage with experience."

<p>
Since its early access debut, Vampire Survivors has received a 1.0 release, a heap of free and paid DLC (including collaborations with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-announces-among-us-dlc-collaboration">Among Us</a> and Contra), and it's spread its leathery wings to Xbox, Switch, Android, iOS, and Mac. Oh, and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">won a BAFTA</a>. So while PlayStation is definitely a little late to the party, it remains, at least, a party worth attending.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors' PlayStation release will include all free content released so far - adding up to over 40 playable characters and 80 weapons – and all four of its paid DLCs (Legacy of Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meetings, and Operation Guns) will be available for purchase on PS5 and PS4 at launch.
</p>
<p>
Expect Vampire Survivors to cost £3.99/€4.99/$4.99 when it <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010458/">comes to PS4 and PS5</a> on 29th August, with its paid DLC priced at £1.59/€1.99/$1.99.

			<p>Enshrouded first went into Early Access in January 2024, and since then, it has been incredibly successful. Developed and published by Keen Games GmbH, this is the second game they created, with Portal Knights being their first. Since its release in January, it has reached over 30 million players, and the number is continuing to rise.</p>
<p><a href="https://enshrouded.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enshrouded</a> is a game worth the price tag, as there is much content for an Early Access game. There have been three major updates, all of which have added new features. In addition, it has seen 14 patches and 16 hotfixes, with the developers consistently working to ensure the game remains in its best possible state for players to get stuck into.</p>
<p>Considering the game has only been out since January, there is much content and fixes for players to explore. They are not even close to done with the planned content, as they have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-2024-early-access-roadmap-full-release-2025/">full roadmap</a> ahead of them. While most of their planned content is for 2025 and beyond, 2024 has already seen some major updates.</p>
<p>These updates include the instanced dungeons called the Hallowed Halls, which players can take on alone or in a group. Later this year, they will be adding Water to the game. While there is already Water you can drink, there is no form of flowing water or bodies of water to be found. Instead, it is just lava.</p>
<p>Upcoming updates include World Events and the ability to visit other players' bases. Looking ahead to 2024, Enshrouded has planned updates, such as a Weather System, new enemies and bosses, and enemy patrols.</p>
<p>Since its release in January, over 90 million hours of Enshrouded has been played, with nearly 150 million player deaths. Additionally, almost 700,000 players have reached the maximum level of level 25.</p>
<p>With Enshrouded's release in January, Keen Games GmbH has doubled in size. The longest-serving member of the team has worked there for 19 years, and the latest member joined in August to help bolster the QA.</p>
<p>This company takes its players' feedback seriously, with players able to suggest new items or events on the Enshrouded Feature Board. This has helped the company choose what to put on its roadmap, and some of the most voted-for features, such as the Hallowed Halls, have already made it into the game.</p>
<p>Keen Games GmbH hopes to have a full release of Enshrouded on PC in 2025, with the game also coming to consoles that year. So far, Enshrouded maintains a Very Positive overall review on Steam, and is continuing to rise in popularity.</p>
