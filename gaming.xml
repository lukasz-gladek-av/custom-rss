            <p>"Something big is going on behind the scenes" at Starfield.</p>
<p>That's according to players who have been poking around in Steam's backend. By monitoring the updates made to the Steam files via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/">SteamDB</a>, some players claim that Bethesda has made more changes in May than March and April combined.</p>

<p>"It's pointless trying to decipher the changelogs on Steamdb, but one thing is certain from experience: when there are a lot of changes, something big is coming," opined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1d5uzkz/something_big_is_going_on_behind_the_scenes_there/">u/JarusinTheStars</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/starfield-update-patch-dlc-coming-soon-rumour/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"And over the past week (and more generally since May 1st), there have been more changes than ever since launch, sometimes more than 10 per day. For example, there were around 50-60 changes between the February and March updates. And around 100 between the March and May updates.</p>
<p>We've almost surpassed that figure in less than a month."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1d5uzkz/something_big_is_going_on_behind_the_scenes_there/">Something big is going on behind the scenes: there are more changelog changes than ever before since launch.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JarusinTheStars/">u/JarusinTheStars</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/">Starfield</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Consequently, this player believes that on the day of the Xbox Showcase – 9th June – Bethesda will present the Shattered Space expansion as well as the June update, and they reckon it'll be "even bigger than the last one".</p>
<p>Whilst there's no doubt that the Reddit user is right about the number and frequency of recent SteamDB updates, the rest is – naturally – only conjecture at this point. Thankfully, we don't have to wait too long for an update that proves JarusinTheStars' theory either way; the Xbox Showcase is just next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-may-patch-adds-60fps-target-for-series-x-land-vehicles-footage-also-teased">Starfield's May update</a> - yes, the one that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-shattered-space-expansion-out-in-autumn-city-map-stuff-due-soon">teased by Bethesa's Todd Howard</a> - is now live, bringing with it the previously promised surface map overhaul, alongside a new 60fps target mode on Xbox Series X. Additionally, Bethesda has shared a brief look at land vehicles, coming to Starfield in a future update.</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, Todd Howard, played down the absence of land vehicles prior to Starfield's launch, insisting it was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-lack-of-ground-vehicles-is-a-deliberate-choice-bethesda-says">deliberate design decision</a> that allowed the studio to "make it an experience where we know how fast [players are] seeing things." But last December, Bethesda teased that "new ways of travelling" were on Starfield's Horizon.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot</a> will feature over 150 PlayStation-inspired cameos.</p>
<p>That's according to the game's recently unveiled store <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/">listing</a>, which says we'll get to "rescue over 150 iconic VIP Bots inspired by legendary characters from 30 years of PlayStation history".</p>

<figcaption>Astro Bot's debut trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHMNQzLG_Jg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The same listing describes Astro Bot as a "standalone, full-sized adventure that offers over four times more worlds, 300 bots to rescue, and dozens of new powers and features to discover". It also confirms that Astro Bot is strictly a single-player experience that will only be available on PS5.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it also makes it very clear that Astro Bot does not include microtransactions, assuring players that there are "plenty of coins" to collect and spend in the Gatcha Lab.</p>
<p>Sony announced the new Astro Bot game during this week's PlayStation State of Play. It's simply called Astro Bot, is once again developed by Sony's Team Asobi, and launches for PlayStation 5 on 6th September. It's Astro's first starring role since 2020's PS5 launch title Astro's Playroom.</p>
<p>"[The] announcement of Astro Bot was so bittersweet for me," wrote Eurogamer's Ian in his fabulous feature, I<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">t's hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2 if even Astro Bot won't wear one</a>.</p>
<p>"Like everyone, I'm pumped for a new Astro Bot game, they're such joyful, heart-warming and uplifting games - and on top of that this new one looks a bit like a StarFox x Mario Mash-up. 'How can that not be a Game of the Year contender?!' I thought, as I watched the reveal. But then, as the trailer passed the one minute mark without showing footage of anything that looked like VR gameplay, my heart started to sink. That sunken heart then broke completely in two when, at the very end of the trailer, big bold words saying "COMING TO PS5" appeared. So no PSVR2 support at all?! For a character that technically only became big thanks to Astro Bot Rescue Mission on PSVR1? What gives?"</p>

Its storage upgrade features a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD and it maintains a microSD slot if that’s not enough for you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168870/nvidia-sff-ready-enthusiast-geforce-card<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia just gave the PC gaming industry a reason to shrink its biggest graphics cards and produce smallish cases. It’s not what I expected, but I think it might actually help. Read before you judge, friends — I was definitely ready to call out some Nvidia BS, but I’ve mostly come around.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141884/nvidia-will-greenlight-gpus-for-tiny-sff-gaming-pcs">When leakers revealed last month</a> that Nvidia would help steer its graphics card partners toward smaller gaming PCs, I began to daydream. Might we finally see a genuinely small Nvidia powerhouse like <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/9621/the-amd-radeon-r9-nano-review">AMD’s old R9 Nano</a>? Could Nvidia at least convince partners to produce two-slot GPUs like many of its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24039832/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">Founders Edition cards</a>? </p><p>Unfortunately, no. Nvidia’s just-announced “SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards” aren’t actually that small — even a 2.5 slot thick, 304mm long, and 151mm wide RTX 4070 can qualify. That means supposedly “SFF” GPUs will not fit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725010/ncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued">into my SFF case</a>, and I have a hard time calling these “SFF” at all. </p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s optional guidelines specify these maximum dimensions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This still looks like a pretty large case to me.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But if you, like me, want to help smaller gaming PCs get a larger foothold, this could<em> </em>help —  because it’s not just about the cards; it’s about knowing you can fit a certain amount of graphics horsepower in a given case because both the case and the card identify themselves as compatible with one another.</p><p>“I’m giving them a guideline to say, hey, leave this much space, and then you’ll be able to fit an enthusiast graphics card in there like a 4080, a 4070. That’s the purpose of this program,” Nvidia senior desktop products director Justin Walker tells me. </p><p>Indeed, the list of cards that Nvidia is sharing today only includes RTX 4070 or higher: it’s not promoting a fat 4060, for example.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a list of validated cards and cases so far. It’s not exhaustive, but these partners are on board.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Today, figuring out if a given card will fit is often a matter of painstakingly trolling manufacturer websites for length, width, and height <em>twice</em>: once for the card and once for the case. Now, you might just be able to look for “SFF-Ready” and move on with your day. You may still have to hit up those manufacturer websites, though, as Walker says there’s not necessarily going to be a Newegg sort filter for “SFF Ready” or a badge on the actual product yet.</p><p>He tells me these guidelines should reduce uncertainty for case manufacturers, too: “I’m making a small case, and I want it to fit a high end graphics card... right now I have no idea, there’s so many sizes and shapes. Right now I don’t know how to make a case that fits everything.” Now, there’s a target.</p><p>While I personally still wish Nvidia had tried harder to shrink the sizes of partner cards themselves — again, their own Founders Edition cards are generally just two slots thick! — there is some hope for more such GPUs. Walker says it’s no mistake that there’s only a single RTX 4080 on the SFF-Ready list, and he hopes more partners will rise to the challenge.</p><p>“It takes a lot of work and a very intentional design to put a 4080 in this form factor,” he says. “I get that it’s not a tiny Mini-ITX thing, but I want to let someone be able to put a 4080 into that case.”</p><p>Speaking of which: just a few days ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1795710634820268111">hardware leaker kopite7kimi attested</a> that Nvidia’s RTX 5090 Founders Edition card will have a dual-slot cooler.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest is upon us, taking its rightful place as the de facto summer video game experience after the shuttering of E3 last year. </p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">As is also tradition, Keighley has released his annual “Geoff’s Trailer,” a hype real spliced together of the biggest and best announcements that fans can expect at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/summer-game-fest-2024-exact-date-time-and-how-to-stream-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Summer Game Fest 2024: Geoff's Trailer (Watch Live Show This Friday in 4K!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZ2Clscn0Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There’s not necessarily any surprises in the trailer, but it does do a good job of setting the tone fans can expect from the show. There is, of course, a <em>lot</em> of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> in here, which makes sense. The DLC is imminent, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/elden-ring/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>‘s premiere was at Keighley’s Game Awards broadcast, so it should have a big showing here. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">There are other, similarily big games featured, too, hinting we may see more over the next week. The trailer features glimpses of the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-window-trailer-and-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a></em> and what looks to be the next Batman game, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/first-new-batman-arkham-in-years-is-a-meta-exclusive-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta-exclusive </a><em><a href="batman: Arkham Shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Summer Game Fest will air live on various platforms, including YouTube and Twitch, on Friday, June 7, at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT. The show will be a live production with trailers, reveals, and news of the biggest games from a plethora of devs. </p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In addition to the main SGF show, there are a number of highly anticipated ancillary programs over the surrounding days, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/devolver-direct-2024-when-and-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devolver Direct</a> and the much-hyped <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase + Call of Duty Direct</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">There will also be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some kind of Nintendo Direct</a> soon, though details remain scarce. Though Nintendo is unaffiliated with Summer Game Fest, they do tend to schedule their presentations around the same weekend, so it may be sooner rather than later. </p>

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A leak from a reasonably reliable source seems to hint that the Rabbids, Rayman’s iconic lagomorphic foils, could soon appear as a joinable faction in XDefiant. Where’s the limbless wonder when you need him?</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">The leak comes to us courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/AgainTx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1795831710501982657%7Ctwgr%5Ec7ac00410ff2e9aac1f0a2285667ae623b3ae30f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwin.gg%2Fnews%2Fnew-xdefiant-factions-leak-shows-assassins-creed-rabbids-r6-sige%2F">AgainTx</a>, a data miner who has provided credible information about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/second-xdefiant-double-weapon-xp-event-weekend/">weapons, abilities, and features</a> that made their way into XDefiant after the game’s initial launch. According to AgainTx, the Rabbids are just one of several new factions that will debut in XDefiant’s second year. Many of these factions are <a href="https://www.vg247.com/xdefiant-leaks-future-factions-might-include-assassins-creed-rabbids">based on Ubisoft games that have not yet received any representation</a> in XDefiant, including Assassins Creed, Rainbow Six, and The Crew.</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, many of AgainTx’s posts regarding this potential leak have been taken down to do copywrite strikes made against them by Ubisoft. While this means I can’t technically back up AgainTx’s claims, the fact that Ubisoft is going out of its way to censor their content does lend an air of credibility to them and their work.</p> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="942" data-injectable="true">If this leak turns out to be accurate, I’m amazed it’s taken this long for the Rabbids to appear in XDefiant. The Rabbids have come a long way since their debut in Rayman: Raving Rabbids back on the Wii, to the point where they’ve effectively become the unofficial Ubisoft mascots. While I’m not afraid to admit that I feel the Rabbids’ whole “so-random” schtick is a little played out, I’d be lying If I said I’m not excited by the sheer madness they could introduce into the straight-laced world of a first-person shooter like XDefiant.</p>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Of course, this is still all speculation, and there is a real possibility that AgainTx will be proven wrong once XDefiant’s second year starts. Only time will tell, but it seems like this leak could be a fun, or at least funny, one if it turns out to be true.</p>

  <p id="t2gXIF">George Miller’s <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164264/furiosa-best-prequels-george-miller-mad-max-franchise">complements and enhances</a> the impact of his 2015 blockbuster <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em> </em>in a lot of ways, but there’s only one I can’t stop thinking about: How little the new movie has to say about Immortan Joe, the original movie’s iconic arch-villain. </p>
<p id="erCsDA">Sure, Joe’s lack of interaction with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162575/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa-souvenir-prop-prosthetic-arm-chris-hemsworth">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>’s Furiosa could be simply because Hugh Keays-Byrne, the actor who first put Immortan Joe on the screen, died in 2020. Lachy Hulme assumes the role for <em>Furiosa</em>, but perhaps George Miller reduced it out of respect for Keays-Byrne, who he worked with for many years.</p>
<p id="dQcJNm">But I’m skeptical. Joe’s consistent secondary status in Furiosa’s origin story fits the overall themes of <em>Furiosa</em> too well to be a coincidence: Immortan Joe, the demon of Imperator Furiosa’s last stand, wasn’t her nemesis at all. In fact, he wasn’t her <em>anything</em>. </p>

<p id="E3pDWM">This is in great contrast to <em>Fury Road</em>, where their beef seems <em>deeply personal</em>. Max Rockatansky wanders into somebody else’s narrative in <em>Fury Road</em>, as his stories usually go. This time, those somebodies are Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Immortan Joe. </p>
<p id="pBZqpR">While <em>Fury Road</em> only subtly hints that Furiosa was once one of Joe’s captive harem of wives and incubators — the white wrappings of Furiosa’s top evoke the Wives’ impractical shifts — Theron confirmed that piece of her backstory <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/05/14/mad-max-fury-road-charlize-theron-shaving-her-head-eating-dirt-and-being-part/">in interviews</a>. So Furiosa seems to have really personal reasons to hate Joe. And his response to her betrayal is presented as a towering rage, cresting mushroom cloud-like out of all proportion to her ability to withstand him. </p>
<p id="Qysz6h">Not to diminish the agency of the Five Wives in their own escape, but Joe considers them property that’s been stolen from him, not allies who betrayed him. Furiosa, however, he considers a traitor, worthy of his personal anger. And in the end, she’s the one who gets the honor of finally taking him down, underscoring her place on the same narrative level he occupies as <em>Fury Road</em>’s primary villain. </p>
<p id="bMELcL">Which is why it’s so wild that <em>Furiosa</em> says, quietly and implacably throughout its entire run time, that Joe actually isn’t even a main character in her story. Sure, he buys her, but then he forgets she even existed. He didn’t take anything from her that hadn’t already been taken, didn’t teach her anything she hadn’t already learned from someone else, didn’t give her anything she hadn’t already taken for herself. When they do share scenes, and even trade dialogue, there’s no interpersonal ire or affection in either direction. In spite of their characters’ intensity, Hulme and Taylor-Joy keep a neutral distance of emotion. </p>
<p id="IEnILb">It turns out, in <em>Furiosa</em>, that Furiosa’s life was actually framed by the completely different, utterly pathetic figure of Dementus, the Wasteland warlord who tortured her mother to death, sold Furiosa into slavery, killed her closest friend, and cost her her right arm. And just as emphatically, <em>Furiosa</em> says, Furiosa moved beyond revenge years before she ever stood against Joe. </p>
<p id="XDc91n">What you saw in <em>Fury Road</em>, <em>Furiosa</em> says, was the furthest thing from personal to Furiosa. Immortan Joe was never The Guy. He was just <em>the guy in the way</em>. And the “guy” part might be the most important one.</p>

<p id="VRPMea">The conversation that immediately surrounded <em>Fury Road</em> was about Immortan Joe as a Wasteland illustration of the death cult of capitalism and toxic masculinity. His very recognizable philosophy reduces all non-elites to things — women to Wives (sex slaves, forcibly impregnated) or Mothers (enslaved to produce breast milk for food), and men to War Boys (emphasis on <em>boys</em>), interchangeable cannon fodder addicted to the lie that they can only find purpose in violence for the True Leader. </p>
<p id="bLCboE">This was all emphasized by the emasculating nature of Furiosa’s rebellion. After all, by the language of a country-and-Western song, she’s wounded him in the most devastating way a man can be wounded, by stealing his wife (Wives), his money (water), his car (the War Rig), and maybe even his dog (Nicholas Hoult’s hapless character Nux, if we want to stretch the metaphor a little bit). </p>
<p id="rdDnNq">Immortan Joe is an electrifying villain, and <em>Furiosa</em> doesn’t exactly skimp on him! A scene contrasting Dementus’ shaky appeal to the self-interest of the masses with the unshakable belief created by Joe’s death-cult propaganda is among the film’s most chilling. But there is an eternal risk in presenting such an operatic villain who also represents such a wide-ranging theme. If you’re not careful, making them powerful and capable enough to claim villain status also risks making them look aspirational. You can swing right around to <a href="https://collider.com/darth-vaders-most-cool-bad-ass-moments/">making them seem cool</a>. </p>
<p id="ZDZL78">Which is why it’s so damn smart of <em>Furiosa</em> to put this final nail in the coffin of Joe’s emasculation, by establishing that <em>Fury Road</em>’s sense of personal beef was all on Joe — on <em>his</em> fear, and <em>his</em> vulnerability, not on Furiosa’s. He isn’t even important<em> to the woman who’s unmanning him</em>. </p>
<p id="m6TZKd">In a cliche reversal for the cinematic ages, Immortan Joe was, for Furiosa, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjZ5I8l32CI">just Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="125" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Fans who were looking forward to <em>Little Nightmares III</em> will unfortunately have to hold on, as the game has now been delayed. </p> <p data-characters="150" data-current-count="150" data-injectable="false">In a post on the official <em>Little Nightmares</em> Twitter, developer Supermassive Games revealed the game was being delayed, and would now release in 2025. </p> <figure data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">“As much as we can’t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves.” Supermassive <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> in the statement. “Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we’ve made the decision to shift the game to 2025.”</p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">“We’ll be sharing more about <em>Little Nightmares III</em> later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.” the developer promised. </p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false"><em>Little Nightmares III</em> was announced in 2023 with a 2024 release window. It is the first in the franchise to be developed by Supermassive. The game will follow two young protagonists, Low and Alone, as they explore a haunting 2.5D world that focuses on exploration, platforming, and puzzles. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">The previous games in the franchise were developed by Swedish-based Tarsier Studios, who had to leave the franchise when they were acquired by Embracer Group after the release of <em>Little Nightmares II</em>. Tarsier Studios does not currently have an announced project. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false"><em>Little Nightmares</em> has been a cherished franchise since its 2017 launch. The original game followed Six, a girl who had to escape the horrifying vessel known as The Maw. Though Six retuned for 2021’s <em>Little Nightmares II</em>, the character and compatriot Mono do not appear to be returning for <em>Little Nightmares III</em>. </p>

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-1-0-release-date-full-roster-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunch of <em>Multiversus</em></a> has already been a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-fans-are-split-on-jasons-ridiculously-chunky-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly divisive affair</a>, but fans took note that the game was missing some features. However, the dev assures the game is bringing those features back. </p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">Several features that were available in what PlayerFirst and the community are generously calling the Beta were missing, which obviously rubbed fans the wrong way. </p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">But Tony Huynh, the co-founder of Player 1st Games, took to social media to assure fans that those features would be restored soon. </p>  <figure data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks you for the feedback! The team is hard at work on it. Some of the missing settings and features from the open beta are incoming, team colors, end of game stats, swapping side and neutral attack, adjustable input buffer settings, etc. More info soon!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/multiversus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#multiversus</a></p>— Tony Huynh (@Tony_Huynh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1796903398920581259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">“Many of these features are currently implemented and are in testing and we had planned, but were left out due to time as we had to rebuild every screen and feature again to support our new netcode and Unreal Engine 5 switch.” Huynh revealed on his <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1796903400497684726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter/X</a> account. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">When <em>Multiversus</em> finally returned after its long hiatus, fans were quick to note features were missing that had added to the game’s online multiplayer. These components included leaderboards, match stats, a co-op vs AI mode, and a <em>Smash Bros</em>-like free-for-all mode that added random items. </p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">Also missing was the ability to play as an unowned character in training mode. Without this option, players are left with no means of test-driving a new character without unlocking them.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="false">In their place was a brand new season pass with unlockables and a new single-player driven “Rift” mode. The reception to the new <em>Multiversus</em> has been fairly mixed, but hopefully this is just a small bump for this already controversial game. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-top-5-best-call-of-duty-zombies-celebrity-guest-stars/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-top-5-best-call-of-duty-zombies-celebrity-guest-stars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">What started out as a little bonus mode in 2008’s <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> has become a global phenomenon. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-call-of-duty-zombies-modes-ranked/"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s <em>Zombies</em> mode</a> is a staple of the franchise, with complex lore, a sprawling multiverse, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-cod-zombies-maps-ranked/">varied maps</a>, and numerous now-iconic original characters behind it. Not to mention, more than a few celebrity guests have gotten in on the zombie-killing action.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">While the likes of Tank Dempsey (Steve Blum), Dr. Edward Richtofen (Nolan North), and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) have carried the mode from game to game, several notable pop culture favorites have briefly come along for the ride. Malcolm McDowell, Jeff Goldblum, the late Ray Liotta, and more have featured in the mode, and that’s just in Treyarch’s titles. Sledgehammer Games’ <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em> and <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em> boast celebrity guest stars of their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">While every celebrity cameo in the <em>Call of Duty Zombies</em> lineage has been fun, some are just a bit more special and noteworthy than others. Here are the top five best the Treyarch franchise has offered up to date.</p>  <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-helena-bonham-carter-as-madame-mirela" data-injectable="false">5. Helena Bonham-Carter as Madame Mirela</h2> <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>‘s<em> Dead of the Night</em> takes players to the manor of skilled archaeologist Alistair Rhodes (Charles Dennis), where all kinds of paranormal entities threaten the lives of those present. Alongside Gideon Jones (Kiefer Sutherland), Jonathan Warwick (Brian Blessed), and Godfrey (Charles Dance) is Christina Fowler, aka Madame Mirela, as portrayed in voice and likeness by Helena Bonham-Carter. She turns in a solid vocal performance here, and considering her entertainment track record, she was a perfect fit for the <em>Zombies</em> mode.</p>
 <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Bonham-Carter has made a career out of taking projects of the supernatural and macabre variety. <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>, <em>Corpse Bride</em>, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and more fill her filmography. She’s also among director Tim Burton’s most frequent collaborators, in addition to being his former romantic partner. Bonham-Carter took the role of Mirela seriously, too, telling <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/2464098/how-helena-bonham-carter-changed-her-call-of-duty-black-ops-4-character">CinemaBlend</a> that she personally crafted Mirela’s accent and channeled Mrs. Lovett, her <em>Sweeney Todd</em> character, to get her <em>Dead of the Night</em> performance just right.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-ron-perlman-as-floyd-campbell" data-injectable="false">4. Ron Perlman as Floyd Campbell</h2> <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="871" data-injectable="true">Kicking off <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>‘s <em>Zombies</em> mode, Treyarch put its latest celebrity-loaded map at the forefront. <em>Shadows of Evil </em>takes place in the run-down, paranormal Morgue City, where seedy inhabitants do vile things to get ahead. One of these individuals is Floyd Campbell: a washed-up boxer who’s willing to kill if it means getting to the top of his profession. Ultimately, he pays the price for his underhanded tactics. Ron Perlman’s unmistakable face and rumbling voice couldn’t be more suitable for the grizzled journeyman fighter.</p>
 <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">Much like Bonham-Carter, Perlman is no stranger to odd, paranormal fictional universes. He’s a mainstay in the works of director Guillermo del Toro, from <em>Cronos</em> to <em>Hellboy</em>, where strange is the name of the game. The surreal French fantasy flick <em>The City of Lost Children</em>, starring Perlman as carnival strongman One, also boasts a similar aesthetic to <em>Shadows of Evil</em>. All of this experience, coupled with the fact that Perlman told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7xcra2x6fs">IGN</a> he’d always wanted to play a boxer in some form, drove home the fact that no one could play Campbell quite like him.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-joe-pantoliano-as-al-the-weasel-arlington" data-injectable="false">3. Joe Pantoliano as Al “The Weasel” Arlington</h2> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="831" data-injectable="true">One of, if not the absolute best <em>Zombies</em> map to date, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>‘s <em>Mob of the Dead</em> features four mobsters attempting to escape Alcatraz Island via a shoddily-built plane. Not only are they unsuccessful, but they’re trapped in a time loop, forcing them to fend off endless waves of zombies, die, and repeat their failure over and over again for eternity. The mastermind of their initial escape plan is Al “The Weasel” Arlington, modeled after and voiced by Joe Pantoliano to utter perfection.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">In a cast chock-full of crime genre legends, Pantoliano very much stands out as <em>Mob of the Dead</em>‘s MVP. The <em>Sopranos</em>, <em>Matrix</em>, and <em>Bad Boys</em> actor was a prime choice to bring out Weasel’s meek and insecure yet innovative and intelligent personality. It’s just too bad that when the character returns in <em>Black Ops 4</em>‘s <em>Blood of the Dead</em>, he only does so as a bird in spirit form, thus preventing Pantoliano from getting another shot at the role.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-danny-trejo-as-himself" data-injectable="false">2. Danny Trejo as Himself</h2> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of the Dead</em> from <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops I</em> is the first <em>Call of Duty Zombies</em> map to feature a celebrity cast, and it goes all-out. When their horror film set is overrun, Robert Englund, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Michael Rooker have to fight off waves of zombies in the middle of Siberia. Danny Trejo joins them, signature machetes in hand, to slaughter the incoming undead. All four actors thrive with the material provided, but Trejo takes it to another level as only he can.</p>
 <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">To say that the <em>Machete</em> and <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> actor brings enthusiasm and gusto to the project would be a massive understatement. Trejo put his all into his lines, bringing a bit of comedy as well as plenty of badassery to match his tattooed, weaponed-up character model. The actor told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M9lIk19EyI">XboxViewTV</a> all about his experience working on <em>Call of the Dead</em> back in 2011, and while he’s not much of a gamer himself, it’s abundantly clear that he had a ton of passion for the endeavor.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-george-a-romero-as-himself" data-injectable="false">1. George A. Romero as Himself</h2> <p data-characters="619" data-current-count="919" data-injectable="true">Continuing on with <em>Call of the Dead</em>, it’s worth remembering who was directing the film that Trejo, Rooker, Englund, and Gellar were working on when they were ambushed by the undead. That person was none other than George A. Romero, who’s overpowered by zombies during the intro cutscene and turned into one himself. Throughout the game, he wanders the map with a stage light in hand and loads of one-liners. If you make Romero mad, he’ll fly into a rage, sprinting after you with his weapon of choice. All in all, there’s not a single soul more fitting to appear in a <em>Call of Duty</em> map than him. </p>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Romero is single-handedly responsible for crafting the modern image of a zombie through revolutionary films like <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>. Even years after his death in 2017, he continues to inspire the horror genre and those working within it. <em>Zombies</em> simply wouldn’t exist without Romero, so it’s only right that the visionary director was included in what has become one of the mode’s most beloved maps.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">For those unaware, <em>Black Ops 4</em>‘s <em>Tag Der Toten</em>, a <em>Call of the Dead</em> reimagining, features Romero’s signature glasses sitting on a table. This is both a fun <em>Call of the Dead</em> Easter egg and a tribute to the man who paved the way.</p>

<p data-characters="246" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There was a time when movies based on games and games based on movies were tied in terms of suckage, but we started to see a bunch of fantastic games based on movies long before we saw great game-to-movie or TV series adaptations such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fallout-characters-in-the-amazon-series-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout.</a></em></p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">That’s because there’s no actual curse regarding video game adaptations — so long as the game studios get the budget, time, and artistic liberty required to make them. Here are the games that will bring you the closest to actually living in the world of your favorite movies.</p>  <figure data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Thing</h2> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">If you’re sad about that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/shame-we-never-got-the-thing-as-a-point-and-click-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Thing</em></a>‘s 2011 prequel which threw away the practical effects of the original in favor of <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/the-thing-prequel-director-regrets-using-heavy-cgi-and-shares-details-on-scrapped-sequel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonky CGI</a>, then the video game might prove a good alternative for you. Sure, it features even more computed-generated imagery than the infamous sequel, but it does a great job of putting you in the action of a situation similar to the events of the original classic. 2002’s The Thing video game even features mechanics that add a lot of replay value by always keeping players guessing who the thing might be. It’s like living that masterfully chilling final scene — for eternity.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</h2> <p data-characters="594" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="true">A lot of people seem to have changed their minds regarding the prequel trilogy when they saw the sequel trilogy. I’ll meet them halfway and admit that <em>Episode I</em> is a good movie — if the only part of it that you recall is the podracer scene. It’s well-directed, features some great effects, and, weirdest of all, for something out of the prequels, it’s thrilling. LucasArts had the genius idea of just excising this gem imprisoned in that terrible movie and giving it room to breathe and grow. Why is Disney yet to make a series about podracing, or, better yet, another game?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via WB</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">Even though it came out just a few months after the massive <em>Mad Max: Fury Road,</em> the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Max</a> </em>video game failed to gain the traction that I believe it deserved among gamers — likely because it came out on the same day as <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em> . It made driving around the wasteland a surprisingly smooth experience, gave players a way to stay in that wicked universe outside of just having them rewatch the movie until the end of times, and even enriched <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the canon</a> with elements we’d later see in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Furiosa.</em> </a></p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Sadly, director George Miller <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/george-miller-didnt-2015-mad-162604475.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t too keen on it</a> and has said that he’d like to see Hideo Kojima taking a stab at a <em>Mad Max </em>game, but I think he’s underestimating this gem by Avalanche.</p>  <figure data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Alien: Isolation</h2> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">A considerable number of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-horror-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien</a></em> fans consider James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> superior to the original film. I believe that the only work in the franchise capable of rivaling the original is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-alien-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>. It makes the Xenomorph scarier than any other <em>Alien</em> property as it puts you in a maze as the prey with your wits as the only weapon on hand. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Bonus points for a mechanic where the game uses your microphone to detect any noises you make and alert the Xenomorph. Turns out someone can hear you scream in space, and that somehow makes it worse.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by FOX</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</h2> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"><em>The Chronicles of Riddick</em>‘s tie-in came out in 2004. This means that the FPS that was already <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/butcher-bay-sold-purely-on-word-of-mouth-better-than-word-of-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting an uphill</a> battle because of the whack property it was connected to even had to face off against the likes of <em>Doom 3, Far Cry, Halo 2, </em>and <em>Half-Life 2.</em> </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Miraculously, <em>Butcher Bay</em> is an order of magnitude above the movie that spawned it and also one that held its own in the best year in the history of FPS titles. You won’t find any groundbreaking gravity gun action in here, but the first-person stealth gameplay rivals that of the <em>Thief</em> and the <em>Dishonored</em> series.</p>  <figure data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Goldeneye 007</h2> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">You’ve probably heard of this one because it’s one of the greatest games of all time. Whether you’re more about wanting to be James Bond on a campaign to save the world or want to have some of the best split-screen action ever put on a split-screen, this is the one for you. </p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Many have tried to recapture <em>Goldeneye 007’s</em> magic, but only <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-split-screen-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very few have succeeded.</a></p>  <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Aspyr Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic</h2> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">Many games have already proven that the best way to adapt <em>Star Wars</em> is to ignore the source material and forge your own path ahead. <em>KOTOR</em> is the best example of the bunch, as it goes four thousand years into the past to tell a tale better than what we saw in most of the films. </p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">No other <em>Star Wars</em> film, game or TV series has ever done such a great job of making you feel like a true Jedi or Sith. Unfortunately, it seems like it’ll stay that way for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Spiderman 2 (2004) - Still the best web-swinging." width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikiuidSRcTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-spider-man-2" data-injectable="false">Spider-Man 2</h2> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true"><em>GTA 3</em> changed the entire landscape with its 3d free-roaming, and few games benefitted more than the <em>Spider-Man</em> series. </p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">The leap between the video game adaptation of the original <em>Spider-Man</em> game to the second was enormous, with most of it coming from ditching the regular level system in favour of allowing players to freely web-swing around a pretty good rendition of New York City. Even today, Spider-Man 2’s web-swinging is incredibly fun. </p> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Westwood</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Blade Runner</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><em>Blade Runner</em> was a flop when it was released in 1983, only finding its true audience with later releases, like the 1992 Director’s Cut. Despite this, 1997 saw Westwood making the counterintuitive decision of braving through hell to make their own video game adaptation. The company ended up revolutionizing both the gameplay and look of point-and-click adventure games.</p> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">My only gripe with the <em>Blade Runner</em> video game is that it sometimes sticks too closely to the film even though it supposedly tells a new story. Still, at least it mimics one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by LucasArts</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Indiana Jones and The Fate Of Atlantis</h2> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">One of the best things about being a gamer is that you don’t have to be as disappointed at <em>Indiana Jones</em> as movie fans. Not crazy about <em>Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull</em> or <em>Dial of Destiny</em>? Then perhaps you’ll be happy with one of the excellent video game releases. </p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">1992 saw the release of <em>Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis</em>, a point-and-click adventure title made in the old LucasArts SCUMM engines. Quite simply, <em>Fate of Atlantis</em> is possibly as good as <em>Raiders Of The Lost Ark</em> and perhaps better than <em>Temple Of Doom</em> or <em>Last Crusade</em>. An excellent game that filled a gap when there was no new Indy for a long, long time. </p>

            <p>"Come one, come all" – Diablo 4 is about to celebrate its first anniversary, and Blizzard has "a goblin's heap of rewards" to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>As a thank you "for being part of the Diablo community through another year of fighting back the demonic forces of Hell", the March of the Goblins will kick off next week across both Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal, which is also marking its second anniversary.</p>

<p>First off, you can claim a free cosmetic gift from the Shop in Diablo 4 from 6th June, and you'll have "until 20th June to claim all of these gifts". At the same time, you'll see a boost in Treasure Goblin activity across the Sanctuary, "with Horadric scholars foretelling the contents of their greed-filled bags rumoured to be richer than ever before".</p>
<p>"The townsfolks are predicting that greed shrines will appear with increased frequency, bolstering the riches of these shrewd goblins. Even stranger still, while in Dungeons, Goblins are supposedly appearing in pairs… with some tall tales insisting an even larger pack of them together," the team teases in a lengthy <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>But that's not all. During the "anniversary edition of Mother's Blessing", you can earn a 25 percent XP bonus and a 50 percent multiplicative increase in gold, too, for a full 10 days.</p>
<p>"Lilith blesses all her children, as this bonus applies to both Seasonal and Eternal Realms, and all World Tiers," the post explains. "This bonus also stacks, so pair it with Elixirs and the Urn of Aggression to maximize your experience gains while killing Monsters. Use this limited-time boost to carve through ranks of the Battle Pass, climb to higher Levels and World Tiers with burning swiftness, complete your Season Journey, and level multiple characters to their maximum potential."</p>
<p>As for Diablo Immortal? From 6th June until the end of the month, you'll be able to loot treasure in the Trial of Plunder and take on Diablo 4's Avarice in the Gold-Cursed Goliath boss fight. And the goblins are marching through Immortal, too, offering anniversary-themed weekly tasks to boost your gold and progression.</p>
<p>"The Gold-Cursed will not be easily felled in his rampage," Blizzard explains. "Competing in the Trial of Plunder has a chance to earn you a Gold-Cursed Portal, which can be used to summon a portal that teleports you to Avarice immediately. There is also a chance to encounter a Gold-Cursed Portal randomly in the wild, teleporting you directly to slay this greedy behemoth."</p>
<p>Players will also be able to claim a "mysterious band news quality 2, five-star Stormvault Legendary Gem", too.</p>
<p>For the full rundown, head on over to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst the franchise has long been associated with its dedicated PC fanbase, an email sent from Xbox president Sarah Bond in April intimated that Diablo 4 – which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">acquired by Microsoft as part of its $68.7m acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, of course – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-the-number-one-platform-for-diablo-4-players-says-xbox-president">is more popular on the Xbox console system</a>, even though the RPG is also available on PC and PlayStation consoles, too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape.887562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-exotic-armor-is-changing-destiny-2-the-final-shape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2’s</a></em>&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>expansion is just a few days away, and alongside everything new coming to the game, the existing status quo will change. Some Exotic armor effects are due for tweaks, both to support the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/we-now-know-all-of-destiny-2s-prismatic-subclass-abilities/">new Prismatic Subclass</a> and to adjust the meta as needed.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Bungie has been using the window up to&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape’s</em>&nbsp;release to highlight how&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>would change. The studio has already detailed some&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-new-exotic-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Exotics</a>&nbsp;and what players could expect from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-weapons-and-perks-will-change-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons in the new expansion</a>, and now it’s showing the alterations being made to existing Exotic armor.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">General changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">While most of the changes to Exotic armor affect the Class that can use the item, Bungie outlined a few alterations that would hit on a more global scale. The first of these is simple, but it helps meld more Exotic effects into the new Prismatic Subclass. Exotic effects that require a specific Subclass element will only need a matching Super in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. This opens up buildcrafting opportunities, as Prismatic won’t technically be any one element.</p>
 <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">A welcome update to all Exotic armor is that the gear will support an Artifice slot in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. Traditionally, Artifice armor could only be earned in Dungeons on Master difficulty, but more recently, Bungie extended the offering to the Competitive PvP playlist. The bonus slot on this gear allows players to add a zero-cost +3 boost to any chosen stat. Guardians will be able to Masterwork Exotic armor as usual and then purchase the Artifice slot for 1 Exotic Cipher and 10,000 Glimmer.</p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Ammo Finder armor mods are also set to see a slight change. As they are, a player’s death resets progress toward another ammo drop, making reliable gains difficult for those who die frequently. Bungie is altering the effect to persist through death but compensating by increasing the number of kills to create an ammo drop. As another small bonus, the unique Raid mods only available on Raid armor will be free to equip in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Warlock</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Mantle of Battle Harmony&nbsp;</strong>– This Exotic has always had a pretty solid effect, increasing Super energy gained while uncharged and then switching to an elemental damage buff matching Subclass choice. The 2-second cooldown between Super energy gains will be removed, and more Super energy will be granted based on the type of enemy defeated.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Ballidorse Wrathweavers</strong>&nbsp;– Ballidorse Wrathweavers will still improve Shatter damage for the Winter’s Wrath Super, and it will also provide max stacks of Frost Armor to nearby allies. The user gets Frost Armor once the Super ends and Rifts also grant full stacks of Frost Armor when using the Frostpulse Aspect.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Secant Filaments</strong>&nbsp;– The Exotic already grants Devour when using a Warlock Rift and allows Guardians to disrupt enemies from within the Rift. Now, Secant Filaments will also refresh the Devour buff when reentering the Rift.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Verity’s Brow</strong>&nbsp;– The effect is unchanged, providing a grenade damage buff and offering grenade energy, but instead of triggering from elemental weapon kills tied to a Guardian’s Subclass, it will now function off of elemental weapon kills tied to grenade choice.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Sunbracers</strong>&nbsp;– Sunbracers allows players to throw multiple Solar grenades after eliminating a foe with a powered melee charge. Now, the number of possible grenades has decreased from 5 to 4, and each Solar only lasts an additional 2 seconds, down from 4.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Cenotaph Mask</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic quickly became popular, allowing Warlocks to generate ammo for their team by marking Champions or other formidable adversaries with trace rifle fire. Players can no longer trigger Cenotaph Mask’s effects multiple times on a single target, and the visual mark indicator will now be hidden from the user.</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Titan</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Ursa Furiosa</strong>&nbsp;– In addition to its existing effects buffing the Sentinal Shield Super and refunding Super energy based on guarded damage, Ursa Furiosa will allow Guardians to move faster while guarding with the new Unbreakable Void Aspect and reward scaled Super energy for blocking damage.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Eternal Warrior</strong>&nbsp;– Eternal Warrior remains largely unchanged except for removing the requirement to run an Arc Subclass.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Armamentarium</strong>&nbsp;– Besides the existing effect that adds an extra grenade charge, the Exotic will also grant Orbs of Power for grenade kills.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Khepri’s Horn</strong>&nbsp;– Khepri’s Horn provides Barricade energy for Solar kills, and Barricades send forth a returning Scorching wave. The wave has been improved, increasing PvE damage by 100%, applying Scorch each time it hits foes, and working with both Ember of Eruption and Ember of Ashes.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong>&nbsp;– Hear of Inmost Light’s functionality is unchanged, buffing players’ other two abilities after using one. However, its three buffs have been consolidated to save UI space.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Synthoceps</strong>&nbsp;– This exotic still buffs Handling and Reload Speed on top of granting a melee and Super damage bonus when surrounded. That said, Bungie decreased the time the buffs remain active from 8 seconds to 5.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Severance Enclosure&nbsp;</strong>– Severance Enclosure creates an explosion when defeating enemies with a powered melee, amplifying the effect with Finishers or against more difficult enemies. Bungie tweaked the effect only to go off after players spend a melee charge to eliminate an enemy. The explosions now also require line of sight to trigger, and knockback has been lessened.</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-hunter" data-injectable="false">Hunter</h2> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Assassin’s Cowl&nbsp;</strong>– Like Severance Enclosure, Assassin’s Cowl will also require an expended melee charge to trigger its effects. However, those effects remain unchanged, granting invisibility, health, and shields after players use a powered melee to defeat an enemy.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Triton Vice&nbsp;</strong>– Triton Vice buffs glaives, increasing damage and reload speed when enemies are nearby. Glaive melee kills overflow the weapon, and projectile kills cause a detonation. Bungie is removing the previous requirement for the glaive to match Guardians’ Subclass for the projectile detonations to function. Additionally, the buffs granted for being surrounded will linger for 5 seconds.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>The Dragon’s Shadow</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic lets a Hunter dodge reload all weapons, buffing movement speed, and weapon handling. It will also apply its effects when using Ensnaring Slam or the upcoming Ascension Arc Aspect.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Foetracer</strong>&nbsp;– Currently, Foetracer grants a weapon matching the element of your Subclass a damage bonus when players damage an enemy with an ability. It also creates elemental pickups when enemies are defeated using a weapon that’s the same element as your Subclass. In&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, Foetracer will function based on the element of the ability used rather than the equipped Subclass.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>The Sixth Coyote</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic grants another charge of dodge. Bungie has updated The Sixth Coyote to include the Reaper armor mod, granting Orbs of Power when players eliminate a foe after dodging.</li> </ul>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Renewal Grasps</strong>&nbsp;– Renewal Grasps increase the size of the Duskfield grenade effect, reducing damage to allies and making enemies deal decreased damage. Bungie is updating Renewal Grasps to incorporate Frost Armor, replacing the generic damage reduction. Players will gain one stack of Frost Armor upon entering the Duskfield grenade and an additional stack every 0.9 seconds.</li> </ul> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Star-Eater Scales</strong>&nbsp;– This Exotic allows players to earn more Super energy from Orbs of Power and Orbs of Power collected while at full Super energy provide a damage buff, overshield, and healing when the Super is cast. This can stack up to four times. For<em>&nbsp;The Final Shape</em>, Bungie tweaked Star-Eater Scales, making the full buff effects require 6 Orbs of Power pickups while at full Super energy, up from four. The Super energy gained from Orbs of Power while using the Golden Gun Super has decreased from 2% to 0.5%.</li> </ul>

  <p id="rE75RJ">How do you top something that’s already ridiculously, joyfully, emphatically over the top? That’s the big existential question George Miller faced in making <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em></a>, the hard-charging prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. The first film is maximalist to a fault, with screaming, bald, white-painted War Boys gleefully spray-painting their teeth chrome before throwing themselves to their deaths, and chase after chase featuring a giant War Rigs and nigh-infinite smaller vehicles covered in skulls, chains, creepy dolls, and anything else the designers could graft on.</p>
<p id="Ln9UN0">But nothing in the movie is more over the top than the Doof Warrior, the fan-favorite hard-rocker who bungie-hops around a giant stack of speakers, dressed in red long johns and his <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161947/mad-max-fury-road-doof-warrior-origins-furiosa-george-miller">dead mother’s face</a>, wielding a fire-spitting guitar as he plays sick licks to inspire Immortan Joe’s hyped-up collection of Valhalla-minded dummies to go even harder in combat. Recently, a group of Polygon staffers were discussing <em>Furiosa</em>, and someone asked, “Who’s the Doof Warrior equivalent in this movie?”</p>
<p id="RKgotJ">The most obvious answer is that there isn’t one — at least, there isn’t someone who’s ridiculous in the same way and on the same level. But one of the best things about <em>Furiosa</em> is that Miller isn’t just trying to copycat himself, so he doesn’t, say, throw a flame-spewing brass band into his new movie to up the ante on something that was already perfect. But in terms of who <em>Furiosa</em>’s breakout character might be — who might inspire fan art and fan engagement, once more people have seen the movie — well, we’ve got different opinions on that one. Witness us!</p>

<p id="yeJ5pH">Jack is in some ways the exact opposite of the Doof Warrior — quiet where DW is showy, content to disappear into a crowd instead of living for the spectacle, and a much more stylish dresser. (Red PJs are <em>so</em> pre-apocalypse.) But I think he may be the character who goes the distance in the fandom, because like the Doof Warrior, he stands out as radically different from everyone else. There’s just so little space in the Mad Maxiverse for people who do their jobs without yelling about it constantly and trying to make every success seem bigger and more praiseworthy than it actually is.</p>
<p id="HvXoFO">And his connection with Furiosa seems designed to leave a mark on viewers — maybe even a bigger mark than it leaves on Furiosa herself. She’s so revenge-driven that she doesn’t have much room in her life for other people, but she makes room for Praetorian Jack, maybe because he’s polite enough not to take up more space there than she’s willing to give. There isn’t a lot of space in the Wasteland for tenderness or compassion, either, as Dementus tells us. The fact that Praetorian Jack manages to bring that into the franchise, too, makes him memorable even as one of the series’ most undemanding characters. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="WAvtOV">The only thing the Wastelanders of the Mad Max franchise respect more than power and violence is branding. Surviving on the Fury Road is all about picking a theme, scrapping together a cool costume, and giving yourself a nutso name that people are too scared not to call you. And the person who does all that the best in <em>Furiosa </em>is the Octoboss. </p>
<p id="8pQF36">Dementus’ onetime ally, who eventually makes it clear that he’s out for his own gains instead, fills all the criteria of one of the Wasteland’s great weirdos. He’s got a terrific helmet, pitch-black and probably impossible to see out of, with towering horns that surely affect his balance, and a squad of loyal riders who will die at his command. But just as importantly, he also knows how to go out like a badass. Sure, he gets shredded at the end of his ill-fated attempt at conquest, but God, what a beautiful, tentacle-y mess he leaves behind him! As an added bonus, his octopus costume also gives us one of the movie’s most stunning visual moments, and one of the clearest indicators that Miller is going for something far more painterly and strange than the look he attempted in <em>Fury Road</em>. —<em>Austen Goslin </em></p>

<p id="bMKguE">OK, to be real, nobody’s going to fixate on Smeg, Dementus’ weaselly, hunched hype man. Smeg’s entire existence appears to be built around standing next to the warlord and reiterating the front-facing emotion of his statements in exaggerated mimicry, cringing low to show sympathy and shaking his fists to show triumph. Like a more versatile, albeit mute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkAK9QRe4ds">Anger Translator</a>. </p>
<p id="SBrvYD">No, I don’t expect to see much of Smeg at Comic-Con — <em>maybe</em> a couples’ Halloween costume featuring Dementus and his most front-and-center hanger-on.

<p id="3LpqMd">Quaden Bayles’ War Pup has just one job: He runs the Bommyknocker, the contraption attached to the rear of the War Rig. Immortan Joe’s mechanics are very proud of the Bommyknocker, and when it hits the road for the first time, War Pup is excited to finally use this ultimate weapon on the Fury Road — which is relatable, because I spent that whole sequence similarly excited about eventually seeing what the Bommyknocker could do! But in the Wasteland, we’re all punchlines. Right when it’s time to finally use the Bommyknocker, War Pup takes a bullet to the brain, and he never gets to see how freaking metal it is in action. </p>
<p id="H53Z80">To me, War Pup is most like the Doof Warrior in that he has a very specific function that the audience is hyped to see, but he also seems much more interesting than the limited role he has in the Wasteland. Maybe we’ll learn more about him in some form or another eventually, but meanwhile, the actor who plays him has a story that lives up to the hype. Bayles went viral in 2020 after a bullying incident, picked on for his achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. When Bayles’ story was noticed by Australian news media, <a href="https://ew.com/movies/george-miller-bullied-australian-boy-furiosa/">Miller reached out to give him a small role</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23321766/three-thousand-years-of-longing-review-george-miller-mad-max-fury-road"><em>Three Thousand Years of Longing</em></a> — and liked him enough to keep working with him on <em>Furiosa</em>. Witness him! —<em>Joshua Rivera </em></p>

            <p>Embark has pushed out a hotfix for The Finals, addressing the extraordinarily frustrating exploit that enabled players to track opponents through walls.</p>
<p>In a brief update on the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/2104">official website</a>, the team said the update was designed "for many of the issues introduced in Update 2.10.0" earlier in the week, starting with the broken aim assist to "prevent tracking enemy contestants through objects such as walls, terrain, etc".</p>

<p>The hotfix also fixes enemy healthbars – they were not only persisting on screen longer than intended, but also popped up through walls and terrain, too – and another issue where players <em>couldn't</em> track contracts in rookie/challenger/pro/master circuits.</p>
<p>The team has also reverted a change that removed directional weapon binding for controllers, and fixed the incorrect message that pops up when players are "restricted from playing". The update also addresses another exploit wherein players could fire the FAMAS, Throwing Knives, and the R93 (among other weapons) "at a much higher rate" "during animation cancelling".</p>
<p>The Finals seemed to get off to a strong start when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-the-finals-has-stealth-dropped-and-is-available-right-now">surprise-launched in December</a> last year - its 5v5 action proving popular enough that its developer, Nexon subsidiary Embark Studios, quickly found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-ups-anti-cheat-measures-following-popular-launch">scrambling to deal with an influx of cheaters</a>. Since then, however, the destruction-focused free-to-play shooter has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destructive-shooter-the-finals-hasnt-performed-as-well-as-expected-says-publisher">"lower than expected" performance</a> according to publisher Nexon, contributing to a shortfall in its forecast revenue.</p>
<p>"Embark Studios' multiplayer shooter dazzles in the moment, but its AI voices are symptomatic of a broader issue with artistic vision", wrote contributor Rick Lane in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">three star review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169568/microsoft-copilot-plus-gaming-pc-nvidia-amd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia and AMD are gearing up to launch gaming laptops that include the AI Copilot Plus features that Microsoft just announced for Qualcomm-powered laptops. At Computex today, Nvidia briefly teased that “RTX AI PC” laptops are on the way from Asus and MSI that will eventually include Copilot Plus PC features.</p><p>“Newly announced RTX AI PC laptops from ASUS and MSI feature up to GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs and power-efficient systems-on-a-chip with Windows 11 AI PC capabilities,” says Nvidia in a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-ai-assistants-to-life-with-geforce-rtx-ai-pcs">blog post</a>. Nvidia confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> in a briefing that these laptops will come with AMD’s latest Strix CPUs.</p><p>AMD hasn’t officially detailed its AMD Strix laptop CPUs yet, which it will undoubtedly announce during its own <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/events/computex.html">keynote later today</a>. Nvidia has also dropped a hint that the first AMD-powered Copilot Plus PCs might not get Microsoft’s round of AI features at launch, though.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s RTX AI laptops with Copilot Plus features are coming soon.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“These Windows 11 AI PCs will receive a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available,” says Nvidia in a blog post. That suggests that Microsoft might not be ready to launch Recall and the other AI-powered Windows features on AMD chips, or that there could be some period of exclusivity for the Windows on Arm Qualcomm-powered hardware that launches on June 18th. Either way, we’ve reached out to Nvidia to clarify what its brief mention of this free update means.</p><p>Nvidia is also in a battle of sorts to remain relevant for AI-powered tasks on laptops. While Microsoft is pushing ahead with offloading AI models to NPUs, Nvidia is gearing up to make its GPUs useful in this AI battleground on PC. Nvidia is leaning hard into its branding of “RTX AI laptops,” noting that its GPUs are more capable of running heavier AI workloads than an NPU.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RTX AI Toolkit arrives in June.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>It’s even launching an <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ai-toolkit">RTX AI Toolkit</a> in June that includes tools and SDKs for model customization, optimization, and deployment. These tools will take something like Meta’s Llama 2 model and optimize it to run with far less VRAM requirements and with more performance. </p><p>Nvidia is also collaborating with Microsoft on the underlying AI models that are being built into Windows 11. “The collaboration will provide application developers with easy application programming interface (API) access to GPU-accelerated small language models (SLMs) that enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities that run on-device powered by Windows Copilot Runtime,” says Nvidia.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161688/microsoft-windows-copilot-runtime-build-2024">Microsoft announced its Windows Copilot Runtime</a> at Build last month, and Nvidia says its work to accelerate AI models using RTX GPUs will be released in developer preview later this year. Microsoft’s Windows Copilot Runtime is designed to make it easy for developers to add AI-powered features to their apps, all while relying on NPU hardware to accelerate those features, or GPUs from Nvidia soon.</p><p>Since NPUs are currently at the ~40 TOPS performance mark and Nvidia’s PC GPUs can handle more than 1,000 TOPS for AI acceleration, there are clearly some big differences in performance for developers to think about here. NPUs are designed for smaller models and important high power efficiency in laptops, but GPUs can do a good job handling larger models with higher performance in PC desktops where battery life isn’t relevant.</p><p>It’s going to be interesting to watch this AI battle on PC shakeout, especially as Microsoft holds the keys to lighting up these experiences natively in Windows for Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and its many OEM partners.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, seven years later, G-Assist is back as a real demo of a powerful GeForce AI assistant that Nvidia might eventually bring to life for game developers and RTX GPU owners.</p><p>Project G-Assist is only a tech demonstration right now, but it’s a brief look at how an AI assistant could guide you through PC games and even configure optimal settings for you based on chat inputs in the future.</p><p>In a demo, Nvidia shows G-Assist responding to voice queries asking “what’s the next early game weapon and where do I find the crafting materials for it?” inside <em>ARK: Survival Ascended. </em>The assistant can even understand what’s happening on the screen as you play, so it can tailor itself to how many skill points you have in a game and help guide you through. Microsoft showed off a similar demo for its vision of how its Copilot AI assistant could <a href="https://x.com/mustafasuleyman/status/1792623877744623806">guide <em>Minecraft</em></a><em> </em>players through the game last month.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s G-Assist demo.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Nvidia’s own AI assistant can also optimize and tune PC settings, including providing charts of PC latency and frames per second over the past 60 seconds. It can scan your system and notice you’re only playing at 60Hz when your monitor supports 240Hz. You can also ask the assistant for recommendations to increase performance in a game, hit a 60fps performance target, or even overclock your GPU.</p><p>I’m a sucker for a slick demo as much as the next person, but until G-Assist is an app I can download and play with, I’m hesitant to buy into the AI hype given how generative AI regularly makes mistakes. The fact that Microsoft and Nvidia are both demonstrating AI assistants that could eventually guide people through games makes me think that this will progress from demo to reality real soon. though.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA's Computex 2024 keynote was largely focused on AI, but there were also a couple of <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-brings-ai-assistants-to-life-with-geforce-rtx-ai-pcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> for gamers, starting with the fact that Star Wars Outlaws will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 after all.</p>
<p>We already knew that the game developed by Ubisoft Massive would support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reveals-star-wars-outlaws-black-myth-wukong-and-naraka-bladepoint-are-all-getting-dlss-3-and-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS</a> Super Resolution and Frame Generation, in addition to <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray-traced global illumination and RTX Direct Illumination</a>. However, it looked like Ray Reconstruction would be left out of it, possibly because Massive preferred Snowdrop's built-in denoiser.</p>
<p>Today's news means the developers of Star Wars Outlaws have decided to switch to NVIDIA's AI-optimized denoiser after all. As a reminder, Ray Reconstruction was first introduced in CD Projekt RED's <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-is-the-most-beautiful-technically-advanced-game-with-path-tracing-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> where it successfully replaced multiple denoisers with a single one that improved the quality of ray tracing and slightly enhanced performance. Later in 2023, Remedy also launched Alan Wake 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-gets-stunning-debut-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a>. The same feature will be added to NARAKA: Bladepoint and Black Myth: Wukong. It's also already available in RTX Remix.</p>
<p>Speaking of RTX Remix, NVIDIA announced today that its AI-powered game remastering toolkit will go open source later this month. This will allow the community of over 20K modders to streamline the way assets are replaced and scenes are relit, increase the number of file formats supported for the RTX Remix asset ingestor, and add new models to the RTX Remix AI texture tools.</p>
<p>In addition, NVIDIA is exposing the capabilities of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-toolkit-updated-by-nvidia-with-many-qol-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix Toolkit</a> via a REST API, enabling modders to integrate RTX Remix with digital content creation tools such as Blender, modding tools like Hammer, and generative AI applications like ComfyUI. Perhaps the most exciting RTX Remix news is that NVIDIA will provide an SDK for the RTX Remix Runtime to enable modders to extend the renderers into other applications and games beyond DirectX 8 and 9 classics. This may increase compatibility with DX10+ games, which at the moment is close to non-existent.</p>

<p>Back on the gaming front, NetEase's superhero team-based PvP shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-an-overwatch-like-6v6-pvp-third-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> will also support NVIDIA DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation).

		<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is set to premiere on Netflix on October 10th, as confirmed by the streaming service. This show should not be confused with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/tomb-raider-amazon-phoebe-waller-bridge/">Tomb Raider show officially that is being created for Amazon&nbsp;</a>being written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, with Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft being an animated series.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft picks up where the recent game trilogy left off, which included Tomb Raider 2013, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. The series serves as a narrative bridge connecting the new trilogy with the earlier Tomb Raider games that are set further along in Lara Croft’s life. While the exact number of episodes has not been confirmed, Netflix did make the initial order for two seasons.</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell has been cast in the role of Lara Croft, with Earl Baylon reprising his role as Jonah Maiava and Allen Maldonado voicing Zip. Tasha Huo, who previously worked on The Witcher: Blood Origin, serves as the showrunner for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft and is also involved with the Red Sonja project.</p>

I also went to the company’s US headquarters to open up an ROG Ally X with my own screwdrivers and play with the new build. I took plenty of pics, because I want you to nerd out with me. </p><p>But first, let me remind you what the ROG Ally X <em>is not</em>. Here’s what I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">last month</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Don’t call it an Ally 2: when it ships in the second half of the year, the Windows-based Ally X will have the same AMD Z1 Extreme chipset and the same 7-inch 48–120Hz VRR screen. It’s not quite like&nbsp;the Steam Deck OLED, where Valve got AMD to revise its chip for better battery life and stability and added a larger, brighter, gorgeous new OLED panel with improved response time and slimmer bezels.</p></blockquote></div><p>The ROG Ally X is a revision, not a sequel, and it’s a pricier one. It still runs Windows, and I still firmly believe Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20been%20almost%20a%20full%20year%20since%20Asus%20released%20the%20ROG%20Ally%20and%20over%20two%20years%20since%20the%20Steam%20Deck">drags gaming handhelds down</a>. But the Ally X might be the best Windows handheld yet — because Asus has crammed a monster 80 watt-hour battery into a handheld that <em>doesn’t feel </em>heavy, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on">one that fits my average-sized hands better</a> than any Windows handheld I’ve tried. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->18</p><p><figcaption><em>Want to see some comparisons to the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck? Here’s a quick hardware tour:</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At 1.49 pounds (678g), the ROG Ally X is only 0.15 pounds (70g) heavier than the original, and it’s only 0.18 inches (4.5mm) thicker at its thickest point. It’s almost exactly the same weight as the original Steam Deck, and almost half an inch thinner, but with twice as much battery capacity inside. </p><p>How? While the bigger battery added over 120 grams of weight, Asus was able to offset half of it by making other components lighter. Krohn says a stronger, thinner, lighter chassis offered the biggest savings — the weight of the talcum-filled ABS / polycarbonate composite went from 176 grams to 134 grams by the time Asus was done. (I did run into one side effect of the stiffer plastic blend: it’s harder to pop it open for repair.)</p><p>The Ally X has lighter circuit boards, too, shaving away lots of unnecessary board, and a lighter cooling module — including 23-percent smaller fans that are actually <em>more</em> powerful, because the company’s in-house design team created its own custom set of 77 ultra-thin blades that trump the 47 of the original. Krohn says you might see the Ally run a couple degrees cooler, and the thinner blades help reduce the audible noise bump at around 5,000Hz, too. </p><p>And, there’s a new series of vents that let the Ally X cool its touchscreen more effectively — up to 6°C cooler.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->11</p><p><figcaption><em>Let’s tour the Ally X internals, starting with the 80Wh battery.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The joysticks are another place where they’re both better <em>and</em> lighter: completely revised modular boards now use the same high-grade potentiometer based ALPS sticks you’ll find in a PS5 or Xbox gamepad, with far tighter throw than the original Ally, delightfully tacky concave tops a la Steam Deck OLED, wider bases for better dust resistance, and low friction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene">POM plastic</a> stems for smoother action when they scrape against the joystick ring’s edge.</p><p>They’re rated to 5 million rotation cycles, up from 2 million, and if that’s not enough, they’re modular — ready for a drift-resistant <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsBw3nxAzfY/">Hall Effect magnetic joystick upgrade kit</a> that Gulikit already has in development. (Krohn says not enough gamers prefer Hall Effect sticks for them to come standard, which... maybe?)</p><p>And, Asus has seemingly addressed almost all of the biggest complaints about I/O: </p><p>You get a full-length M.2 2280 PCIe 4 SSD slot now, one which supports double-sided drives too, opening up both the highest capacity and the most cost effective storage options on the market. </p><p>Asus has also ditched its proprietary XG Mobile eGPU port for a second USB-C port, one that offers all the benefits of Thunderbolt 4 too: 40Gbps speeds, 100W USB-C PD charging, DP 1.4 video output, and 4 lanes of PCIe for standard eGPUs. (No <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152087/ayaneo-plans-ornate-ag01-graphics-starship-egpu-dock">Oculink</a>, sorry.)</p><p>Both ports are top-mounted, but Krohn says that lets even the weaker one offer 100W charging and 10Gbps data.</p><div><p>And yes, Asus says you get a <em>new</em> SD card reader that is <em>not</em> the same as the one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20Asus%20still%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20that%20the%20Ally%E2%80%99s%20SD%20card%20reader%20ever%20had%20any%20fault">that Asus won’t admit has an issue</a>.</p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X one-pager. 24GB RAM means the GPU and system basically no longer need to share.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Here are some of the smaller details I learned:</p><div><ul><li>The D-pad is not only eight-way now, it’s also larger and more comfortable.

			<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on IGN</a>, Take-Two is planning to sell or shut down its indie publishing label, Private Division. The NYC-based publisher was founded in December 2017 to help bring games from smaller developers to market.</p>
<p>It published games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ancestors-humankind-odyssey-humans-were-a-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disintegration-explosive-cracked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disintegration</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rollerdrome-the-grind-is-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rollerdrome</a>. However, in April, most employees were told they would be laid off as Take-Two is pulling the rug under Private Division. Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games and OlliOlli World developer Roll7 are also on the verge of being shut down.</p>
<p>For now, a skeleton crew remains in place to honor the deals with Moon Studios (for No Rest for the Wicked, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> just about three months ago on Steam Early Access), Wētā Workshop (for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-is-a-cozy-hobbit-life-sim-out-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales of the Shire</a>, due later this year), and Pokémon developer Game Freak, which is currently working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-freak-pokemon-is-working-on-a-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new action/adventure IP</a> codenamed Project Bloom. Meanwhile, earlier this week, Private Division backed down from the partnership <a href="https://wccftech.com/private-division-and-bloober-team-partner-up-for-new-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late 2022 with Bloober Team.</p>
<p>The Polish developer noted <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/espi/pl/reports/view/2,561716#pvy7zfso61" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an official report</a>:</p>
<p><em>Observing the situation on the global gaming market, Bloober Team has taken such a scenario into account and is prepared for potential alternative solutions. As of the date of publication of the current report, the Company continues work on Project C in accordance with the planned production and marketing schedule in the self-publishing model. At the same time, Bloober Team does not rule out the possibility of continuing this production based on cooperation with a new publisher. The current situation of the Company allows maintaining the assumptions of the Strategic Plan adopted by the Company for 2023-2027. This situation may constitute a significant opportunity to increase the potential revenues related to this title.</em></p>
<p>Private Division clearly isn't profitable any longer for Take-Two, which is reportedly trying to sell the Kerbal Space Program IP, possibly in a bundle with developer Intercept Games. Moreover, the entire label might be sold to a private equity firm, though the report says a deal hasn't been reached yet.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is coming to Netflix on October 10, as confirmed recently by a new trailer showcasing the all-animated series. It was back in 2021 that the series was announced, and we finally have the lowdown on who will be voicing Lara Croft in this production.</p>



<p>It’s Hayley Atwell, known best for her work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Peggy Carter. In comments online, fans of the Tomb Raider franchise have praised Netflix for their casting choice, sounding off with the firm consensus that Atwell offers the perfect vocal representation of the iconic heroine.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-lara-croft">The Legend of Lara Croft</h2>



<p>On October 10, 2024, a new Lara Croft will surface on Netflix in an exclusive animated series, voiced by Hayley Atwell. Most recently, Lara Croft has been played (consistently) by Camilla Luddington, who has upheld the identity of the game-based character since 2013’s reboot, known as Tomb Raider. She would reprise the role in Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>On the big screen, many will claim that Angelina Jolie’s portrayal of the video game legend will go unbeaten until the end of time, but Alicia Vikander did a fine job in 2018’s Tomb Raider.</p>



<p>Now, the mantle passes to Hayley Atwell, who voices Lara Croft through eight episodes of the first season of The Legend of Lara Croft. Admittedly, it’s yet another ‘reboot’ or reinterpretation of Lara Croft in another universe, but it’s one that fans are very excited about.</p>

<p>Gamers don’t die, they respawn – right? </p>



<p>Recently, a debate was struck up online when some Steam users took an interest in what happens to their library of games when they pass away. It was a topic that was picked up with Valve, who subsequently confirmed that <strong>nothing happens</strong> – they can’t pass the ownership of your account to someone else or ‘merge it’ with someone else’s library if you die, and it can’t be transferred via a will.</p>



<p>Now, gamers are getting increasingly concerned about what happens to their game libraries when they die.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-be-prepared">Be Prepared</h2>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://respawnfirst.com/what-happens-to-your-gog-account-if-you-die-gog-confirms-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by RespawnFirst</a>, the team at GOG – a competing storefront to Steam – was probed about this topic, with the RF squad asking what would happen to their library if they were to suffer from an untimely passing.</p>



<p>GOG was a little more forthcoming and lenient than the stricter employees at Valve:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable. However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account… we’ll do our best to make it happen. We’re willing to handle such situations and preserve your GOG library, but currently need the help of the justice system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>RF also discovered that Epic Games won’t transfer your account to another user in the case of your death, either. But what about other platforms and providers? In 2022, 89.5% of all games sold in the United Kingdom were digital, so there are vast libraries out there stacked to the brim with titles that true gamers wouldn’t want to go to waste.</p>



<p>For the most part, it seems as though when a gamer dies, they take their libraries with them. Of course, if you’re able to get into their account and change the details, you’re more than welcome to what’s there, but it’s a shady way to secure someone’s gaming collection posthumously. In almost every scenario, the platform provider <strong>won’t </strong>transfer an account to another user or merge gaming libraries – which could ultimately mean that hundreds of games and thousands of dollars go to waste.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s terms suggest that when someone dies, their account and library are left to fade into the abyss. It’s a similar situation for Xbox users, but there are some suggestions online that talk about Nintendo being open to allowing an executor of an estate access to digital profiles. </p>



<p>The long and short of it is that users should find some way to make their account details known before they pass – if that’s at all possible. If not, there doesn’t seem to be any legal basis that requires providers to open up their accounts to next of kin or any family members or close friends. In this increasingly technical world, it’s not <strong>that </strong>uncommon to see people leaving their digital treasures to those they bid farewell to when they leave this mortal plane.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23940888/godzilla-minus-one-review-digital-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="oZ88Ao"><small>This review of </small><small><em>Godzilla Minus One </em></small><small>was originally posted in conjunction with the movie’s theatrical release. It has been updated and reposted now that the film is available on digital platforms.</small></p>
<p id="EtSW6T"><em>Godzilla Minus One</em> is the throwback movie that longtime Godzilla fans have been waiting for. This is an age of abundance for Godzilla media: Over the past seven years, as part of a partnership between Toho and Hollywood studios, the giant lizard received three animated films on Netflix, two U.S. movies, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906907/godzilla-apple-tv-show-monarch-monsters-review">an Apple TV series that premieres Nov. 17</a>. Godzilla fans like me haven’t been left wanting. And yet something crucial has been missing from most of this media, something fundamental to the earliest films in the Godzilla franchise: terror. </p>
<p id="O2W3x0">We nearly had a decade of terrifying Godzilla. In 2016, Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi released<em> </em>the horrifying <em>Shin Godzilla</em>, widely regarded as one of the best entries in the franchise. It promised a return to the petrifying, humanity-destroying Godzilla of the past. But <em>Shin Godzilla</em> marked a lengthy hiatus in the production of Japanese live-action Godzilla films, and signaled the beginning of a colossally successful American era for the big lizard. The American Godzilla media of the past seven years, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/7/18648048/godzilla-king-of-monsters-post-credits-ending-kong-woolly-mammoth-interview"><em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22356658/godzilla-vs-kong-review"><em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em></a>, and those Netflix anime movies, ranges from serviceable to pretty damn good, though its creators borrowed far more from the Marvel Cinematic Universe than from classic kaiju matinees. </p>

<p id="YtT0PU">After years of letting Hollywood take its contractually mandated turn, Toho returns with a literal throwback movie that lands Godzilla nearly a century in the past. He doesn’t have any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_Godzilla">adorable friends</a> in this new Japanese-produced live-action period piece. You won’t see him save Tokyo from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedorah">kaiju that represents oceanic pollution</a>, or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoC3IuB_Au0">reptilian mech that embodies capitalism</a> gone awry. Nor will you <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22356658/godzilla-vs-kong-review">spot King Kong</a> or hear mention of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906907/godzilla-apple-tv-show-monarch-monsters-review">the Monsterverse</a>.</p>
<p id="ItgbCu">Instead, <em>Godzilla Minus One </em>sticks to the original recipe. The movie that kicked it all off, 1954’s <em>Godzilla, </em>mixes horror, classic melodrama, and a feverish anti-war message to mine the anxieties of ’50s Japan. <em>Minus One</em> goes even further into the past, with a story set in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Writer-director Takashi Yamazaki (who took another beloved franchise back to basics with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/11/3/21546514/lupin-iii-the-first-movie-review-hayao-miyazaki-castle-of-cagliostro"><em>Lupin III: The First</em></a>)<em> </em>imagines how a Japan with no military, no economy, and no international support would respond to Godzilla’s first attack. </p>
<p id="BBcWvR">So is this a reboot? A remake? A reimagining? A bit of all of the above.</p>
<div id="3yyOGZ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7DqccP1Q_4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1CXuWC">Our reluctant hero is Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who, in the waning hours of the war, faked a plane malfunction to escape death. In a Godzilla film, the giant monsters typically carry the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/05/godzilla-meaning-monster-metaphors.html">central political metaphor</a>, but in <em>Minus One</em>, Koichi shoulders that burden on his tiny human frame. As a kamikaze pilot who survived the war, he returns to his neighborhood to find that little remains beyond rubble and a few surviving neighbors.</p>
<p id="seIKOq">This is ground-level Godzilla storytelling: We see the events through the eyes of Koichi, his neighbors, and his co-workers, rather than through knowledgeable government leaders, superhuman soldiers, or Godzilla himself. As with any great kaiju film, we spend much of the film’s first half learning to care about these lovable folks just before their world gets obliterated by hundreds of tons of giant lizard.</p>
<p id="mkRhKp">Koichi is an unusually grim lead, even by the standards of the more somber early Godzilla films. He despises himself for his decision to bail on his kamikaze mission, and his neighbors, who’ve lost their homes and families, aren’t especially thrilled to see him either. Nonetheless, together they rebuild from bombed-out blocks to bivouacked shacks, and eventually to modest homes that cluster among the suburban Tokyo sprawl. Considering this a Godzilla movie, it’s like watching people rebuilding their lives with a giant box of dominoes.</p>

</p>
<p id="53AR5H"><em>Minus One</em> isn’t a period piece in aesthetic alone: The story itself feels like something preserved from the 1950s. Yamazaki steeps it in the melodrama of a classic historical epic. His characters are capital-R Romantic, constantly making bold proclamations and grand sacrifices, discussing heavy topics where modern characters would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P05deS1h6oM">quip about shawarma</a>. </p>
<p id="UKCBWc">Koichi and his companions debate the power of nonviolence, the value of self-preservation, and the unjust expectations governments put upon their populations in times of war. The latter point makes <em>Godzilla Minus One </em>a surprisingly potent pairing with Hayao Miyazaki’s animated semi-biopic<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/30/21275291/the-wind-rises-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-hbo-max"><em>The Wind Rises</em></a>, and a timely response to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/01/02/national/japan-sdf-recruitment-problems/">Japan’s current military buildup</a>.</p>
<p id="Jkm7x0">Of course, it’s precisely when Koichi and company begin to open their hearts and get their feet on the ground that Godzilla arrives. (Technically, he appears earlier in the film, but I’ll spare you the spoilers.) When Godzilla makes his first legitimate impression, he strikes like a 2023 version of the original Godzilla: the living manifestation of nuclear terror. His initial physical destruction is dwarfed by his heat ray, which, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23855460/godzilla-minus-one-trailer-release-date">as shown in the trailer</a>, leaves behind little more than a crater and a mushroom cloud.</p>

<p id="GfwhSr">This is the moment in modern Godzilla movies where the heroes send in mechs, a rival kaiju, or some cutting-edge military aircraft. But <em>Minus One</em>, to its credit, sticks to the original formula, using historical reality to wave away any easy solutions. Most of Japan’s military has been decommissioned following its surrender to the U.S., its remaining warships sent away for disassembly. The U.S. government won’t help, either; its government is afraid to move weaponry into the region, which might provoke an anxious Soviet Union. So there’s only one group left to stop Godzilla: the civilian population. It’s a legitimately terrifying prospect — a group of average people versus a kaiju.</p>
<p id="2I9j0Z">For those of us under the age of 70, conceptualizing Godzilla as a genuinely frightening horror monster can be a challenge. Hell, he appears in an upcoming <a href="https://amazon.com/Love-Godzilla-Olivia-Luchini/dp/0593661443?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://amazon.com/Love-Godzilla-Olivia-Luchini/dp/0593661443?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23704929__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23704929__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">children’s book that espouses the power of love</a>. But in 1954, Godzilla terrified audiences across the globe, as a metaphor for nuclear weapons’ imprecise, passionless ability to level whole cities.</p>
<p id="yKfXfa">In its back half, <em>Minus One</em> recreates that style of terror with human stakes and an intensely political message. Yamazaki brings together the threads he carefully put in place: Koichi’s mental health, the barely rebuilt Japan, the absent government, the abandoned military, and, in true classic melodrama fashion, a love story. Then he pits them against an indifferent, catastrophic force.</p>

<p id="aHRpiL">Is Godzilla the threat of nuclear weaponry? The temptation to respond to violence with greater violence? An indifferent American military in a period of national rebuild? The fact that<em> Godzilla Minus One</em> prompts these questions underscores what modern Godzilla media has been missing.</p>
<p id="beu9UY">Don’t get me wrong; I’ve enjoyed the near-decade of Godzilla entertainment in America. But as someone who has <em>Shin Godzilla </em>at the top of<em> </em>his Godzilla tier list, who introduced his child to Mothra at far too young an age, and has a Hedorah anatomy poster sitting behind him at this very moment, this is the Godzilla I’ve been waiting for. </p>
<p id="Z8VTz4">Godzilla films provide filmmakers a precious opportunity to tell political stories not just about individuals, but about communities, or even entire nations. And because Godzilla movies will always feature a kaiju destroying famous cities and landmarks like a toddler let loose in a Lego museum, people will show up. It’s a fantastic entertainment vessel for big ideas. For years now, Godzilla has been giving us plenty of sugar. But considering the state of the world, I’m glad he’s once again showing up with a bit of medicine, too. </p>

The set will cost $89.99 in the US when it’s released on August 1st.</p><p>Lego says the set will include “familiar biomes, favorite mobs and hidden Easter eggs.” As the name suggests, the kit looks like an in-game crafting table.

            <p>I haven't played Bloodborne and so references to its world or characters mean little to me. Kart racers, meanwhile? There I'm in my element due to a lifetime of Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed. It's those games that make me interested in Nightmare Kart, a PSX-aesthetic racing game which was formerly known as Bloodborne Kart, and which is out now.

<figcaption>Nightmare Kart launch trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYv0Ce4Be2I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The free game includes 21 racers, 13 karts, 15 tracks and split screen multiplayer. More unusually, it also has a full campaign mode "with boss fights".
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, you can <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/nmkart">download Nightmare Kart from Itch.io</a> by naming your own price. It'll also be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930160/Nightmare_Kart/">via Steam</a> "once the game is out of build review jail."
</p>
<p>Nightmare Kart is from the makers of Bloodborne PSX, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-psx-is-a-smart-demake-of-a-fromsoft-classic">similarly styled demake</a> that maintains the third-person action of its inspiration. Its kart racing spin-off began life as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvDQGmCeiTk&amp;ab_channel=LilithWalther">an April Fool's joke during development</a>. Sort of. 'Bloodborne Kart' is also a long-running joke within the Bloodborne community more generally.
</p>
<p>The change to "Nightmare Kart", and the removal of other more direct references to the FromSoft game, was the result of the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-kart-will-scrub-the-branding-off-after-being-contacted-by-sonys-lawyers">being contacted by Sony's lawyers</a>. Will I miss those references? As mentioned above, I wouldn't recognise them whether they were there or not, but I'm glad I still get the opportunity to speed around some gothic horror race tracks.</p>

        <p>The may return from the wilderness one day, they say</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Turn-based tactical RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wildermyth">Wildermyth</a> is one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wildermyth-review">best games Sin has ever played</a>. It got a second DLC, Omenroad, which turned it into a roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/excellent-fantasy-rpg-wildermyth-is-turning-into-a-roguelike-via-dlc">earlier this month</a>.
</p>
<p>Omenroad turns out to be the end of the road, however, both for Wildermyth and - for now - for the team that made it, Worldwalker Games.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Active development on Wildermyth is complete. We will continue to support the game and fix critical bugs, but don't expect new content, going forward. We will be saying farewell to many of our team members. Worldwalker Games is going into hibernation for now," wrote studio co-owner Nate Austin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/763890/view/4151834437164418980">in an announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>The announcement isn't the result of Omenroad's sales performance, which is apparently "doing quite well". Instead, Austin says that they're "going into hibernation because we are done with this project."
</p>
<p>It sounds as if, while there's no timeline, this may not be the end of Worldwalker Games forever. "I'm pretty sure we'll eventually find something else to pour our passion into, and we'll let you know about it when the time comes."
</p>
<p>Austin elaborated on that thought, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wildermyth-developer-worldwalker-games-is-going-into-hibernation-not-because-it-has-to-but-because-it-wants-to-we-did-what-we-set-out-to-do/">telling PC Gamer</a> that "the only way we know how to [find a new project] is by going off into the metaphorical wilderness for a while." Austin also says that they're "not excited to make a Wildermyth sequel" after 11 years of working on the original.
</p>
<p>We spoke to the team at Worldwalker in 2022 to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-wildermyth-how-two-ex-riot-devs-and-a-college-grad-built-the-most-innovative-rpg-in-years">learn more about that eleven-year development process</a>.</p>

        <p>Flexible action-RPG launched in 2020</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It feels as if every action-RPG can be described in terms of its relationship to genre daddy Diablo. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolcen-lords-of-mayhem">Wolcen:Lords Of Mayhem</a>, for example, launched a few months after Diablo 4 was announced and helped to satiate some early click cravings. Briefly.
</p>
<p>Early positive sentiment was quickly scuppered by bugs, slow updates and more. Now its developers say that they're ending support for the game, and multiplayer functionality will be switched off this September.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Thank you for your unwavering support and dedication. We are fully aware of the challenges that have emerged from the early technical decisions made regarding the game's architecture, challenges that are insurmountable without a complete technology overhaul," says the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/424370/view/4187863234164885744">announcement regarding the future of the game</a>.
</p>
<p>"We have diligently updated Wolcen, enhancing every facet of the game from introducing new chapters and items to improving UI, animations, and the meticulous balancing of skills, items, and gameplay, alongside technical enhancements. Despite these efforts and the team's dedication behind our patches, we've encountered foundational hurdles that prevent further improvements under the existing framework.
</p>
<p>"It is with a heavy heart that we announce a significant change: Starting September 3, 2024, Wolcen will no longer support multiplayer functionality. Additionally, we will cease further development and support for the game."
</p>
<p>Wolcen Studio say ending development will allow them to "focus on new projects", where they can apply the lessons they learned from working on Wolcen. Wolcen: Lords Of Mayhem will remain playable in singleplayer and its price will be permanently reduced to reflect the loss of functionality.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hellboy-video-games-ranked-the-good-the-bad-and-the-wyrd.887364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hellboy-video-games-ranked-the-good-the-bad-and-the-wyrd/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hellboy-video-games-ranked-the-good-the-bad-and-the-wyrd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In 2024, one of the most popular and recognizable non-Marvel or DC Comics creations turned 30: Hellboy. Yes, the Dark Horse Comics staple has been around for three decades now, having appeared in some truly remarkable print stories along the way. Of course, given his icon status, it’s no surprise that Anung Un Rama has transcended the comic book medium on numerous occasions.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Since his first wide-release story, 1994’s <em>Seed of Destruction</em>, Hellboy has tried out numerous mediums. He’s a merchandise mover with plenty of t-shirts, action figures, and posters to show for it. He has popped up at the movies three times, with Ron Perlman and David Harbour taking him on. Hellboy has even made the jump to animation. Not to mention, he has also cracked paranormal cases in the video game realm.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">To say Hellboy’s gaming tenure has been a mixed bag would be an understatement. While his guest appearances in <em>Injustice 2</em> and <em>Brawlhalla</em> were fun, his dedicated titles have proven less so. Here they all are, ranked from worst to relative best.</p>  <figure data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via AppSpy</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-tooth-fairy-terror" data-injectable="false">5. Hellboy II: The Golden Army – Tooth Fairy Terror</h2> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Following the success of <em>Hellboy</em> in 2004, director Guillermo del Toro released <em>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</em> in 2008. Ultimately, it failed to reach the heights of its predecessor, but the cast, production design, and story are all pretty strong. However, the same cannot be said for its shoddy mobile game tie-in, Tuesday Creatives’ <em>Hellboy II: The Golden Army – Tooth Fairy Terror</em>.</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">Released in December 2008, <em>Tooth Fairy Terror</em> was available on the Apple App Store for free, and it’s not hard to figure out why. As the terrifying tooth fairies from the film fly toward you, you have to tap on them to “shoot” them. To reload, shake your screen, then get back to defending yourself. Survive as long as you can and rack up as high of a score as possible. </p>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">There’s not much more to it than that. <em>Tooth Fairy Terror </em>is basic, boring, and entirely skippable for even the most dedicated Hellboy fans.</p>  <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-hellboy-dogs-of-the-night-hellboy-asylum-seeker" data-injectable="false">4. Hellboy: Dogs of the Night/Hellboy: Asylum Seeker</h2> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true"><em>Hellboy: Dogs of the Night</em> was originally developed for PC back in 2000, later moving to the PlayStation in 2003 under the new title <em>Hellboy: Asylum Seeker</em>. The fact that this is the very first Hellboy-centric video game ever, and that it seems some amount of effort was made to translate the source material into a video game, is about all that this dual-titled Cryo Studios effort has going for it. </p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><em>Asylum Seeker</em>/<em>Dogs of the Night</em> has players control Hellboy (David Gasman) himself as he investigates the disappearance of one of his fellow Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense agents. He uses his fists (typically just his regular one, not the massive stone one) and his revolver to fend off enemies, slowly wandering around various environments to piece together what happened to his friend.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">All in all, this game is slow, the combat of the tank-control-bound Hellboy feels hollow at best, and the graphics are hideous, even for the era. There’s some amount of reverence for the <em>Hellboy</em> comics here in the design and story, but the execution is a big swing and a miss.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via IGN</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-hellboy-the-stench-of-evil" data-injectable="false">3. Hellboy: The Stench of Evil</h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Going back to the realm of mobile games, we come to another game meant to drum up hype for <em>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</em>, as well as tie into another soon-to-be-mentioned Hellboy game. This time around, it’s G5 Entertainment’s <em>Hellboy: The Stench of Evil</em>, which was released on July 10, 2008 and brings the title character into the exciting world of action platforming. The problem is, this game isn’t very exciting.</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><em>The Stench of Evil</em> is a pretty bare-bones platformer. Hellboy runs and jumps through a few different environments, plowing through enemies with ease. If you take enough punishment to fill up the rage meter, your attacks do even more damage. For a mobile game, the visuals are decent, with fairly detailed environments and plenty of color.</p> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">On the whole,<em> Hellboy: The Stench of Evil </em>isn’t horrifically bad, nor is it particularly good. It’s a middle-of-the-road promotional game and nothing more.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via IGN</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-hellboy-the-science-of-evil" data-injectable="false">2. Hellboy: The Science of Evil</h2> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">After spending some time away from the console scene, Hellboy and his companions made their grand return in 2008. <em>Hellboy: The Science of Evil</em> brings the del Toro <em>Hellboy</em> universe to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PSP, complete with Perlman back as Big Red, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien — all three being playable, no less. They unite to defeat the evil Herman von Klempt (Jürgen Prochnow) and his forces.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Compared to the previous three games, <em>The Science of Evil</em> is a huge step forward, but it’s still not great. The design, voice acting, combat, and story can’t quite make up for the somewhat lacking graphics and uninspired gameplay. With a bit more polish and development, <em>The Science of Evil </em>could’ve been the Hellboy adventure gamers had wanted for years.</p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">It has also been said that Lobster Johnson, voiced by the legendary Bruce Campbell, was slated for a DLC release, only for such content to be canned. This is just another example of <em>The Science of Evil</em> coming so close to greatness just to end up missing the mark.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-hellboy-web-of-wyrd" data-injectable="false">1. Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</h2> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">Well over a decade after receiving his own dedicated game, Hellboy returned to the gaming forefront in 2023 via <em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>. It’s not using a movie franchise as its basis, nor is it designed to promote something else. It’s just a Hellboy tale, in the aesthetic of the <em>Hellboy</em> comics, with Dark Horse and Mignola directly involved. But, how well does it all come together?</p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><em>Web of Wyrd</em> is undeniably the most beautiful Hellboy-centric game to date, appearing as a comic come to life. The late, great Lance Reddick makes for an excellent Hellboy, who’s looking for a missing BPRD agent through a dimension called the Wyrd. Unfortunately, the combat in this <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-difference-between-roguelike-and-roguelite-games/">roguelike (not to be confused with roguelite)</a> title leaves much to be desired, resulting in much of the gameplay feeling dull and repetitive.</p>
 <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">With 30 years behind him, evidently, Hellboy has yet to receive a truly definitive video game adaptation. Hopefully, at some point in the next 30, that game will come along.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-is-asobi%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98biggest-game-ever%E2%80%99-with-150-playstation-cameos.887355/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Team Asobi has clarified that Astro Bot is the company’s biggest game ever, boasting an ambitious scope that incorporates cameos from around 150 iconic PlayStation characters. Releasing in time to celebrate PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, Astro Bot is a full-fledged platformer that’s drenched in Sony-themed goodness, featuring 80 levels that give players ‘a renewed experience every 10 minutes or so.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-blasting-off">Astro Bot Blasting Off</h2>



<p>On September 6, Astro Bot will be released exclusively on PlayStation 5. It’s one of the most highly anticipated games that was shown at the recent State of Play event, which elsewhere was fairly lacklustre and didn’t hit too much of a mark with the community. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://ew.com/astro-bot-2024-game-playstation-cameos-exclusive-8655347">a recent interview</a>, Team Asobi’s Nicolas Doucet spoke at length about Astro Bot, revealing how in-depth and expansive a game it’ll be:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to make a big game. This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro’s big story. We call it&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>&nbsp;because we treat this as a new beginning. That’s a really, really big game. I think for us, that’s the biggest game we’ve ever made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the first Astro title was a free bolt-on that came with the PlayStation 5 console, Astro Bot is a premium release with plenty of content to explore. In some ways, Astro Bot has been touted as a ‘reunion’ for some of PlayStation’s most iconic characters. With a roster of 150 cameos being lined up, it seems impossible that any PS-based personality from the last thirty years will have been missed. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-gone-director-sony-execs-%E2%80%98were-never-fans%E2%80%99-hence-no-sequel.887352/</guid>

<p>Ahead of the recent State of Play showcase that revealed upcoming games for the PlayStation ecosystem, Jeff Ross, who worked as the game director on Days Gone, made a damning statement. On the subject of Days Gone 2 making an appearance at a PlayStation showcase, Ross explained that Sony executives, like the newly crowned CEO Hermen Hulst, ‘were never fans’, insinuating that’s a core reason why a follow-up title was never developed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-days-gone-by">Days Gone By</h2>



<p>Days Gone was a solid enough post-apocalyptic title with plenty of meat on the bones, but thanks to a launch that was plagued with issues, it drew negative feedback very early on, marring the game considerably. From the veteran team at Bend Studio, Days Gone emerged as something quite new and tasty in the zombie-slasher world, presenting players with motorbiking badass, Deacon St John, in a world torn apart and ripe for the plucking.</p>



<p>In a post published on social media before the recent State of Play showcase, Jeff Ross, one of the senior team members who worked on Days Gone, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen. Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were hopeful in the comments but Jeff Ross shut down one particular poster by writing, ‘This is a case of cancelled for now versus cancelled forever.’ It’s sad news for those who enjoyed Days Gone – like myself – but it was a one-shot wonder that won’t ever see the light of day again.</p>

            <p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will debut on Netflix on 10th October, 2024.</p>
<p>The streaming giant confirmed the news earlier today with an all-too-brief teaser – I'm afraid it's less than a minute long – which you can see embedded below:</p>
<figure>

<p>The animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft "picks up after the events of the highly successful Tomb Raider video game Survivor trilogy (Tomb Raider; Rise of the Tomb Raider; Shadow of the Tomb Raider), and will chart the globetrotting heroine’s next chapter as the iconic adventurer", Netflix explains.</p>

<p data-characters="457" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the third and final season of <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em> and the miniseries <em>Tales of the Empire</em> now firmly in the rearview mirror, the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise is revving up for yet another new addition. The first live-action series in some time, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-release-date-poster-cast-and-more/">Star Wars: The Acolyte</a> </em>aims to take viewers back in time. Long before the Empire, long before the Clone Wars, there was the Jedi Order, the Republic, and a mysterious, powerful force seeking to destroy them both.</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false"><em>The Acolyte</em> takes audiences a century ahead of <em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em> as a group of Jedi attempt to sort out a criminal conspiracy. Jedi are being killed left and right and no one knows who is responsible. This intriguing tale comes from series creator and showrunner Leslye Headland, who’s no stranger to the Star Wars galaxy.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">In fact, Headland herself shared that her love of <em>Star Wars</em> helped her create <em>The Acolyte</em>. More specifically, her love and knowledge of <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs and the Expanded Universe influenced her creative direction. “I was coming at it as a fan who was much more into the RPG that the Extended Universe feeds on,” Headland said in an interview with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com./hollywood/2022/05/the-acolyte-star-wars-series">Vanity Fair</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">Continuing, Headland mentioned that <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs went a long way in helping her creativity come out as a kid. She didn’t feel the need to adhere strictly to what the films had to offer narratively, instead making her own fun in George Lucas’ massive sandbox. She brought that mentality to <em>The Acolyte</em>, affording her the chance to push the boundaries of <em>Star Wars</em> itself.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">“I was able to escape into that world with my friends, to pretend that I was part of that world. It was not like, ‘And now you have to do a scene from the original movie,’” she added, noting that, in her mind, there’s far more to <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling than strictly rehashing the core story elements, character arcs, and the like of the now-nine movie-long Skywalker saga.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Though Headland didn’t name any specific <em>Star Wars</em> games in her Vanity Fair interview, she did indirectly mention one game that helped lay the foundation of her <em>Acolyte</em> vision elsewhere. She told <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-wars-the-acolyte-shows-us-a-side-of-the-sith-weve-never-seen-before/">Den of Geek</a>, “Darth Traya really stuck out to me as an inspiration.” Traya (Sara Kestelman), formerly the Jedi Kreia, is a major player in the 2004 hit RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/better-with-age-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, fans don’t have to wait too long to see where specifically Headland’s enduring love for <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs manifests in her show. <em>The Acolyte</em> premieres on June 4 exclusively on Disney+.</p>
