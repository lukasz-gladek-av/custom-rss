			<p>A couple of months ago, independent developer <strong>Chaos Manufacturing</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/sol-shogunate-samurai-space-opera-action-rpg-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its debut game</a>, a sci-fi action roleplaying game titled <strong>SOL Shogunate</strong>. The game is quite different from your average science fiction setting: the developers describe it as a "<strong>samurai space opera</strong>". Essentially, the developers have imagined an alternate future in which humanity has colonized the Solar System, but <strong>society has somehow retained feudal Japanese culture</strong>. The game takes place primarily on the Moon, where the way of the sword is law under the rule of a powerful Shogunate.</p>



<p>The Moon features artificial gravity-creating cities, <strong>each designed as an homage to a revered era of Japanese history</strong>. These gleaming metropolises showcase towering space elevators, bullet trains, and opulent districts where the shogunate elite enjoy Earthlike comforts, including simulated night cycles. However, beneath the glittering surface lies a darker reality: <strong>countless workers quietly live and die in service to the Shogunate</strong>. Players control <strong>Yuzuki</strong>, the sole surviving heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. After her family's destruction, she becomes an outlaw ronin and embarks on a blood-soaked path of vengeance through the lunar cities.</p>



<p>The developer, Chaos Manufacturing, places great importance on music for this project. The studio already announced collaborations with various artists, including Japanese rock band <strong>AliA</strong>. Following the unveiling, I reached out through PR and set up an interview with the founders, <strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong> (Game Director) and <strong>Guy Constantini</strong> (CEO), both of whom have extensive experience developing triple-A games. </p>



<p>It was a very intriguing conversation that made me even more interested in SOL Shogunate than I already was. As a reminder, <strong>the game is in early development</strong> for PC (you can already wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>) and consoles. It may take a few years before we can play it, especially since the team is very small.</p>

<h2 id="aaa-indie-origins">From AAA to Indie - The Origins of Chaos Manufacturing</h2>



<p><strong>Welcome! Tell us about your respective backgrounds.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Leszek Szczepański:</strong> Sure. Hi, my name is Leszek Szczepański. I'm the Game Director at Chaos Manufacturing, which effectively means I drive the development effort. I gather a lot of talented and creative people and direct them in a way that helps us create this game. I've been in games for approaching 18 years. I'm Polish and worked in games in Poland for five years initially. Back in the day, I worked on mobile versions of <em>Metal Gear</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>, among others. After five years, I wanted to do bigger games. I looked around Europe and found Guerrilla Games in the Netherlands, part of PlayStation.</p>



<p>There, <strong>I worked on <em>Killzone Shadow Fall</em>, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> almost from the beginning, and <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></strong>. Over this time, I’ve been an engineer, a designer, managed a few gaming projects, and used to be a professional Dungeon Master. After all this, I realized it was time to build something of my own. Around that time, I got introduced to Guy. I realized he is the yin to my yang; we complement each other quite well, so we decided to get Chaos going together about two years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I’m Guy Constantini. I am the General Manager and CEO (or "wrangler of cats") at Chaos Manufacturing. I make sure that if there's something that needs to be done, there is either a person to do it, or I have to do it myself. We met a couple of years ago and have been working on this ever since. I grew up in Milano and Monza, where my dad brought home an Atari 2600, which tells you how old I am. From there, I decided I needed to make my way to the States. I studied in New Jersey at Rutgers, but none of my initial jobs on the East Coast were in games. I realized I needed to get into the industry, so I moved to the West Coast and found this company called Riot Games. At the time, they were working on a little indie game called <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>



<p>I worked on that for a bit, then went to Kabam in San Francisco to work on <em>Marvel Contest of Champions</em>. I realized I didn't want to work in mobile games, so I came back down to Los Angeles to work for CD Projekt Red. <strong>I split my time between LA and Warsaw during the tail end of <em>The Witcher 3</em> and the beginning of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong>. From there, I went to Skydance Interactive and worked on <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</em> (Chapter 1 and 2) and <em>Behemoth</em>.</p>



<p>Eventually, I realized I had brought games to every platform currently in use. I decided to see if I could start my own company and make the games I finally wanted to make for the rest of my life. I knew I needed a competent Game Director because, while I know how to build projects, I don't know how to build a game from scratch myself. </p>



<p><strong>You both have impressive credits. Guerrilla Games and CD Projekt Red are basically as AAA as it gets. Tell us more about Chaos Manufacturing. What kind of company did you envision, and how big is it? Is it remote or hybrid?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We learned a lot of lessons working on big and small projects. We always wanted to build something tight that punched above its weight. The idea was to find the right people because we think that if we do this correctly, those people will have wonderful lives.</p>



<p>Obviously, you have to have a concept for a company and cool games, but really, it's about the philosophy that drives us. We embrace the "chaos" of game development. I put it in the title so that if things ever feel frayed at the edges, we can point to the name!</p>



<p>We wanted to find autodidacts with a passion for knowledge. People who pursue mastery on their own. In a startup, you have to do things you're great at and things that simply need to be done. In exchange for this massive autonomy, we wanted to give people something worthwhile. Everyone in the company has at least a piece of what we're building. Eventually, once equity stops mattering, it'll be profit sharing. The idea is that people making the game should partake in the results of their success.</p>



<p><strong>We also wanted to give people ultimate flexibility. We don't want you to move across the ocean just to see if something works out. That's why right now we're pretty much remote</strong>. The intent isn't to be remote for the sake of it, but to ask the people how they want to work together and have the company adjust to them. A company is a group of people, so the people should inform how the company functions. We think that is a more sustainable way of building a business.</p>



<p><strong>We've been up to five people full-time, and that number fluctuates depending on where we are in our go-to-market path. We have a constellation of fractional people helping us out.</strong> One of my pet peeves is when people say, "This was a one-man job." It never really is. We will always credit the people involved. At the very core, I just want to treat people the way I want to be treated.</p>



<p><strong>Are you self-funded? I know it's a tough environment for the industry right now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I joke that I picked the best and worst time to do this. I have learned a lot about how tough fundraising is. Everything we've raised so far has been from angels—small checks cobbled together to build things. We definitely have some financing partners that have come to the table recently.</p>



<p>Our approach has always been: find the right partners, raise the money we can, and build responsibly with that money. Our model allows us to only grow as much as we need. <strong>We could always use more funding, but I’d rather not start than take money from the wrong people</strong> and end up in a situation where we grow too much, things go wrong, and people are out of a job.</p>



<p><strong>Is the goal to self-publish, or would you consider a publisher?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> I am very open to financing partners of various sorts. I know how to build a publisher; I've done so before efficiently. However, some publishers have capabilities I don't have. For the right partner, we are flexible, provided we retain creative control and they bring something to the table we lack. <strong>We don't have a publisher involved yet, but we are open to it depending on the partner</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="creating-samurai-space-opera">SOL Shogunate: Creating a "Samurai Space Opera"</h2>



<p><strong>Moving on to the game, SOL Shogunate. The setting is quite interesting; space opera isn't usually connected to samurai. How did that idea come about?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The act of creation is inherently selfish. To create anything of value, you need to really believe in it, and to do that, you use the things you are passionate about. We looked at what we love: hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, near-future sci-fi, samurai fiction, Japanese music, and anime. We took these fascinations and put them together into a coherent whole. SOL Shogunate is what we call a "Samurai Space Opera," a mix of all these things we are passionate about.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We wanted to find a space that hadn't been explored a ton. <strong>We’ve seen samurai fiction and sci-fi alt-futures, but we wanted to architect a surreal future that feels fresh. We wanted to surprise people with the mix we put together.</strong></p>



<p>Originally, the idea came from a piece of concept art by a wonderful artist who works with us, <strong>Aaron Nakahara</strong> (Kobaltplasma). He had this stylized image of a warrior who looked like a traditional samurai but had a burning light in the middle of his face. It reminded me of times we've seen samurai or ninja aesthetics in the future where it felt like just a coat of paint. I wanted to build something with an intentional aesthetic that came from a specific reason.</p>



<p><strong>The protagonist, Yuzuki, is an outlaw out for revenge, which is a bit common nowadays. How do you plan to make her stand out compared to the average Ronin?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Honestly, the revenge part is just the first domino to fall. The story is not typical samurai fiction; it’s about unraveling mysteries regarding creation and destruction. The tragedy sets you on a path, but that path takes you to unexpected places.</p>



<p>Secondly, there is a reason we put Yuzuki in the future on the moon. She is a future samurai. The way she moves, fights, and looks is different. She has a sword, but also a thruster pack and grappling hooks, fighting in low gravity. We asked ourselves: "What is a future space samurai on the moon?"</p>



<p>Also, the idea of genetic modification is deeply ingrained in the story and setting. <strong>Yuzuki has unique genetic modifications. Her armor is inspired by samurai armor, but it's also part of her genetic augments that allow her to survive in the vacuum of space.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> If you read <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, you know that to be a samurai means to become the ultimate warrior. We wanted to ask: what does someone who idolizes this ethos do when they have access to technology 200 years in the future, like personal jetpacks and bioceramic skin? What does that do to the ultimate warrior? We carved out a character that behaves differently from a warrior in feudal Japan or a standard sci-fi soldier.</p>



<p><b>Does she have ranged capabilities, or is she meant to be a melee-only character?</b></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: The vast majority of her skills are based around melee weapons. <strong>She has grappling hooks to close the distance quickly</strong>. Through our upgrade system, she will unlock certain additional abilities, some of which might work at a distance, but ultimately these are there to enhance her fighting capabilities.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/211025_SolShogunate_ChaosManufacturing_Screenshot1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="gameplay-deep-dive">Gameplay Deep Dive - Music-Synced Battles and Genetic Upgrades</h2>



<p><strong>You mentioned unlocking skills. How does progression work in SOL Shogunate? Are there levels?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: We have two elements of character progression. The simpler one is finding different weapons and unlocking armors as the story progresses. The major element is our genetic upgrade system.</p>



<p><strong>We don't have a typical skill tree. Throughout the game, Yuzuki collects "Gene Slices" by defeating enemies or finding them in the environment.</strong> These connect to specific abilities or passive buffs. You equip these on a "Gene Board." Depending on how they are placed, they might interact with each other to unlock new abilities. You can also mutate genes together to create new combinations.</p>



<p>Realistically, every playthrough will be a little different regarding the skills and upgrades the player discovers. This feeds not only into combat but also into how she interacts with the world and the story.</p>



<p><strong>Can you respec these mutations, or are they permanent?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: You can reorganize your Gene Board at almost any point. However, once you mutate two genes to create a new one, the original two are consumed and gone.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>The intent is that you have to make decisions that can't be reversed</strong>, but there is a lot of flexibility in how you rearrange your build.</p>



<p><strong>One of the main official features is the multi-phase boss fights. You mentioned they are cinematic but dynamic. How do you plan to make them exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Calling them just "boss fights" isn't precise; we think of them as epic set pieces. <strong>Some will be boss fights, but others might be elaborate encounters with multiple enemies.</strong> We treat these set pieces as puzzles; you need to figure out what tools you have and how to utilize them, similar to <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p>



<p>Since SOL Shogunate is a samurai space opera, music is fundamental. We are working with a number of Japanese rock bands to create specific music pieces for these encounters. A good song tells a story, and so does a good encounter. We want to synchronize them perfectly.</p>



<p>The music flows and evolves: intro, chorus, bridge. We ensure the encounter evolves exactly on the beat of the song. If a boss changes phases, it happens on the beat, and the music adds layers, like a choir or orchestra. I call it an "overwhelming cocktail of emotions," where the player is overwhelmed by what they see, hear, and interact with.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be difficulty levels so that players can customize the level of challenge in SOL Shogunate?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes. Our aim is to make a game that requires effort to finish, without overwhelming everyone. If you are a casual player, there will be an easy difficulty. If you want a proper challenge, there will be a hard mode.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>For those looking for a challenge, the harder difficulties will require you to really dig for ways to overcome enemies</strong>. Our systems are interlocking; once you understand them, you become stronger. I personally like games that "beat my face into the ground," so there will be something for that type of gamer.</p>



<p><strong>Regarding the narrative and space opera aspects, how are you tackling exposition and world-building?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: SOL Shogunate is a Japanese-style Action RPG, so we focus on strong characters and a vibrant world. We want to create the Moon (and maybe something larger later) full of life, factions, and people with their own stories. We want an intricate story with mysteries, misdirection, and puzzles, set in a rich world with conflicting truths.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> The premise, a samurai caste in charge of humanity, is just the tip of the iceberg. You have large rotating city biomes inside the moon with simulated gravity connected by train lines. Outside is the dangerous lunar surface with remnants of a solar system-wide war.</p>



<p><strong>The story is about two characters. Yuzuki is the primary playable character, but it’s a story of two people from different walks of life whose worldviews are shattered and pieced back together</strong>. Yuzuki’s skin is reminiscent of <em>Kintsugi</em> (repairing pottery with gold) because she is the "shattered heir" rebuilding herself. We believe in storytelling through gameplay, including artifacts, radio comms, and cinematics.</p>



<p><strong>Just to clarify, only Yuzuki is playable?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, correct.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate on the scope? 15-20 hours, maybe?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We aren't ready to talk about specific length or pricing yet, but philosophically, <strong>we think the world wants quality over quantity</strong>. Everyone has a stack of unplayed games that are hundreds of hours long. We want strong gameplay quality and visual fidelity that respects your time and wallet. It will definitely be beyond 10 hours, priced generously.</p>

<h2 id="tech-philosophy-stance-AI">Tech &amp; Philosophy - Unreal Engine 5 and the Studio's Stance on AI</h2>



<p><strong>Are you talking about a launch on next-gen consoles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> We want people on all kinds of devices to play. We are definitely coming to PC and Console. We’re developing controller-first, but PC will have a strong keyboard configuration. We want to build something tight, like <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, and if players want more, we’ll make <em>Arkham City</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Yes, it’s not a secret that we are working on Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed the Steam page previously had minimum requirements like a GTX 970, which seemed way too low.</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Leszek Szczepański</strong>: Apologies, that was an error. We removed them. We aren't at a stage to talk about target requirements yet.</p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> That was my fault! But generally, we want to make games that run on a wide range of hardware, though obviously, they will look incredible on the latest gear.</p>



<p><strong>A bonus question about the recent controversy with Larian regarding AI usage. What is your stance on AI?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Guy Constantini:</strong> <strong>Our game art is handcrafted</strong>. Our principal concept artist went couch surfing all over Japan to take pictures to build worlds inspired by real life. I like to let artists inform what tools they use, not tell them to use something just to save a buck. So far, our artists say making things by hand works best.</p>



<p>That said, anyone who says they know what they’ll be doing in two years is lying. Technology changes. If a new tool is great and artists love it, no problem. But right now, we prioritize the handcrafted approach.</p>



<p><strong>Nice. Well, thank you both for the lovely chat.</strong></p>

              <p>This year’s Winter Olympics have been some of the coolest to watch, thanks to some talented drone operators providing viewers at home and online with awesome shots of some of the Games’ fastest events.</p> <p>Drones with cameras have been used to record sporting events for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wYFdh1w_n6M">But due to a dangerous near-miss incident in 2015</a>, drones have basically been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/sports/skiing/drones-banned-at-world-cup-races-after-one-nearly-hits-marcel-hirscher.html">banned from most skiing and snowboarding events for years</a>. However, the tech has come a long way since that moment, and drones are smaller, more reliable, and safer than ever before. So the tech is a big feature of this year’s Winter Olympics presentation on NBC and other affiliated networks. The end results are <a href="https://x.com/nascarcasm/status/2020269499879158039">truly stunning</a> to look at.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The greatest new use of tech for the Olympics is this drone view behind the women’s downhill skiers. The intensity and speed, can’t be grasped from any of the other cameras we’re used to. Excellent.</p> <p>Now give me that in Apple Vision Pro. <a href="https://t.co/EtqgTkeYFq">pic.twitter.com/EtqgTkeYFq</a></p> <p>— Lee Parayno (@leeparayno) <a href="https://twitter.com/leeparayno/status/2020713318475071563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You don’t really understand how fast these athletes are going when you see them from a static camera angle as they rush down a mountain or skate across ice. But when a drone is flying right behind them, keeping up, it provides an incredible new look at these turbo-charged winter sports. Like, look at how fast this snowboarder is flying down the mountain!</p>

These drones are also operated by skilled pilots who work alongside a dedicated technician and director to ensure the athletes’ safety while capturing these jaw-dropping views.</p> <p>“When a camera is chasing the athlete down the hill — right in front of them or right behind them — you truly get the sense of how fast they’re going,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2026/02/09/drones-winter-olympics/">said Michael Sheehan, the coordinating director for NBC’s Olympic coverage</a>. “That’s virtually impossible to capture with a wide shot shooting from the side. The drone coverage takes us to a place we’ve traditionally never been.”</p>

 <p>All I can think about while looking at these clips of drones speeding behind athletes is: I want sports games that look like this, please!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, is getting a major update tomorrow (1.0.2) that will introduce the long-awaited Escape from Duckov collaboration content. We still don’t know what that looks like, but it marks the first cross-game collaboration in a hot minute for Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Battlestate announced an impending outage that will take Tarkov offline for up to six hours tomorrow, February 10.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-first-major-collaboration-is-coming">Tarkov’s First Major Collaboration is Coming</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, the teams at both Team Soda (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-duckov/" id="2714">Escape from Duckov</a>) and Battlestate Games (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a>) have been teasing a cross-platform collaboration. It promises to introduce crossover content in <strong>both games</strong>, despite the former title being a <strong>parody </strong>of the latter.</p>



<p>It looks like Escape from Tarkov’s maps will be replicated in Escape from Duckov, and the duck-themed characters from Duckov will surface <strong>in some way </strong>in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tomorrow, February 10 at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patch 1.0.2.0 for Escape from Tarkov. The installation will take between 4 and 6 hours, but may be extended if required. The game will be unavailable during this time.</p><p>The official websites… <a href="https://t.co/lkoojEGgyk">pic.twitter.com/lkoojEGgyk</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2020890440648573414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>We have no idea how long this collaboration is set to run for, but it’s likely to be a limited-time event that will expire after a few days. As with past Escape from Tarkov LTMs, it’s likely players will have achievements, items, and other rewards to unlock that, if they don’t get them now, they’ll never see them again.</p>



<p>You can expect Escape from Tarkov to be offline tomorrow from 7 AM GMT to at least 11 AM GMT, and <strong>most likely </strong>until 1 PM GMT. In true Tarkov style, you should also anticipate an extension to the maintenance window. To play it safe, perhaps wait until around 2 PM GMT for Escape from Tarkov to come back up.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/</link>
            <guid>1430449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" id="52298">Riot Games</a> has downsized the team working on its League of Legends-themed fighting game, 2XKO.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">A blog post on February 9</a>, which was written by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2xko/" id="1323">2XKO </a>executive producer Tom Cannon, revealed that the difficult decision to downsize the team was made in response to emerging trends. While the game has resonated with a core audience, momentum has stagnated, and Riot Games is unable to support a full-size team long-term.</p>



<p><span>A Riot Games spokesperson t</span>old <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>&nbsp;that approximately 80 staff members were laid off, about half of the development team.</p>



<p>The post states that, with the smaller, “focused” team, they will still make key improvements to the game, including items players have already requested. It is reiterated that this is a shift in how the development team will operate, not a sign that “the journey is over” for the 2XKO team.</p>



<p>“This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward,” Cannon wrote.</p>







<h2 id="h-riot-games-offering-support-to-laid-off-2xko-staff">Riot Games Offering Support to Laid-Off 2XKO Staff</h2>



<p>Furthermore, the blog noted that Riot Games will support staff through their transition, help them explore other opportunities within the company where possible, and provide at least 6 months of notice pay and severance where that’s not possible.</p>



<p>2XKO entered Early Access on PC on October 7, 2025, and launched across all platforms on January 20. Canon explained that during the console expansion, concerning player trends emerged. </p>



<p>Plans for the 2026 competitive series remain unchanged, and Riot will continue to focus on supporting events and organizers in local and broader communities.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, layoffs are currently a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft is undergoing a major restructuring, which has led to the cancellation of many projects, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">planned remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> and<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" id="174712"> a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed title.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to bring the latest updates on this story as more information becomes available.</p>

This is a difficult update to share, but we want to be clear about what’s changing and why.</p><p><strong>What’s Changing and Why</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the <em>2XKO</em> team.</p><p>I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.</p><p>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon.</p><p>Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities.

This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.</p><p><strong>About the People Behind the Game</strong></p><p>I want to be clear about something that matters deeply to me.</p><p>The people who helped ship <em>2XKO</em> poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful.</p><p>We’re committed to supporting impacted Rioters through this transition—including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of six months of notice pay and severance where it’s not.</p><p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p><p>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing.</p><p>In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the <em>2XKO</em> community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game.</p><p>Thank you for playing <em>2XKO</em>, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community.</p><p>—Tom Cannon</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/2xko-team-to-downsize-following-lackluster-launch]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The trick to most roguelites is your mastery of a particular deck or build. Whether it’s your cast of characters, deck of cards, or collection of spells, progress is gained as much from incremental additions as it is from your increased skill at playing that build. Chances are you’ve dedicated a huge amount of time to one specific build in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, or a preferred range of Jokers in&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, such that next time you head out you’re both better equipped and better acquainted to cope with the familiar path of enemies, challenges and incidents. <em>Mewgenics</em>, the latest game from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, responds to this format by saying, “What if we screwed that all up and threw it in the trash?” Oh, and added, “And threw in as much toilet humor as we possibly can?” The result, I’m delighted to report, is really rather impressive.</p> <p><em>Mewgenics</em> (out February 10 on Steam) is a <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style roguelite but with turn-based RPG-like battles played out on a small grid. For each run you take a group of four kitty-cats, each with their own roll of skill numbers, who are then assigned a class before the run begins. You then make your way through an ever-longer series of maps, each with battles, mystery situations, random treasures and boss fights, using your crew of cats and their somewhat randomly assigned sets of abilities, until you’ve figured out how to combine them as an incredibly effective team. Win the fights, defeat the most distant boss, and you’ll return to your home to, oh no, have all four of them (if they lived) retire. They’ll never fight again. All those skills you learned, the ways you figured out how to allow them to buff one another, a particular one-two combo you found to be especially effective? That’s gone now. Time to start over.</p>

 <p>That sounds rough, but the point is, you managed all those things, gained all that ability, on that single run. You can do it again, with four different cats with different skills, and perhaps different classes (you assign cats with specific class-granting collars before you begin, picking from, say, Mage, Thief, Fighter and Hunter, with more collars becoming available the more you play), and find a whole new way for a new crew to come together. Once. Of course, at the same time that you’re still gaining all the knowledge, you’re still getting better at the game, just not perhaps in the way that’s quite so familiar.</p>   <p>You get more cats, by the way, through the magic of nature. After picking two cats from a mad scientist, leaving them alone together overnight can cause—well look, when a mummy cat and daddy cat love each other very much, they fuck and make a baby. And your retired vets (they hate that term) will breed, passing on their genetics to a new generation of battle-cats. So long as you have enough food to feed all the feline inhabitants of your home, you can keep on breeding as many as you wish, then pick four to take with you on your next adventure.</p>

 <p>Cats that are no longer useful to you are, um, given away. Via sewer pipes, to a range of unsavory types who want the cats for…look, it’s best not to ask questions. But give each of these unsavory types enough and they’ll bestow you with useful advantages: a bigger home, more food storage,</p>

 <p>And so it goes on. Play more, reach further, unlock more, play more, reach further, unlock more, in that idyllic cycle that marks the best of this genre. I have no doubt that&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is going to prove a massive hit, given it delivers in all those incredibly hooky ways while having a fresh approach with its constant new teams. This is made even more impressive by the sheer amount of variety on each run, with different mini-bosses appearing, new enemy types showing up, unique events, completely new sets of spells and skills getting assigned, and indeed brand new songs being performed in the midst of your encounters. Oh yes, it’s kinda a musical too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666941" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666941"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666941">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, I do take issue with some of the design. It’s possible to get phenomenally unlucky in ways that seem to undermine the ethos of the game. Random events like the Sandstorm are absolutely ruinous to a run, where every battle sees swirling sand deliver one damage to every character in the battle every round. That sounds innocuous enough, until you’re in a position where your kitties are very low on health, and reviving any who have been knocked out likely only brings them up to one health. That’s an infuriating cycle to be stuck in, and it’s a persistent effect that ruins your whole run. Not least because replacement cats tend to be pretty much useless, at which point it all stops being fun.</p>

 <p>Combine a situation like that with a mini-boss that has a 50-percent chance of avoiding hits and a run of bad luck with that, and it feels so hopeless you want to give up. But this means wiping out your whole team, losing all the coins, food and artifacts they’ve gathered, and means having to breed more cats to set out again. When all of this happened to me, I was also low on food, and then for some godforsaken reason I had three nights in a row when the cats refused to breed. So, um, it’s time to head off with the four random strays and hope. You can’t actually <em>lose</em>, because at a certain point it just forces you to have four cats and the opportunity to go on a run, but eurgh.</p> <p>I encountered so much bad luck that I began to get too frustrated. There’s an attack that’s supposed to hit 30 percent of the time. I’ve seen it hit <em>once</em> out of maybe 590 billion uses. In my direst straits I ended up with a strain of genetics in my kitties that saw them born as “pacifists” and thus unable to kill enemies—that’s a problem. Coincidences, terrible strings of coin-flips, and enemies deciding to take seven turns in a row start racking up to the point where I was just the helpless victim of the game’s RNG, in a game where the odds are already deliberately stacked against you. I started resenting <em>Mewgenics</em> instead of enjoying it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666943" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666943"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666943">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Like I say, this isn’t a condemnation of the game—it’s very obviously an extremely good one, and it delivers on its goals in vast bucketfuls. It’s wonderfully drawn, incredibly silly, and amazingly inventive. And it has so many completely fabulous songs. And look at the top: this isn’t a review! It’s up to someone willing to dedicate the hundred or more hours this game seems to need to write that. Me, I just got a bit fed up of its brutality after a bit, and while I’m still afflicted by a desire for “just one more go,” I’m also a bit cross with it too.</p>

 <p>I’m so interested to see how its toilet humor lands. It’s&nbsp;<em>so</em> childish in all the best ways, with incessant poop and pee gags, splendidly unpleasant depictions of cats rutting, giving birth, and eating one another, and even songs to go with such moments (I don’t know if it’s called “Cannibal Kitty” but that’s my favorite). It also has scenarios in which your cats can choose to eat human fetuses, spiders that crawl inside enemies and eat them from the inside out, all sorts of delightfully gross-out stuff. Although, I should add, this is far more tempered than in previous McMillen games: it’s practically a work of maturity compared to <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>‘s sensibilities. Tyler Glaiel (<em>The End Is Nigh</em>, <em>Bombernauts</em>) must be a good influence on him.&nbsp;I’m fascinated to learn how the traditional audience for a game like <em>Monster Train</em>,&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dicey Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach</em>, and so on will react to the crassness.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666944"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666944">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I also think I would have a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more time for&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> if it were on Android and iOS. This feels like the perfect game to play on my Pixel tablet, where I’d far more comfortably while away time with a run here and a run there, rather than sitting at my PC. (Obviously the Steam Deck is an option, but not the same.) It seems a mighty odd choice to limit this to PC on release.</p>

 <p><em>Mewgenics</em> reveals a colossal amount of work that has gone into making it so incredibly variable, and it’s very rewarding with all the decorative extras that surround the core loop. Its humor will <em>definitely</em> be a miss for many, but I suspect its depth and difficulty will give many cause to rise above it and play anyway. I just need some time to calm down before I go back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-secret-lair-baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-gale-2000665414"><i><span>Magic</span></i></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/even-trumps-pentagon-is-selling-rare-pokemon-cards-now-2000661388"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, trading card games are having a moment right now. Yeah, the popularity comes with some drawbacks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><span>awful online queues</span></a><span>, but it’s clear that there’s a market to jump into if you’re putting popular characters and good art on pieces of cardboard. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suspended-hearthstone-player-blitzchung-doesnt-regret-s-1841191499"><i><span>Hearthstone</span></i></a><span>, Blizzard’s </span><i><span>Warcraft</span></i><span> card game, has existed as a digital game for over a decade. Is Blizzard planning on jumping into this booming business? Not yet, at least.</span></p> <p><span>In a roundtable interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith and game director Tyler Bielman were asked if Blizzard had been considering bringing </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to physical card shops. According to Bielman, a lot of what makes the game special comes from qualities its digital platform enables that can’t be replicated with real cards, and the team is wary of losing some of those elements in translation.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>I’ll start with, we have nothing to announce today. The team [has many] big physical TCG players. I came from physical TCGs; our friends at Riot and </span><i><span>Riftbound </span></i><span>are having a moment. It’s great for them. From the very beginning, our “founding fathers” of </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>asked the question of, “What if you could remove all the pain points from physical play?” and, at that point, kind of looking at </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> as the foundational element, ‘[if you could] remove pain points around </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, too?’ And they asked all these questions, and then they put this game together in a way that is [an] incredible digital [experience]. The things that we do, mechanically, that you can’t do on a tabletop, when we go to look at expansions and new mechanics, we value those really highly. It gets a little extra oomph from us if it’s something that is unique to the digital format. If you were to translate </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>into a physical format, you would be sacrificing a lot of things that make it special. Now that said, the core of what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>a great game is pretty universal and very accessible, and that’s why we believe it’s been around for 12 years, but I think that we would lose so much in that translation, we would have to be really careful about defining for ourselves what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>great in the minds of all the players and then how much of that could we recapture if we take it to a different platform at all.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Lyons-Smith added that Blizzard wants </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to be positioned as the “best digital card game,” and that is the team’s focus, but also said that the company has been around for 35 years and a lot has changed in that time, so the company has a “long horizon” of research and development that it’s exploring. So while it has “nothing to announce” and “nothing actually even in development,” the team is happy to see the card game genre growing.</span></p> <p><span>Today, Blizzard held its </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>Spotlight presentation that laid out the game’s incoming updates, including an update based on </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Cataclysm </span></i><span>expansion, which you can watch below:</span></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/activision-blizzard-hack-maker-zenith-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1430422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Activision Blizzard is suing two alleged <em>Call of Duty</em> hack makers who—despite several cease-and-desists—won't stop making hacks, according to a new lawsuit. The company is also targeting the people who sell their hacking software. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/995333407/Activision-Blizzard-Snitched-To-Hack-Maker-s-Mom?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Activision Blizzard filed a complaint in California</u></a> on Friday targeting the makers of two&nbsp; <em>Call of Duty</em> hacks called Zenith and Devware. The hackers, known online as Wolfy and Noziex, have sold more than 28,000 licenses for the Zenith hack since September 2025, according to Activision Blizzard's complaint.</p><p>Lawyers say the Zenith hack is responsible for a recent exploit that took down five <em>Call of Duty</em> servers in May. Zenith allows players to target enemies, see through walls to better locate enemy players, and access all in-game items. It also includes what Activision Blizzard's lawyers call a "rage" feature that lets the cheating player kick others from multiplayer servers—"or to crash Activision's dedicated multiplayer servers," write the lawyers, which happened in May. Activision Blizzard has been trying to stop the two hackers since 2023, sending several cease-and-desist letters to the hackers <em>and</em> by calling one of the hackers' mothers to alert her of her son's behavior.</p><p>Wolfy, whose real name is Julian Angel Valenzuela, and Noziex, who is called A.R. in the complaint because he's a minor, started working together in 2023 on an earlier version of Zenith called Devware. Devware was popular, lawyers say, because it gave players access to paid cosmetic items for free. They continued to add features to the Devware hack, including the ability to disconnect players. "In other words, by using the Devware Hack, mean-spirited players could harass others by causing them to lose their connection to the COD Games or cause their COD Games' software to crash or stop working," lawyers write. Not only does this kick players from matches, but the disconnected players can get punished for leaving games early.</p><p>Activision Blizzard lawyers say the two sold "tens or hundreds of thousands of copies" of the hack. Activision Blizzard sent its first cease-and-desist, according to the complaint, in 2024. Wolfy, in response, posted online that Activision Blizzard "can't stop me and I aint stopping." Noziex joked about making shirts of the cease-and-desist. They continued to sell hacks, Activision Blizzard lawyers say.</p><p>In June 2024, Activision Blizzard lawyers called Wolfy's mom and told her about her son's behavior online. Activision Blizzard counsel called again days later and spoke to someone who claimed to be a brother's friend, per the complaint. That day, Activision Blizzard's lawyers called the home again and spoke to the mother, "who claimed to have no memory of the conversation four days prior," lawyers wrote in the complaint. Wolfy shut down the Devware server shortly after, saying that he was complying with a cease-and-desist from Activision Blizzard.</p><p>But Activision Blizzard claims he did not stop selling hacks. The complaint claims that the two hackers pretended to sell the Devware Discord server to another company, which lawyers say was a "front"&nbsp; to start selling a new hack—the Zenith hacking software, which basically included the same features as the Devware hack. They partnered with hack resellers to sell the software, lawyers say. Websites linked in the complaint appear to be no longer active, but a version of the Zenith hack appears to sell for $50 for a three-month subscription on third-party cheating websites.&nbsp;</p><p>Activision Blizzard sent another cease-and-desist in March 2025, and Wolfy again posted online that he's not "providing any services related to Activision Publishing," per the complaint. Activision Blizzard's lawyers say nothing's changed in his behavior since then—and then there were the "two high-profile cyber-attacks which caused the multiplayer servers for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em>" to crash. Activision Blizzard's lawyers say Wolfy used Zenith to do those attacks. In November 2025, Activision Blizzard sent <em>another</em> cease-and-desist letter. He didn't respond, Activision Blizzard's lawyers say, and instead Wolfy posted online: "I AM BACK."</p><p>Activision Blizzard's lawyers say the hacking software has caused "loss of player revenues," and has forced the company to spend lots of time and money on taking on the hackers, banning users who use the software, and employing people to "police the games to detect the COD Hacks." The damage, lawyers say, is in the millions of dollars.</p><p>Lawyers are asking the court to force the two hackers to stop making hacking software, and for the resellers to stop selling them and to destroy the software. They're also looking for damages for trafficking in circumvention devices, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, intentional interference with contractual relations, and unfair competition.</p><p>In 2024, Activision <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-awarded-14-5-million-in-call-of-duty-cheatmaker-suit?ref=aftermath.site"><u>won a $14.5 million judgement against the makers of a hack called EngineOwning</u></a>. The company is also suing 24-year-old Tennessee man Ryan Rothholz for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-25/call-of-duty-activision-blizzard-hacking-lawsuit?ref=aftermath.site"><u>his alleged role in creating the Lergware hacking software</u></a>. That case is ongoing; in February, the court denied Rothholz's motion to dismiss. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Maker Of Banned Indie Game Horses Claims Epic Is Misleading Players]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/horses-epic-steam-censorship-indie-2000666959</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been months since Epic Games <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-creepy-horror-game-steam-banned-before-launch-santa-ragione-2000647324">removed <em>Horses</em> from its PC storefront</a> and the two sides are still feuding about what exactly took place. Developer Santa Ragione claims it was ghosted by Epic while the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>maker claims it’s been transparent throughout the process. Now Santa Ragione’s co-founder and studio director, Pietro Righi Riva, has responded to the response to the response, claiming Epic Games’ “vague and semi-automated statements” provided little in the way of meaningful feedback about why</span><i><span> Horses </span></i><span>was removed from the storefront.</span></p> <p><span>This latest chapter in the ongoing censorship fight began with </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game?open=false#%C2%A7a-note-about-horses"><i><span>Game File’s</span></i></a><span> February 5 interview with Epic Games, in which it asked VP Steve Allison why the game was taken down. “My understanding is the trust and safety team thought </span><i><span>[Horses</span></i><span>] was worth taking a fresh look, and they determined that it indeed was against our policies on a couple fronts,” Allison said. “And so, the call came late—and we love that studio; we did their previous game as a short exclusive—but because that [trust and safety] team, that’s their job and that is, if you do the letter of the law on our policies, it is what it is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For context, Epic Games’ content ratings </span><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> state that games “with Adults Only (AO) ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store.” They do make an exception for games that only carry AO ratings “because they use blockchain, NFT, or cryptocurrency technology.” </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is also not available through Steam for similar reasoning, but can be purchased on GoG and itch.io.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/app.bsky.feed.post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreieobrr7wsfjrlwzargszax3mipgo43vus3xdgurceeb4qayvzrpxq"> <p lang="en">Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn?ref_src=embed">Santa Ragione (@santaragione.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/post/3mebdquhjts2k?ref_src=embed">2026-02-07T11:44:28.467Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>On February 7, Santa Ragione rejected Allison’s claim in a post </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>. “Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us,” stated Santa Ragione.</span></p>

 <p><span>Today, Epic Games followed up on Santa Ragione’s post in a statement to several publications, including </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” communications manager Brian Sharon said.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place.”</span></p> <h2>A cloud of confusion still hangs over <em>Horses</em>‘ last-minute rejection</h2> <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>reached out to Santa Ragione for clarification regarding the “incorrect statements” they alluded to in their initial Bluesky post. “On Dec 1, 24 hours before release, Epic sent us what looked like an automated notice saying that they were unable to distribute </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span> on the Epic Games Store because their review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” replied Pietro Righi Riva. “They went on to specify that their policies prohibit content which ‘contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated,’ and content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riva further explained that they responded to Epic Games’ first notice to appeal within “28 minutes,” on the basis that “all nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation” and that “the content presented does not in any way promote abuse and animal abuse.” After Epic Games’ second review of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, Riva told us that “No additional information or context was ever provided. We emailed them twice since to plead for a resubmission and find a solution but never received a reply.”</span></p> <p><span>“I do not think that those two vague and semi-automated statements would qualify as ‘contacting us twice.’ Their initial message suggested there was a path to ‘make updates to our product to ensure compliance’ but never explained what that would entail or what specifically needed change in the first place,” Riva concluded.</span></p> <p><span><em>Horses</em> has received </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><span>a range of reviews</span></a><span> since it launched, but one thing many critics seems to agree on is that there is nothing in the game nearly as scandalous as Epic and Valve banning it would imply. Adding to the confusion and skepticism is that PC gaming storefronts have been under extra pressure recently from payment processers at the behest of pro-censorship activists to crackdown on NSFW content. For all the controversy, Epic and other storefronts still haven’t made it clear precisely what they found so objectionable about the content in</span><i><span> Horses</span></i><span>.&nbsp; </span></p>

<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161885/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In a cruel twist of irony, those of us who remember the breakneck mayhem of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/carmageddon">Carmageddon</a> are creeping ever closer to our senior citizen bus pass. This will allow us to ride a slow-moving passenger vehicle that gains no extra points for mulching pedestrians.</p>
<p>Released in 1997, this classic of vehicular combat arrived with some critical praise and instant controversy. Deliberately baiting outrage with its points-for-murder gameplay, it was banned in some countries and heavily censored in others. A huge hit regardless of backlash, it spawned many sequels, ports, and imitators over the years.</p>
<p>Developers 34BigThings (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/redout">Redout</a>) are bringing the franchise back from the dead for a new generation, adding a roguelite spin in the process. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/carmageddon-rogue-shift">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a> is just as fun and addictive as the original was back in the day, though it’s a little too lightweight to be truly great.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161888/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with the setting, theme, and tone of the series, this new Carmageddon populates its tracks with zombies and mutants for competitors to mow down in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>
<p>Alongside the Roger Corman-produced <strong>Death Race 2000</strong>, the series has always drawn inspiration from the <strong>Mad Max</strong> franchise (it started life as a licensed adaptation, but publisher SCI couldn’t get the rights). Rogue Shift manages to capture the blood, chrome, and chaos of those films far better than it ever could in the '90s. Everything has a wasteland punk aesthetic, presenting a world where the need to blow each other up on a high-speed circuit is a believable way to let off steam.</p>
<p>A racing game in the thinnest sense, Carmageddon’s focus is firmly on high-speed destruction derby action. You shoot other cars to scrap while careening around makeshift courses, racking up credits by mowing down the irradiated denizens of this savage wasteland.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161884/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tracks are bonkers obstacle gauntlets, littered with swinging wrecking balls and flailing tentacles. Hordes of shambling undead and giant mutants that explode into clouds of acid conspire to sabotage your pole position.</p>
<p>The handling model can be best described as 'slip ‘n slide'. Every vehicle has a weight to it and you’ll mostly be swinging it around corners, hoping you don't clip some scenery and spin out. It can be frustrating to force a respawn after hitting a wall at max acceleration, but a perfect lap feels exhilarating once you nail it.</p>
<p>Rather than the <strong>Mario Kart</strong> approach of picking up weapons mid-race, your loadout is fixed. Each car comes equipped with a starting weapon, ranging from machine guns to lasers and everything in between. Your vehicle itself is a sub-weapon, with an effective slam ability that lets you violently shunt opponents into barriers. Seeing rivals explode in slow motion as point multipliers flash up on screen never gets old.</p>
<figure><a title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161891/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As entertaining as this metal-on-metal carnage is, it is a loop that lacks lasting appeal. That is where the roguelite elements come in. You start a new game and work through a series of randomly generated events, each with their own primary and bonus goals.</p>
<p>Events range from straightforward races, survival, and combat-focused challenges. There are also boss fights against cars packing uniquely destructive offence. The aim is to get as far as possible without being damaged beyond repair. Death sends you back to the start, but not empty-handed. You earn a currency — amusingly called beatcoin — to spend on new cars, weapons and store stock for the next run.</p>
<p>Each cycle offers the chance to try a new rig with a fresh set of stats and weaponry. Upgrades and repairs are available during a run, but difficulty ramps up at a steady pace. Early deaths are almost guaranteed in the first few attempts.</p>

<p>The unlock system does a good job of encouraging replay. It’s hard to walk away after a defeat when a massive truck with a shotgun bolted to it is waiting to be pulled out of the garage.</p>
<p>Yet even with the steady supply of new equipment, upgrades and vehicles, Rogue Shift struggles to hold attention over the long haul. Track fatigue sets in before long, and no amount of random generation can fully offset that.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that the game is solo only. This style of combat racer feels tailor-made for local and online multiplayer. Quick time to kill, rapid respawns, and short tracks are designed for spectacle rather than precision. Not being able to ram a friend into an oncoming pack of exploding mutants feels like a glaring omission.</p>

<p>That absence stings because Rogue Shift has a sense of fluid speed that arguably has not been seen since Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, which arrived with a full multiplayer suite.</p>
<p>It’s also a well-optimised version. Frame rates remain stable even during visually chaotic moments, when the screen fills with flying cars and mutant hordes. Undocked play has a surprisingly sharp fidelity, with splashes of colour and blurred neon lighting recalling the impressive Night City driving of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. The only technical hiccup of note was some occasional input lag when docked, which was infrequent and brief.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>An explosive return from this 30-year-old franchise, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is close to being the full package. It's one of those rare reboots that can satisfy older fans while also appealing to newer players drawn to the roguelite loop. It's fast, entertaining, and backed by a teeth-rattling heavy metal soundtrack.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, then, that there isn’t more of it. With no multiplayer and no additional content announced, Rogue Shift starts strong and shows real promise, but it ultimately runs out of gas.</p></section>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pendragon-core-rulebook-review-glory-awaits</link>
            <guid>1430389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Originally published in 1985, the <em>Pendragon </em>tabletop roleplaying game saw its glorious return to Chaosium with its sixth edition in 2024. Both grounded and fantastical, <em>Pendragon</em> offers players the chance to live out their dreams of courtly knighthood. As I prepare to review a new adventure module releasing for the game, I thought it prudent to take an in-depth look at the Core Rulebook, which Chaosium provided us for review.</p><h2><strong>What Is </strong><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p><em>Pendragon</em> is a tabletop roleplaying game created by Greg Stafford and published by Chaosium, where one player takes on the role of Gamemaster while others pick up the mantle of Player-knights.</p><p>The world of <em>Pendragon</em> revolves around King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and while your Player-knights won’t start at such lofty levels, their chivalry and glory are the north-star for which you’ll be aiming.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-squire.jpeg?itok=bxw-0nIy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1420" height="950">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pendragon-squire.jpeg?itok=1I5RyeNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="803">
                  

  </picture><p>This is not a game about blasting magical spells and healing your party with a wave of holy magic as you face down hordes of evil goblins. Nor is it about amassing untold wealth by cracking open treasure chests.</p><p>Instead, <em>Pendragon</em> is a game about acting as a true knight, hoping to attain both honor and glory as you embark on quests, woo your true love, and pursue your passions. For players used to the ramshackle, reality-breaking world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> or <em>Pathfinder</em>, this game may feel a bit “down-to-earth,” but that - in my opinion - is what makes it so special.</p><h2><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em><strong> Traits, Passions, and Skills Define Your Player-knight</strong></h2><p>In <em>Pendragon</em>, there are five main statistics to each character: Size, Dexterity, Strength, Constitution, and Appeal. But while these statistics are important, they hardly define your Player-knight.</p><p>Where your Player-knight truly begins to take shape is through a set of 13 pairs of opposing Traits, like Chaste/Lustful, Generous/Selfish, Prudent/Reckless, and Valorous/Cowardly. This collection of traits is one of the most unique aspects of <em>Pendragon</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-king-and-performers.jpeg?itok=eYrNn0Bf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1140" height="812">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pendragon-king-and-performers.jpeg?itok=VLV9o4rY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1140" height="812">
                  

  </picture><p>For each trait, you’ll assign points (or roll randomly) to determine your how your character is likely to behave and move about the world. The sum total for each opposing trait pair must equal 20, so if your character has a 14 score in Generous, their Selfish trait is only a 6. This means they’re more likely to act in a generous manner.</p><p>I only go into this much detail when describing how these traits work because I truly believe this is the most interesting element of the game. By rolling dice on these traits, you’re aided in your roleplaying. This helps confirm how you see your character when you roll well, and opens up interesting opportunities for role-play when you roll unexpectedly.</p><p>For instance, let’s imagine your Player-knight is about to square off against an imposing brigand nearly twice your size. Your Valorous/Cowardly score is 6/14, meaning you’re (currently) known for being a bit of a coward. But as you roll on the trait, something strange happens - you fail your cowardly roll and succeed in your Valorous roll! Against all odds, your character takes a brave stand!</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-battle.jpeg?itok=2R-Yavk4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1230" height="786">

  </picture><p>What an interesting way to approach roleplaying! Along with Traits, you have Passions - these are the goals, ideals, and interests that drive your character forward. From Homage to your lord to love of your family, pursuing these passions will help drive your character forward.</p><p>And then, like most Tabletop RPG’s, you also have skills. But unlike most RPG’s, these skills - from Awareness to Battle, Compose (as in poetry) to Falconry - cover far more than your traditional adventure-focused game.</p><p>That’s because <em>Pendragon</em> is about so much more than swinging your sword and charging on your horse (though there’s plenty of that). <em>Pendragon</em> is an RPG where a misstep in court, a miss-play in a game of chess, or an uncouth moment in front of your true love could be just as disastrous as any blow from an axe.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-chess-match.jpeg?itok=hIn8Q_Ni 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1452" height="838">

  </picture><h2><strong>What is </strong><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em><strong>’s Core Mechanic?</strong></h2><p><em>Pendragon</em> uses a d20 system for determining successes and failures when attempting actions, and uses a d6 when determining damage. This is an interesting system, where players attempt to roll <em>under</em> their attribute, trait, or skill to succeed.</p><p>For instance, if I have a Player-knight with a Flirting skill (yes that’s a real skill) of 12 and I’m hoping to flatter my true love, I’ll roll a d20 and hope for a 12 or less. A critical success is a success that perfectly matches your attribute (a 12 in this case).</p><p>If I’m opposing someone in a roll, I not only need to roll <em>under</em> my skill, but then if I succeed I also need to have rolled <em>above</em> what they rolled (if they also succeeded).</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pendragon-young-knights.jpeg?itok=vzs1tLgN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="818">

  </picture><p>This creates a very interesting tension, where I’m hoping to run my dice as close to failure as possible (while still succeeding). It’s a system I’ve never seen used anywhere else!</p><h2><strong>What else does the </strong><em><strong>Pendragon </strong></em><strong>Core Rulebook cover?</strong></h2><p>What <em>doesn’t</em> it cover!? The <em>Pendragon</em> Core Rulebook is over 230 pages long, and includes character creation rules, rules for combat, equipment, a whole (fairly long!) chapter on horses, pursuing noble aspirations, advancing your knight, and so much more.</p><p>I’m the kind of player who loves to get lost in the details, and so, for me, I find these extensive notes, tables, and charts extremely satisfying. If you’re the kind of player who doesn’t feel the need to get bogged down in all the small details, there’s also a Starter Set that well get your gaming group into the action with daring speed.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em><strong>Pendragon</strong></em> <strong>Core Rulebook - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><em>Pendragon</em> is, for lack of a better term, “a lot of game.” By that I mean that there is so much here to dive into, both on the part of the Player-knights and the Gamemaster. This isn’t the kind of game you can pop into with a silly group in-between <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign sessions.</p><p>This is the sort of Tabletop RPG that players need to come to knowing what they’re getting into. You won’t be flinging fireballs or whipping chains of lightning around the room, but you just might impress the nobles of your house with your poetry. In fact, that sentence should serve as a litmus test - if your play group responds to that statement with anything other than “By Merlin’s beard! We need to play right now,” then <em>Pendragon </em>may not be right for your playgroup.</p><p>But, on the other hand, for the group who values a serious approach to Tabletop RPG’s, <em>Pendragon</em> offers a unique place in the gaming world. Here’s a game that’s more grounded in reality, but <em>doesn’t</em> treat your characters like worthless dogs barking in the bowels of a dungeon. Too often, when you trade high-fantasy for reality, you end up with a game like <em>Torchbearer</em> (which I love), where your a low-down dirty adventurer, or like <em>Dungeon Crawl Classics</em> (which I love), where you’ll be lucky to survive your first encounter with a rat.</p><p>Instead, <em>Pendragon</em> presents a gaming world where the highest challenge is upholding the goals your Player-knight sets for themselves, seeking out ways to grow your honor, act nobly, and pursue glory. It asks players to imagine a world where they are, unambiguously, at least <em>trying</em> to do the right thing more often than not, and the murkiness of the world around them bends and snaps in reaction.</p><p>If everything I’ve written here sounds, to your play group, like it might lead to a legendary campaign, then I heartily recommend <em>Pendragon</em>!</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Pendragon <em>used in the creation of this review was provided by Chaosium.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-leave-ceo-build-a-rocket-boy-mindseye/</link>
            <guid>1430383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leslie Benzies, co-founder and co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, the developer behind MindsEye, is reportedly on ‘temporary leave’ from the firm. This was confirmed by the <strong>other </strong>CEO, Mark Gerhard, who recently revealed an alleged €1 million plot to sabotage BARB and MindsEye.</p>



<p>Per an email from Gerhard to the wider company, Benzies is taking a ‘well-earned temporary leave to recharge after more than a year of working around the clock.’ But following that, Gerhard stressed he’d be guiding the company forward and signed off his email as ‘CEO’ and not ‘co-CEO’.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-did-leslie-go">Where Did Leslie Go?</h2>



<p>It has been a tough few weeks for the team at Build a Rocket Boy. After the disastrous launch of MindsEye, the studio’s inaugural game, and several bouts of layoffs, the team was hit again by yet another scandal earlier this month. Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar North fame, found himself accused of sexual assault in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/">recently uncovered ‘Epstein file.’</a></p>



<p>He categorically <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ex-rockstar-north-president-denies-epstein-files-allegations/">denied the assault</a> but confirmed he was in a consensual relationship with his accuser.</p>



<p>In a new report published by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/can-build-a-rocket-boy-save-itself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, it was revealed that an email posted by Mark Gerhard after an all-hands call confirmed Leslie Benzies’ temporary departure from the company.</p>



<p>Gerhard worded the email quite strangely, making it sound like the absence might be a little longer than you might assume:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>He has our deepest gratitude, and with the leadership team and your support, I will guide us forward.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report expanded with comments from former and current employees at BARB, one of whom explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think BARB survives this crisis. I believe the end is coming for BARB, and it’s not heralded by saboteurs, but by Mark and Leslie themselves.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That was in response to Gerhard’s claim of having evidence that Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye were subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">a ruthless and targeted campaign</a> to bring the brand down. Insider Gaming recently published a report detailing this exact claim.</p>

<p>The latest patch update for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> features new Meshes, audio updates, weapon updates, and so much more.</p>



<p>On February 9, Apex Legends announced the launch of their latest season: Breach. With the new season comes a range of updates, including the all-new Hardlight Mesh. These meshes serve as destructible, breachable windows. They are translucent, block projectiles, and affect player movement.</p>



<p>They allow players to create new entry points and attack angles, and they rebuild after a significant delay following damage. Controller Legends can also reinforce them to become more sturdy and allow them to bunker down, delaying enemy assaults.</p>







<p>In the latest patch, there are also updates to different Legend types. The Fuse type has received major updates, particularly to its ultimate, which now drops a mortar that detonates on impact, then sprays smaller bombs around its landing point. Additionally, they’re no longer slowed by explosive damage, have faster weapon stow time, and more.</p>



<p>The Apex team described the Catalyst type as “needing help for a while.” They can now reinforce up to four doors, have a maximum of three traps, and work in a larger area.</p>







<h2>Audio Updates Included Also</h2>



<p>Additionally, the Apex team announced audio updates for season 28. There are now more audio customization options, providing finer-tuned control over: Legend Dialogue, Ping Dialogue, and Announcer Dialogue.</p>



<p>Players can check out the full patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Brings the Cold Snap Back to ARC Raiders and Launches a PvE-Focused Event Tomorrow]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-shared-watch-pve-event-embark-studios/</link>
            <guid>1430359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <strong>Embark Studios</strong> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-players-can-prepare-for-the-second-expedition-with-a-new-catch-up-mechanic-and-lowered-stash-value-requirements/">a few changes coming to Expeditions</a> in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> to help players be better prepared to send off their Raiders into the unknown. Now, as we near the end of the first Expedition, the team has confirmed the next event that'll start tomorrow and bring players to the end of the month.</p>



<p>Firstly, Embark is bringing back the <strong>Cold Snap</strong> map condition as part of the regular rotation of map conditions players can experience starting tomorrow, <strong>February 10, 2026</strong>. It was a fun map condition for the winter season, and added an interesting layer of survival gameplay to your runs Topside, because you had to make sure you didn't get caught out in the cold for too long. It's good to see it make a return, and hopefully, Embark makes a habit of keeping beloved map conditions around, even if they're introduced as part of a seasonal event. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clear skies and sunny temperatures are predicted for Topside this weekend, but don't pack your winter gear away yet folks; the weather towers are predicting sporadic snowfall in the foreseeable future!<br>The Cold Snap returns to our regular rotation of conditions from February 10… <a href="https://t.co/J4OACyBc9y">pic.twitter.com/J4OACyBc9y</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020180761849331776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote>

<p>Second, and perhaps most exciting for ARC Raiders players cut from a certain cloth, is that the studio will kick off a new, <strong>PvE-focused</strong> event called <strong>Shared Watch</strong> tomorrow, February 10, that'll run until <strong>February 24, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>More information about the event is set to arrive in tomorrow's patch notes, but the basics of it are that players will progress through the event's rewards by earning <strong>Merits</strong>, which will unlock items, Raider tokens, and a new baseball-themed <strong>Slugger</strong> cosmetic set.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders might technically be a PvPvE game, but depending on who you ask, some players would describe it as an entirely PvE game. Scores of players within the community are seemingly uninterested in participating in the PvP components and would rather work together with their fellow Raiders to take down ARCs and gather loot.</p>



<p>It's unclear if this event will include a PvE-only mode, but it's definitely PvE-focused, as it encourages players to work together to take down ARCs, which is one of the best thrills that ARC Raiders offers outside of the tension of safely extracting to Speranza by the skin of your teeth.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> first Lego sets</span></a><span> are launching later this month for the series’ 30th anniversary, but some reviewers and creators have gotten early access to the sets and are building them for coverage. These models are made up of hundreds or thousands of pieces, and sometimes, Lego sneaks an easter egg or two into the build. This is the case with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914"><span>Eevee</span></a><span> model, which has a hidden reference to the Pokémon’s various evolutions.</span></p> <p><span>Eevee’s whole schtick is that it’s able to evolve into one of several evolutions depending on certain conditions, including the time of day, the use of a certain evolution stone, or whether or not it knows a Fairy-type move. Each form is pretty distinct, with each carrying a different color scheme, elemental theme, and shape. While Eevee’s eight evolutions aren’t getting their own Lego sets (yet), the Eevee model’s innards are a nod to each of them.</span></p>

   <p><span>As TikToker and Lego creator Bricks By Mind demonstrates, the inside of the Eevee model includes colored bricks that correspond to each of its evolutions. Parts of it are made up of yellow, orange, and blue bricks that resemble the colors of the electric Jolteon, flaming Flareon, and water-wielding Vaporeon, respectively. Meanwhile, the inside of the head has a brick for each of the other evolutions stacked next to one another behind its eyes. This includes the aforementioned three, but also blocks for the Ice-type Glaceon, Grass-type Leafeon, Psychic-type Espeon, Dark-type Umbreon, and Fairy-type Sylveon. It’s a neat touch.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, the Eevee model is the cheapest of the </span><i><span>Pokemon </span></i><span>Lego sets, and will only run you $59.99 compared to the $200 Pikachu one, or the staggering $649.99 you’ll have to pay for the Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise one, when they all launch on February 27.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> is encouraging players to team up with strangers in the next <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> event, which launches tomorrow, February 10.</p>



<p>The Shared Watch event was announced in a social media trailer and will run through February 24. </p>



<p>While not specified, the caption states that players will clean up with strangers to turn their barrels on the machines, hinting at a PvE event. Still, people in the comments were asking for clarification as to whether this would be a PvP event.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-follows-this-event-in-the-arc-raiders-roadmap">What Follows This Event in the ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>



<p>Following the conclusion of the shared watch event on February 24, players can sign up for the second in-game Expedition on February 25. The event will begin on March 1. This time around, ARC is introducing a Skill Point catch-up system, which will allow players to reclaim some coins they missed during the first Expedition. </p>



<p>Each missing Skill Point from the first Expedition now only requires 300k stash value, and any Coins collected will first count toward the second Expedition before being applied to previously missed Skill Points.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor</link>
            <guid>1430350</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Zero Parades is an exploration of failure,” explains Jim Ashilevi, writer and VO director at ZA/UM. “What it means to lose everything and then keep going regardless. And then, since it's such a painful question, it inevitably becomes an exploration of what it means to be human. How uncomfortable and strange it is to exist in a body that has thoughts and feelings and responsibilities, and a past that they can't go back and fix.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is why I love working here,” says ZA/UM’s head of studio, Allen Murray, with a smile. “I never had these conversations making Halo games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> was, of course, never going to follow up its 2019 “disaster cop” RPG with a game about heroes saving the world. That’s not to say that it hasn’t moved into <em>slightly</em> more traditional video game territory, though. Its new game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/zero-parades-for-dead-spies">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies</a>, is an espionage spy thriller set in a dark, almost psychedelic reflection of the Cold War’s closing years. Global powers conspire, enemy agents lurk in the dark, and the entire world sits on the doorstep of the end of history. But while that could theoretically be the elevator pitch for any number of mainstream, combat-forward RPGs, ZA/UM is doing spycraft the only way it knows: Disco style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the one North Star that we have is that we have to be genuinely interested in the stories that we are choosing to tell,” says Ashilevi. “If we were to start mimicking someone else, or go bigger and more expensive and add production value and fighting mechanics and multiplayer, I think we would just destroy ourselves in the process.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This “North Star” means that, on the surface, Zero Parades looks almost identical to Disco Elysium. It’s another dialogue-centric, introspective, isometric RPG with striking art direction. But that’s not to say it’s the exact same game dressed up in a John le Carré skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think you can see the team has really wanted to exceed their production chops with Zero Parades,” explains Murray, “in terms of having the world seem more reactive, more lived in. There's more action, more people walking around doing things.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ZA/UM had no intention of creating a “traditional” video game RPG, it did want to dig deeper into the genre’s more crunchy elements. This time around there are more skill checks, alongside a mental and physical health system that can be exerted to increase the chances of passing those checks. There’s further emphasis on multiple solutions to individual problems, the very foundation of BioWare’s celebrated Infinity Engine games. By pushing the depth of choice available and enhancing the world’s reactivity to those choices, the team saw the opportunity to create something that stood distinct from Disco Elysium.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sophomore efforts are really challenging,” Murray admits. “You don't want to repeat your first hit, nor can you really.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took a lot of time for the team to come to terms with that. During the years following Disco Elysium’s release and subsequent “Final Cut” version, ZA/UM experimented with a number of concepts – some were effectively direct sequels, while others explored “a completely different direction,” according to Ashilevi. The path to Zero Parades arrived with the decision to “not fully reinvent the wheel.” The goal, Murray says, was to “expand on what we know how to do, and make a bigger game, both mechanically and in terms of production scope, and do it well.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mission Control</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Murray acknowledges that there were “years of drama” before the studio got to that point. For many fans of Disco Elysium, that will mean only one thing: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>the firing of several key creatives in 2022</u></a> and their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-directors-accuse-zaum-shareholders-of-fraud-as-the-company-says-they-were-fired-for-misconduct"><u>subsequent accusation</u></a> that ZA/UM’s executive management had seized control of the company through fraud. It’s a complicated chapter in the studio’s story, in which those exorcised from the company – including game director Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov – are characterised as either toxic disruptors or the victims of corporate conspiracy, depending on your source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more to ZA/UM’s troubled recent history than those controversial dismissals: this is a studio that has repeatedly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs"><u>cancelled projects</u></a> and, in early 2024, made 20 of its staff redundant. It all paints a picture of an inexperienced studio struggling to adapt to life after releasing an unexpected mega hit on the first attempt, with the workers caught in the crossfire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ZA/UM’s UK-based workforce unionised last year</u></a>. </p><p>The artistry comes first, the storytelling comes first. It still feels like the whole video game development side of things is just like a happy accident.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while collective bargaining is undoubtedly important, those workers also need strong leadership to avoid the woes of the past. Maybe they’ve found that in Murray, a 20-year veteran of the video games industry with previous tenures at Microsoft, Bungie, PopCap, and Private Division. He was appointed as ZA/UM’s new head of studio shortly after news broke about those painful redundancies, and over the past two years his goal has been “coaching the people in the studio, maturing our processes, helping people to really focus on what we're making, how we're making it, and why we're making it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was easy to have a lot of things sort of floating around,” he admits. “But how are we <em>actually </em>going to animate this, or how are we going to light this? What does this story really mean? What are you really trying to get across to the player?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, ZA/UM is made up of around 90 members of staff. Several of them have, like Murray, been recruited from established developers such as Rocksteady in order to arm the studio with specialist video game experience. But the remaining members of the Disco Elysium team, which makes up approximately 35% of the studio’s total roster, plus many of the new recruits, “come from a background that has nothing to do with game dev,” says Ashilevi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a studio, we still view ourselves pretty much as a collective of artists,” he explains. “The artistry comes first, the storytelling comes first. To me personally, it still feels like the whole video game development side of things is just like a happy accident.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Price of Power</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to Zero Parades, which tells the story of Hershel Wilk, codename “Cascade”, who’s pulled out of retirement for the all-time classic spy trope, One Last Job. By moving into the espionage genre, ZA/UM has been able to work at a notably different scale than it did with Disco Elysium. While Zero Parades takes place in a physical space not too dissimilar to that of the studio’s previous game, by stepping into the shoes of a spy rather than a local detective, the story naturally explores a much grander stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You do have to contend with world powers,” Ashilevi reveals. “It's not just wallpaper, or stuff that you read from notes that people leave in drawers, or newspapers left on tables. You do have to come into close contact with some of the big players as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This global stage is explored through Hershel’s very personal lens, so while the stakes are certainly heightened this time around, your actions are still conducted at street level. You may be able to turn the cogs of a mega corporation and shift the balance of worldwide politics, for instance, but to do so may require betraying your closest friend. Hershel’s own pain will be tangible, whereas those rotating cogs will feel distant, perhaps even unimportant, to her own life. Such is the toll of espionage.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/zero-parades-format-fetishist-1770647663407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hershel will encounter people obsessed with niche corners of pop culture. | Image credit: ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To create something that reflects Disco Elysium’s triumphs, though, you can’t just tackle issues of the human condition. You’ve got to get at least a little eccentric. And that’s where Hershel’s hobbies come into play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“She's deeply fascinated with comic books, music, you name it,” Ashilevi reveals. “So the story is also an exploration of pop culture and what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>soft power</u></a> means. Why is it important for us to be obsessed with pop artists and cartoons, and films and pulp novels, and things like that? Why are people so deeply obsessed with retro tech and bootlegged media, like underground forbidden films? What does it do to your soul, and how does it define your identity?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While music, fashion, TV shows, and retrofuturistic music formats all contribute to the city of Portofiro’s vibrant texture, there is a dark side to it all. What is a consumer as a political entity? How do tiny decisions, like tuning into a particular show or buying a certain magazine, tie into the movements of the big powers? These are potential avenues for Hershel – for you – to investigate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle for soft and hard power, waged between international banks, imperialist states, and communist unions, is something that goes beyond just Hershel’s current mission. “We need to come up with an inspiring enough sandbox so that whatever we choose to do with those characters or this universe next, we can just jump right into it and keep telling stories because the groundwork has been laid,” says Ashilevi. Zero Parades is the starting point for something bigger, then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least that’s the hope. The world of Elysium was also envisioned as a space for multiple stories, but it seems that book is now eternally closed. And while Zero Parades may not necessarily need to be as significant a breakout hit as Disco Elysium was to unlock the potential for sequels, it does need to stand tall in a world where the “Disco-like” is a rising genre, made up of games developed both by fans inspired by that RPG masterpiece and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick"><u>new studios set up by the scattered former members of ZA/UM’s original creative team</u></a>. But by following their own creative North Star, the team behind Zero Parades hopes to captivate players once more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have no clue what kinds of games or stories people are hoping to get out of ZA/UM,” Ashilevi says. “The only thing we can control is whether we're staying true to our own vision and voice. And that's what we have done with Zero Parades.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has reportedly partnered with Korean gaming giant Nexon for yet another crack at turning StarCraft into a shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While unconfirmed by Blizzard itself, the project is the subject of an article in <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Korea Economic Daily</a>, the country's largest business newspaper. The report states that Nexon has a development team dedicated to the project within its shooter division, with a StarCraft modder installed as its project lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has long held ambitions to launch a shooter spin-off from its sci-fi real-time strategy series, while Nexon has recently found Western success within the shooter space as the owner of Swedish development studio Embark Studio — the outfit behind The Finals and Arc Raiders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the report is cautious on the project's development — noting that Nexon previously partnered with Square Enix to develop a Final Fantasy spin-off that faltered in the planning stages. A note of caution here is likely wise, too, considering Blizzard's own track record on abandoned StarCraft spin-off projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost">StarCraft Ghost</a>, announced in 2002, was Blizzard's first attempt to expand the series beyond its real-time strategy origins. Planned as a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second StarCraft shooter attempt, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>. Ares was reportedly "like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe," but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside. Finally, in 2024, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier shared word of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">third StarCraft shooter project then in development within Blizzard</a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Nexon's shooter be the same project as the one Hay had been leading, or a new iteration of it? This remains unclear, especially since Hay's project had apparently been in development two years ago, whereas Nexon's game sounds more recent — and developed on a different continent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports are foundational to gaming as a medium. From Pong to NES Baseball, the infancy of the medium was littered with just-about-recognisable renditions of real-life sports in an attempt to conjure a degree of familiarity to this fledgling form of entertainment. But in the mid ‘90s, the developers at Nintendo collectively had a light bulb appear above their head housing an idea that would change gaming forever – what if Mario and his friends <em>played tennis?</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The greatest Mario sports games are a perfect blend of those two words: Mario and sports. It has to be a simulation worth its salt, giving you a reasonable adaptation of what it’s truly like to play the sport in question. However, just as vital is the Mario part, splicing the sport with the Mushroom Kingdom’s trademark personality. In the decades following 1995’s Mario’s Tennis, Nintendo’s sports games evolved from simple sims to wacky adventures, before retreating back to a steady, if uninspiring, run of titles. The early days of Camelot Software’s handheld RPGs and chaos-inducing console sims are seemingly long gone, and today many of Mario’s sporting outings are greeted with more of a shrug than with anticipation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> releasing this month on Nintendo Switch 2, we could be about to enter a new era. So in celebration of a joyful future (or just a magical past) here’s the top 10 Mario sports games, ranked. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Mario Sports Games</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mario Hoops 3-on-3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-hoops-1770302985415.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">If many modern Mario sports games are poisoned by a lack of personality, games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-hoops-3-on-3-mario-slam-basketball">Mario Hoops</a> are the antidote. 3-on-3’s unique presentation blends 3D models with excellent sprite work, a striking approach that bridges the graphical styles of the GameBoy Advance and Nintendo’s then-new DS handheld. Nothing represents this mix better than the character select screen, the single greatest in all of Mario history, which lays the groundwork for a charming basketball romp. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoops could easily claim to be the best use of the DS’ touch screen. Tapping in different areas sees Mario and his friends dribble around the court, keeping the ball away from opponents and collecting coins and items. It’s an intuitive motion, and that use of the stylus extends to all the basics of basketball, like shooting and passing. Regrettably, Nintendo has rarely returned to the idea of basketball in the Mushroom Kingdom, but even if it did try again, few consoles would execute the idea better than the DS… well, as long as you’re not left-handed, that is. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Mario Tennis (Game Boy Color)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-tennis-gbc-1770303000447.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The early days of handheld Mario sports games produced some of the most unusual oddities in Nintendo’s history, and their lack of Mushroom Kingdom whimsey and focus on regular human characters is often looked back upon with a raised eyebrow. However, actually dive into the Game Boy Color’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-gbc">Mario Tennis</a> and you’ll find that eyebrow is put firmly back in place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Tennis features a wonderful RPG “Tour” mode that nails the genre’s basics. Being locked into three-set matches with a far more powerful opponent is akin to boss battles in a more traditional RPG. They become challenges that you relish, always pushing you to move more quickly after a serve or time your smashes to perfection. Working through the tour sees you levelling up your original character via a very satisfying process, with the grind required to improve specific skills never feeling like a chore. The graphics and controls are inherently limited by the console, but that simplicity lends Mario Tennis a lovely rhythmic quality that encourages repeat replays even a quarter of a century later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Mario Golf: World Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-world-tour-1770303082047.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For as slow and ponderous as the sport of golf can be, it’s a miracle that it consistently dovetails so beautifully with the chaotic and colorful world of Mario. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-world-tour">World Tour</a> nails the balance between both sides of the Nintendo sports coin, offering a quick and snappy way to execute precise and considered rounds of golf. With no need for complicated button schemes or deep systems, World Tour gives you a great sense of control that allows you to cut through the fiddly stuff and get to work on the eternal quest of improving your swing, just like a real casual golfer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 3DS and Wii U era was a difficult one for Mario sports titles, but World Tour stands out from a lacklustre crowd thanks to its personality-packed game modes like Point Tourney, Star Coin challenges and Speed Golf. Castle Club also adds a story mode centred on your Mii, complete with a fun upgrade system with stat-boosting cosmetics like clothes and clubs, which is reminiscent of Camelot’s handheld glory days. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mario Superstar Baseball</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-superstar-baseball-1770303206159.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like basketball, Nintendo has barely paid any attention to baseball across the past couple decades, despite knocking it out of the park on the first try back in 2005. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-superstar-baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a> is a wonderful marriage of addictive baseball mechanics and Mushroom Kingdom chaos, played out in iconic Mario locations that have been contorted into baseball fields. Only in Wario Palace could a barrage of environmental hazards turn a home run into a devastating out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superstar Baseball boasts one of the Mario sports series’ most engaging story modes  thanks to its “chemistry engine”. The relationships between your teammates dictates the speed and accuracy of their passes, meaning you won’t want to pair Mario with Wario and Bowser, but he’ll combine beautifully with Luigi and Peach. It’s a simple and effective way to bring depth to an already smooth experience that belongs in the Nintendo big leagues.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Super Mario Strikers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-super-mario-strikers-1770303339338.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s amazing what a little pop of 2D animation and a few guitar riffs can do to make a subset of Mario sports games feel completely unique. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-strikers">Super Mario Strikers</a>, the jumping plumber’s first foray into the world of soccer, has always had a rebellious edge. Anyone who was glued to their GameCube in the mid-2000s will  look back on it with a special kind of fondness, especially in the light of its disappointing revival on Switch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia for Strikers isn’t just due to its bold presentation, though: its gameplay is perfectly calibrated. Each character controls just loosely enough to invite exactly the right amount of chaos into each and every match. If the dial was turned too far towards clean passing and shooting, Mario Strikers would be nowhere near as fun. Instead, developer Next Level Games created something aggressively competitive, wholly chaotic, and vibrantly unique – everything a Mario sports game should be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mario Golf: Advance Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-advance-tour-1770303536951.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Golf: Advance Tour is one of the Game Boy Advance’s true gems, launched during a time when developer Camelot was proving itself as a Nintendo sports powerhouse. Compared to its predecessors it is genuinely beautiful; the GBA was an absolute haven for bright and colorful adventures and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-advance-tour">Advance Tour</a> benefits greatly from the system’s then-advanced capabilities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those vibrant visuals are just the face of a game that takes the proven and perfected RPG structure from Camelot’s previous sports games and introduces even more Mario characters and locations to the mix. On the gameplay front, despite only having two face buttons available, Camelot designed a great-feeling, tight control scheme that ensured each shot you took felt measured and clean. That sharpness became a design philosophy that continues to stick around throughout every installment in the Mario Golf series. Advance Tour remains special to this day, though, thanks to its unique pixel art rendering of otherworldly courses, and the GBA’s form factor making it the perfect game to pack for on-the-go strolls through the Mushroom Kingdom’s premier golf courses. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mario Tennis (Nintendo 64)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-tennis-n64-1770303675344.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The moment you play your first shot in the Nintendo 64 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis">Mario Tennis</a>, something just <em>clicks</em>. The responsive gameplay, smooth animations, and freeing analog control creates an indescribable sense of elegance. Long rallies become like trances in which you find yourself less determined to win the point and instead simply addicted to the sensation of knocking the ball back and forth. Well, until you completely mistime a shot, Toad falls flat on his face, and you’re suddenly a couple sets down, that is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in the year 2000, Mario Tennis is another example of deep gameplay that requires just two face buttons and directional controls, representing Nintendo at its most simple and effective. Subsequent tennis games went on to add ideas, gimmicks and modes that undeniably helped them surpass the offerings of this N64 title. But the bones of modern Mario Tennis are all here, a timeless gameplay loop perfected 26 years ago that endures throughout Nintendo’s history.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-toadstool-tour-1770304306552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of what we expect from modern Mario sports games originated back on the GameCube, and the brilliant Mario Golf formula established by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-toadstool-tour">Toadstool Tour</a> is one that Nintendo has defaulted to over the last couple decades. Its use of normal and power shots, manual or automatic swinging, and approach to camera control are all now staples of 3D Mario Golf titles for good reason: the simplicity just <em>works</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That simplicity gives Toadstool Tour plenty of space to carry out an overwhelming charm offensive. There are so many different ways to play, especially in multiplayer, from the conventional Doubles and Tournament modes to the more eccentric Coin and Ring attacks, giving Toadstool Tour a shot at being the best party game on this list. It’s also the Mario Golf game that does the sport itself the most justice while still feeling quintessentially Mario. It’s simply a great bit of goofy, golfy goodness. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mario Power Tennis</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-power-tennis-1770304379782.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything that made Mario Tennis on the N64 so brilliant is preserved and built upon with the GameCube’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-power-tennis">Mario Power Tennis</a>. The console’s extra horsepower is used to add wild flourishes to the courts and characters, allowing the established, excellent 3D tennis formula to thrive alongside a deep collection of crazy Mario-isms. Smartly, developer Camelot decided against making full use of the GameCube’s iconic multi-button controller, understanding the enduring appeal of a simple control scheme, while still finding a way to add deeper mechanics, such as offensive and defensive skill shots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with fun challenge courts that test specific tennis skills and Item Battles which create chaos over the net, Mario Power Tennis boasts feats of creative genius like Artist on the Court, a mode in which you use your tennis skills to paint a mural.These may not be flagship modes, but they add the kind of personality and flavour that you can’t get from anyone else but Nintendo in today’s gaming landscape.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Mario Strikers Charged</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-super-mario-strikers-charged-1770304475821.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Power Tennis and Toadstool Tour benefited from the excellent foundations of their predecessors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-strikers-charged">Super Mario Strikers Charged</a> takes every beloved detail from the original Strikers and advances them several steps further. Its refined design places increased emphasis on tactics; each character now has stats and special abilities, which makes playstyles and team composition as vital to victory as actually kicking the ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Strikers Charged the very best game in this list, though, is how that tactical play is enhanced through Super Abilities and Mega Strikes, AKA the greatest gimmicks ever introduced to a Mario sports game. Abilities like Yoshi turning into a giant egg and flattening people across the pitch, or Bowser setting players on fire, or Petey Piranha spraying mud in every direction provides a variety of incredibly silly, yet highly tactical opportunities. The Mega Strikes, meanwhile, increase the level of hype around the proceedings, triggering a cut scene and allowing you to score up to six goals in one go. This is a great arcade soccer game, but Super Mario Strikers Charged is also completely out of its mind, and it’s that wonderful blend that makes a Mario sports game truly great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are our picks for the very best Mario sports games. Did we get a hole in one, or have we suffered a triple bagel?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creative Director/EP Nick Herman and AdHoc CEO Michael Choung also discuss the "miracle" behind making a video game. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a million things that have to go right for a video game to be a success. Well, maybe not a million. But a lot. Michael Choung, the CEO of AdHoc Studio – which released the popular superhero workplace comedy game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review"><u>Dispatch</u></a> last year – admits as much. Choung says that there were “probably 20 decisions in the last seven years” that aligned to make the game a huge success. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-game-performances-of-2025"><u>casting Aaron Paul</u></a> as Dispatch’s protagonist, Robert Robertson/Mecha Man, was one of those decisions. </p>I spoke exclusively with Choung and Dispatch Creative Director/Executive Producer Nick Herman ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-ghost-of-yotei-rule-the-annual-dice-award-nominations"><u>DICE Awards</u></a> (Dispatch is nominated for six, including Game of the Year) on February 12 to break down everything that had to go right in order for Dispatch to see the light of day. Herman says that, although they had “pretty decent” temporary tracks out of the  stand-in actors they hired before the main cast got into the studio, Paul’s performance pushed the entire development of the game in a new direction. <p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we cast Aaron Paul and brought him into the booth, he brought a lot more gravitas,” Herman says. “He brought a heaviness to the character that started to allow us to take him more seriously. You can actually feel that he's got this burden on his shoulders and this weight from his past, and the game got a little bit more serious. When we were working with him we realized that was a good thing. We wanted that depth to show up in the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Paul, perhaps best known for his Emmy-winning turn as Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad, is nominated for a DICE Award for Outstanding Achievement in Character, a nomination he shares with Herman and Dispatch’s other Narrative and Creative Directors. Laura Bailey, Paul’s co-star in the game who plays Courtney/Invisigal,  is nominated for the same award. Herman says that assembling an all-star cast – which also includes Jeffrey Wright, Matthew Mercer, and Ashley Johnson – was both a creative and strategic decision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We knew that we wanted to have some big talent that when people see the name, they’d go, ‘Oh I know who that is. I know that actor and I like them,’” Herman says. “Aaron just read the script and he liked it. So we were very fortunate. We needed that tier, especially when you're going into rooms with a lot of suits who have a lot of money and make decisions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there's a desire for people to want there to be this puppet mastery strategy around this stuff,” Choung adds. “But we just like these voices. You want it to be creatively compelling. (But) then you have these other additional bonuses: (the actors) having a huge audience, they (come from) different worlds. A lot of them were friends. They were people that we'd worked with before. So it’s years and years of experience just coming to bear.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/27/dispatchthumb-1761592135786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Invisigal (voiced by Laura Bailey) in Dispatch</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Dispatch has become both a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review"><u>critical</u></a> and commercial success, both Herman and Choung are reflecting on the intense reaction to the game. I asked them each if they could point to a single thing they were most proud of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can dislike it, but the tone is unique and the result of countless numbers of decisions,” Choung says. “It’s a very strange alchemy that results in a tone like this. I'm proud that we stuck to our guns and we were okay with something a little off the beaten path.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had a lot of bold ideas that people told us were maybe a little too risky,” Herman adds. “People were saying there's no money in narrative experiences. This stuff is dead. Removing freewalk, not having exploration, focusing on having one core main mechanic. All of these things are things we wanted to try for for a very long time. And we've treated Dispatch like this is our one shot, like this might be the last time we ever get an opportunity to make something on our own together. I think all of those things combined is the reason Dispatch is successful. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dispatch Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fact that it worked and that people were responding to it is awesome. I hope other people learn from this. Just go fucking nuts if you can. I'm proud that we went as hard as we did and we took as big of a swing as we could. Whether it's an indie game with one developer or it's a larger studio, it's hard and it's a miracle when a game gets made every time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to catch IGN’s exclusive broadcast of the 29th Annual DICE Awards on Thursday, February 12 at 8pm PT. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.
