            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With the second season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> set to launch, the game’s communications team has shared a list of updates players can look forward to.</p>



<p>While new maps and challenges are already known to be coming to Battlefield 6<a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/2021313449754755403?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">, major updates are also on the way,</a> bringing quality-of-life improvements, faster progression, and more.</p>



<p>One such change includes faster Battle Pass progression. The team notes that this season will be more rewarding and that Battle Pass Tokens earned from Career XP have been recalculated, allowing players to progress faster through regular gameplay and weekly challenges.</p>



<p>Additionally, in-game movement has been improved. The team behind Battlefield 6 now says it feels more predictable and readable during fast-paced action changes, including acceleration curves, smoother vaulting, and smoother ladder transitions. The team has also made fixes that reduce visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-updates-coming-to-redsec">Updates Coming to REDSEC</h2>



<p>REDSEC is Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale mode. This community update notes that there will be more rewarding progression in the mode, as Career and weapon XP earn rates have been increased. Hopefully, baseball helps progression feel more balanced between the regular gameplay experience and Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Also, they are increasing overall armor availability in REDSEC. Plus, they’re introducing a cooldown on Vehicle Keycards as a mission reward after players acquire one. This is intended to help balance tank access in Battle Royale mode.</p>







<p>Learn more about what’s coming in season 2 of Battlefield 6 at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-launches-next-week/" id="175564">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering just had its most financially successful year yet, Hasbro has announced. And it's largely thanks to its collaborations with other brands, via its Universes Beyond and Secret Lair releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its earnings call today, Hasbro revealed that MTG revenue was up 59% year-over-year, in no small part thanks to the Avatar: The Last Airbender set last year, which is now the third highest-selling set in Magic history after Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. Other Universes Beyond sets, as well as Secret Lair, also had a hand in the success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That 59% is a huge increase, and one that is responsible for Hasbro's overall numbers looking good. The company overall was up 14% year-over-year, almost entirely driven by 45% growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment (Monopoly Go! also helped a little). Its other segments, Consumer Products and Entertainment, both saw declines of 4% each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The revenue-raising capabilities of Universes Beyond and Secret Lair are a helpful look for Hasbro's C-suite, which has found itself the target of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set">shareholder lawsuit on the very subject recently</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Hasbro has mismanaged Magic: The Gathering by overprinting sets of cards, specifically Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, thereby devaluing existing cards. The complaint itself contains some pretty sharp accusations that the company's top brass have been holding such sets in reserve to deploy whenever the rest of the company is struggling.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avatar: The Last Airbender x Magic: The Gathering - Tea Time at the Jasmine Dragon Scene Box</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Hasbro has stated that such claims have "no merit," and has recently moved to dismiss a similar lawsuit with very similar accusations filed in 2024 by the West Palm Beach Firefighters' Pension Fund and City of Miami General Employees &amp; Sanitation Employees' Retirement Trust, on the basis that the complaint has been amended so significantly since it was originally filed that it is no longer related to the original issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro reached out to share the following updated statement on these lawsuits as pertains to its earnings today:</p><blockquote>As we shared when you covered the matter in January, these claims have no merit. Our strategic plan for Magic was implemented, and the results underscore the strength of that strategy. As further reflected in our earnings results released this morning, Magic: The Gathering just completed its most successful year ever.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering's next set will be a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch">Universes Beyond set for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, complete with commander deck, and will release on March 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s already made back the cost of its roughly seven-year development, blew past internal sales expectations, and is currently approaching the highest peak concurrent player count of Isaac itself – and it only launched today at 6am PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot,” developer Tyler Glaiel tells IGN, saying it likely took less than three hours for development costs to be fully recouped. “Its a bigger launch than any of the Isaac expansions already, and its only been a few hours.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His partner Edmund McMillen, best known for games like Isaac and Super Meat Boy, put just how wide of a gap that is into a perspective: “I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was [The Binding of Isaac:] Rebirth, and it sold 40,000 units I think day one.” By comparison, McMillen says Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in its first five-and-a-half hours. “Isn't that kind of insane?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewgenics is also sitting at more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>63,000 concurrent players</u></a> on Steam at time of writing, creeping steadily towards Rebirth’s all-time peak of 70,701. “We knew the game was good and would do good,” Glaiel says, “but Isaac is *HUGE* so we thought it was unlikely to beat that.” There are also almost 85k people watching it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mewgenics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a> – one of which is McMillen himself, who says he’s enjoying watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Northernlion</u></a> be so immediately good at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The critical reception for Mewgenics has been glowing as well, currently sitting at an 89 on sites like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Metacritic</u></a> and 96% positive user reviews on Steam (with roughly 1,700 in at the moment). IGN’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review"><u>Mewgenics review</u></a> gave it a 9/10, saying it’s “a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director.

            <title><![CDATA[Discord Goes Into Damage Control Mode Over New Age Verification Requirements, Promising There’s Nothing To See Here For ‘Vast Majority’ Of Users]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358</link>
            <guid>1431712</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve never seen patch notes issued for a press release before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">but Discord just did exactly that</a>. The company has updated the language around its new age-gating rules to make clear that the “vast majority” of users have nothing to worry about because the company’s AI will be able to accurately estimate their age and bypass the controversial new verification procedures rolling out over the next few months.</p> <p>It’s been a rough 24 hours for Discord, <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">the modern hub for gaming conversations online</a>. The company revealed new age verification requirements on February 9 that would lock users out of certain features, like “age-restricted experiences,” unless they upload a face scan or a picture of their ID. The blowback was swift and loud, with calls to boycott Discord’s paid Nitro subscriptions and return to old-school website forums.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s why Discord returned a day later to post a “<a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/2021297270281384424?s=20">novel</a>” that goes into more detail about its new age assurance rules. “Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord,” the company promised in a new addendum on February 10. “The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm let me play the roll of Clippy and help you</p> <p>Your Age Inference model is already running and has much more then just Age predictions. <a href="https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI">https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI</a></p> <p>Not requiring everyone: because you are already using your AI to capture data and age predict Age, Sex, etc. Hence…</p> <p>— Rakunvar 👀P.R. for @StreamerHouse🏘️ (@Rakunvar) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rakunvar/status/2021320521011560775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s because Discord’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7czEt1_Zeic">AI&nbsp;inference model</a> will be used to guess most users’ age. If it guesses a number that’s 18 or higher, you’re in the clear. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to give the company your sensitive data in order to get around the new teen safety protocols. But Discord is quick to stress that this doesn’t apply to most people because most people don’t ever access adult content on Discord.</p>

 <p>“You must be a confirmed adult to access age-restricted content and experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings,” the company <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">explains in a new FAQ</a>. “The majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content and will never go through a facial age estimation flow or ID verification. In the minority of cases where we cannot confirm you as an adult and you need to access age-restricted areas and settings, then you will be asked to go through additional steps.”</p>

 <h2>Archived servers and canceled Nitro subs</h2> <p>All of this “our big announcement wasn’t actually a big deal” energy came after an immediate user revolt that saw, among other things, Discord <a href="https://x.com/discord_support/status/2020863471550927243">repeatedly get community noted on X</a>. People didn’t like the idea that Discord is already constantly surveilling its users to <a href="https://x.com/Vuthakral/status/2020893257987748166">build an anonymous profile of you</a> that I’m sure it’s not hoping to further monetize <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">once it reportedly launches its secret IPO</a>.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that all of this is coming after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">pretty bad hack of a Discord vendor last year</a> that saw age verification materials, including photos of users’ faces, obtained by malicious actors. The company says it doesn’t keep this information tagged to your user data, but if you think there’s a safe way to digitally transmit your face and/or your government-issued ID to a company over the internet in 2026, then I have some <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">totally not killer AI robot assistants to sell you</a>.</p>

 <p>While the backlash has been noisy, it’s not clear how many people will actually shift away from Discord over the new rules, though some diehard users on the Discord subreddit already claim to be calling it quits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1r09lrn/bailing_and_i_want_to_archive_my_server_are_there/">One popular thread</a> had a server owner looking for help with archiving it before they leave the platform. Some users on social media, meanwhile, have been making <a href="https://twitter.com/KuroSekaiAnime/status/2020954657502515520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2020954657502515520%7Ctwgr%5Ee4437406b5c679e87bcd39b015eb003b843caf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fdiscord-nitro-cancelled-age-verification%2F">public displays of canceling their paid memberships</a>, Discord’s main source of revenue.</p> <p>So far, non one seems to be biting on the company’s latest attempt to deescalate people’s fears. “If this isn’t reversed I will be cancelling my Nitro and all Boosts,” one user wrote on X. “I recommend everyone does the same.” Discord’s amended announcement, like the original, is already well on its way to getting ratio’d.</p>

      <p>Following in the commendable tradition of gargantuan charity bundles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-relief-bundle-games-wandersong-short-hike/"><u>the Palestinian Relief Bundle</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser/"><u>Play For Peace</u></a>, over 600 game developers have come together to assemble a <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota?ref=aftermath.site"><u>No ICE In Minnesota bundle</u></a>. Just one day after release, it has already smashed through its initial $100,000 goal.</p><p>“We created this bundle to raise funds for Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota in response to the Trump administration sending ICE agents to the Minneapolis area and the reckless murder of an innocent people by ICE agents,” wrote the bundle’s organizer, a tabletop charity content creator who goes by the handle <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesthehuman.itch.io?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jes The Human</u></a> on the bundle’s itch.io page. “ILCM provides free immigration legal representation to low-income immigrants and refugees in Minnesota and North Dakota. They also work to educate the community about immigration matters and advocate for public policies which respect the universal human rights of immigrants.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k_JPei0YNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="No ICE in Minnesota Charity Bundle Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>The bundle includes 1,439 games for a minimum donation of $10, which is a steal so preposterous that you’ve gotta admire the audacity. Highlights include modern puzzling classic<em> Baba Is You</em>, fellow modern puzzling classic <em>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</em>, cozy game by which all others are judged <em>A Short Hike</em>, internet detective adventure <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>, cat cafe sim <em>Calico</em>, and multiple gun-focused games from <em>Demonschool </em>studio Necrosoft. There are also <em>over 1,000</em> physical games – tabletop role-playing games and things of that nature – ensuring that you’ll never need to rack your brain to figure out something to do when your friends come over ever again.</p><p>The bundle will be available until March 13.&nbsp;</p><p>"ILCM provides services based on capacity and has a generally high demand for services," wrote Jes The Human.

If you like your board games a little less physical, and a little more not technically a board game any more if we're being honest but that's fine because it's a neat looking, strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now, then boooooy howdy do I have the game for you! Those familiar with the dungeon crawling tabletop game Descent will be interested to learn that it's getting a video game adaptation in the form of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent.
</p>
<p>
Before we press on, I'd just like to say that it's specifically Terrinoth with the all rights reserved symbol, <em>then</em> it says Heroes of Descent. That's silly! Don't do that! It makes your game name look weird. Anyway, this just so happens to be the first game adaptation of the modern classic board game, and it's sounding like a pretty tight experience overall.

<p>
For starters, there's eight different adventurers to choose from, which judging from the trailer includes some guys that can do magic, some gals that can slice 'n' dice or shoot a bow and arrow, a thiefy lookin' fellow, the usual kind of fantasy RPG type characters. Dungeon crawling is still the name of the game too, with apparently 20 dungeons to play through, all with different storylines, and characters that'll adapt to whichever adventurers make up your party.
</p><p>
I quite like that on the Steam page it highlights that the different missions you can complete in the main campaign can be beaten in one night, makes it feel like it's going for a "getting the gang together for DnD" kind of vibe. Which you can do! Because there's co-op for up to four people at once.
</p>
<p>
The combat is described as accessible, though that is more meant in terms of it being not annoyingly complex as opposed to having accessibility features. It's turn-based, with a big emphasis on positioning, elevation, line of sight, and timing, all that jazz. For those more familiar with the board game's story, Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is also a prequel to Descent: Legends of the Dark, but that'll probably mean more to those in the know than it does to me.
</p>
<p>
And there's even a demo you can try out right now, which is quite nifty as there's no release date other than sometime this year, so it'll give you something to mess around with until then. You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929630/Terrinoth_Heroes_of_Descent/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The patch notes for Overwatch’s Season 1 are here. Updates include general quality-of-life fixes, updates, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>recently announced that, with the launch of its next season, it would revert to the name “Overwatch” after several years as “Overwatch 2.” Along with these changes comes a story-focused mentality and a new Rise of Talon story arc.</p>



<p>The February 9 patch notes detail a new conquest event and some updates fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The conquest event will be a 5-week-long event. Players will choose their faction each week and can represent either Overwatch or Talon. After making their selection, there will be weekly faction challenges with their own rewards. Once the entire pass is unlocked, players can choose to switch factions and earn all of the faction-specific rewards on that side as well.</p>



<p>Learn more about the faction warfare and new Heroes added to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-to-be-renamed-overwatch-with-next-update/" id="174168">here</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-mode-update-clash-leaving-quick-play">Game Mode Update: Clash Leaving Quick Play</h2>



<p>In a game mode update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>announced that Clash has been removed from Quick Play. This also means removing Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis from the map selection. It is stated that the mode will remain in Stadium, and it may return to Quick Play in the future.</p>



<p>“We have some amazing new maps lined up for the next year, and our reworks will continue…and get bigger. Redesigns that completely change how certain areas of our maps play are coming soon.”</p>







<h2>More Information on the General Updates to Overwatch</h2>



<p>New updates also feature a revamped UI that focuses on your friends and favorite Heroes. Loot box updates include a selection of Cosmetics from Seasons 15 through 20. Also, players can now adjust the Field of View on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro consoles.</p>



<p>Much more is included in the official notes. Read the full patch notes <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, there may be "a new series on a different line"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9342ae3b609b1"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9342ae3b609b1/yakuza-kiwami-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside continuing the stories of Kazuma Kiryu and introducing the world to Ichiban Kasuga, Sega and RGG Studio has spent about a decade bringing back some of the older <strong>Yakuza / Like A Dragon</strong> games for modern audiences. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>, out on 12th February, is the latest of those remakes, following on (naturally) from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a>. But it sounds like, rather than moving onto the fourth game, the end of the Kiwami series is here (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/no-more-yakuza-kiwami-games-after-kiwami-3-story-changes-new-series-could-happen">Push Square</a>!).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wCglSfda04">Ryusta TV livestream</a> broadcast earlier today, RGG Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama said that "I think 'Yakuza Kiwami 3' will be the last one, and the 'Kiwami line will come to an end." (translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1r17x0o/yokoyama_announced_kiwami_3_will_the_last_game_in/">u/Dastanovich on Reddit</a>.)</p><div><figure data-videoid="MWHW8NC1uMo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytMWHW8NC1uMo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8af228lrjwpy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Of course, that's far from the end of the Yakuza — after all, we need more Ichiban in our lives (especially on Switch 2) — and Yokoyama elaborates that "I don't think it'll continue as the 'Kiwami' series anymore. I think a different series will begin. And not something like 'Like a Dragon 9,' but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning."</p>
<p>This sort of sounds like new timeline stuff, but it also means that Yakuza 4, Yakuza 5, and Yakuza 6 will be skipping the remake treatment — presumably. But with Yakuza Kiwami 3 reportedly making some controversial cuts and changes to the game's story, there's perhaps too much friction between the Kiwami games and the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Yokoyama seems to suggest that's the case, as he says the decision to stop the Kiwami games "... might be something you'll understand once you play 'Yakuza Kiwami 3.'"</p>
<p>Reviews for the upcoming remake have been more on the mixed side than Yakuza is used to. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">We scored it a 6/10 on Switch 2</a>, for example, with our own Ollie Reynolds calling it "a fair series entry, but one that's tainted by poor pacing and a recasting controversy that simply didn't need to happen."</p>
<p>So, what's next for Yakuza / Like A Dragon? A break? The next game? RGG <em>is</em> also working on a brand new IP, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stranger_than_heaven">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, and appears to be unrelated to RGG's premier franchise.</p>

I ranked it as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">best Switch 2 controller</a> you can buy, thanks to its satisfying rumble sensation in games, support for motion controls as well as Nintendo’s amiibo NFC figures, plus the ability to remotely wake your console. Not to mention, it has durable TMR joysticks that are designed to last a lot longer than the hardware used by Nintendo in its controller.</p><p>I think it’s worth considering even at its original $59.99, but it’s considerably cheaper for the rest of the day at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM7Z4D7D/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. You can get the black version for $41.99, and the blue and white version is $44.99.</p><p>I’d wager that most people aren’t willing to spend $89.99 on Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller. Even for those who have the cash to splash, the S10 proves to be just as comfortable to use, even during long gaming sessions. Aside from lacking the Switch 2 Pro’s 3.5mm headphone jack that’s used for private listening, this controller is functionally identical. My biggest issue with the S10 is that the Screenshot, GameChat, and Home button placement is cramped, leading to some accidental presses. But at this price, it’s easier to overlook a small design flaw.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/876544/easysmx-s10-switch-2-wireless-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

Discord states in the post that “age prediction” using information Discord already has will likely be sufficient for many users:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’ve seen some questions about our age assurance update and we want to share more clarity. We know how important these changes are to our community.</p><p>Here’s what we want you to know:</p><p>• Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord.</p><p>• The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.</p><p>You need to be an adult to access age-restricted experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings.</p></blockquote></div><p>However, in the case that Discord’s age inference model can’t accurately or concretely estimate a user’s age, they will still have to use a video selfie or ID to verify that they’re an adult.

            <title><![CDATA[No, AI Written Romance Novels Are Not Inevitable]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ai-romance-novel-new-york-times/</link>
            <guid>1431643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In an article called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/08/business/ai-claude-romance-books.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The New Fabio is Claude</u></a>,” the New York Times speaks to romance novel “authors” who claim that AI is the future of the genre. This is both obviously untrue, but also not at all what these two authors have demonstrated with their financial success from using AI.</p><p>The Times spoke to two authors who use AI to write entire books. One, who uses the pen name Coral Hart, says that by using prompting and Claude, she can generate an entire book in 45 minutes. Interestingly, she also sells courses about how to best use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. Hart has become an A.I. evangelist,” the article reads. “Through her author-coaching business, Plot Prose, she’s taught more than 1,600 people how to produce a novel with artificial intelligence, she said. She’s rolling out her proprietary A.I. writing program, which can generate a book based on an outline in less than an hour, and costs between $80 and $250 a month.”</p><p>Out of curiosity, I checked out the Plot Prose website. The “script the draft” package on the homepage of Plot Prose promises it can deliver “your next novel 90% complete and fully packaged for publication,” saying you can skip the “hardest part” of writing, which is writing. She also offers “AI creation kits,” which are pre-packaged drafts and outlines that also include “AI-writer optimized scene beats for fast execution.”</p><p>Another so-called “author,” Elizabeth Anne West, says that eventually, readers won’t care if a book is written by AI. Coincidentally, West <em>also</em> sells courses on how to use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. West, who also teaches classes on how to write with A.I., has gotten blowback from opponents of the technology, including occasional death threats on social media,” the article says. “But she believes that in time, A.I. generated fiction will become widespread and popular.”</p><p>In between these two buried pieces of context–that both of these writers have an economic interest in the success of AI in the writing space because they sell courses on how to use AI to write books–this article only barely describes whether or not these books are any good or if readers like them. Another author who uses AI to write romance novels even admits that the technology is pretty bad at doing so.</p><p>“Whenever Ms. Rompoti’s curvy protagonist, an event planner named Sienna, was in a scene, the A.I. constantly referenced her weight, for example, noting that a chair groaned when she sat down,” the article reads. “‘When you make a point that someone is plus size, it will exaggerate, somebody is suddenly humongous,’ Rompoti said.”</p><p>Both Hart and West claim that their courses are popular—Hart makes the claim that even authors who are against AI in public sign up for her classes–but of course they would. They both run businesses that depend on the idea that romance novels are best written with AI. Except, curiously, West also says that the books that have a disclaimer about AI being used in the writing process don’t sell as well.</p><p>“If you hide that there’s A.I., it sells just fine,” she told the Times.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy/"><div><p>You Don’t Need AI To Write A Novel - Aftermath</p><p>AI isn’t a privilege issue, no matter what National Novel Writing Month says</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure><p>My response to this as a journalist and reader of the occasional romance novel is: of course she would say that. Of course she would say that “eventually, audiences won’t care.” Hart and West have a vested economic interest in this technology succeeding in the literary space. Hart claims she made six figures off of her AI-published romance novels, mostly because she uses AI to produce a manuscript in under an hour. She said that her 200 AI books garnered collectively 50,000 sales, meaning each book sold on average 250 copies. The only way this is a viable business model is if you don’t care if the books are good or if people like them.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, my friend and romance novel author Ella Dawson pointed out that the GoodReads presence for both Hart and West paints a sobering picture of how these books are received. Most of Coral Hart’s books on GoodReads<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/54945185.Coral_Hart?ref=aftermath.site"><u> are rated one or two stars</u></a>. West’s work seems better received, but I think it’s worth pointing out that it appears that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/5204939.Elizabeth_Ann_West?ref=aftermath.site"><u>every single piece of fiction she has published is fanfic about <em>Pride and Prejudice</em></u></a>, a work currently in the public domain, making her entire output dependent on the work of another author as a baseline.&nbsp;</p><p>“This reporter got snowed,” Dawson told me over text. “The New York Times has a bumpy track record when it comes to taking the romance genre seriously (a Fabio headline? In 2026? Seriously?) but I’m still baffled by their decision to profile these AI-reliant con artists masquerading as authors.”</p><p>For these AI evangelists featured in this article, finding a dedicated audience and reaching those readers through the quality of your work is not the goal. Writing for readers to “feel seen,” as Rompoti describes in the Times’ article, is immaterial. The goal is to make money using fiction. These people have already decided that the fiction they produce is not art—it is content, and the best way to make money through content is either to produce a lot of it, or sell a course on how to get rich fast by producing a lot of content.</p><p>Even according to the Times’ own reporting, readers do not seem to like AI romance novels. One of the two AI critical sources quoted in the article said that she would never knowingly pick up a book written by AI. Another, an author whose work had been scraped by Anthropic to train their AI model, pointed out that flooding the zone with slop makes it much harder for real human authors to be discovered by readers.&nbsp;</p><p>What I found most curious was Coral Hart’s reasoning for using a pseudonym in the article. Coral Hart is a retired pen name and the source would not give any of her current pen names “because she still uses her real name for some publishing and coaching projects. She fears that revealing her A.I. use would damage her business for that work.” Huh! That’s weird!</p><p>The lack of care paid to the actual readers of these AI books feels like a deliberate exclusion. The article describes romance readers as “voracious” and romance novels as “reliant on formula." Ergo, romance novels don’t have to be good, because romance readers will read any old shit as long as it has a Happily Ever After!</p><p>“Credulous reporting like this does nothing but prop up the lie that these ‘authors’ and AI companies desperately want us to believe: that the proliferation of AI across every industry is inevitable .It isn’t! I mean seriously, why would you ever take the word of a self-proclaimed coach who sells courses on using AI to create novels?” Dawson told me. “Readers are not ATMs, romance novels are not content to farm, and if you can’t write a book without firing up a plagiarism machine, you’re not meant to be an author.”</p><p>There’s not much daylight between what these two women do and what’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3xSJuoUnN8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>described in this Super Eyepatch Wolf video about “Influencer Courses” grifts</u></a>. Through the course of this video, the improbably named John Walsh actually takes some of the YouTube influencer courses only to discover that the people selling these courses don’t even have the YouTube numbers to back up the claims they make. One person selling a multihour lecture about how to be successful on YouTube only had 4,000 subscribers.</p><p>It’s the same model for these grifters. If you make the claim that you are successful—claims which the Times makes very little effort to confirm independently—then you can become a subject matter expert, and sell your expertise for a pretty penny. And the content itself can be complete bullshit that sucks and no one likes, because the content is merely an advertisement for the courses you sell. And those courses don’t have to be good, either! You can just charge $250 for bullshit!</p><p>To me, this is all evidence that <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>AI is still a forced meme</u></a>. You don’t have to listen to the grifters who tell you that “eventually” everyone will be using this technology and that no one will mind if their books are written by AI. That eventuality is not a guarantee, and there is no real indication that it will ever arrive. Similarly, Christa Désir, vice president and editorial director of Bloom Books, says that AI books will become “undetectable at a certain point.” Handily, to make a prediction like this, you don’t have to provide any evidence to support your claim. You can just say shit, and the Times will print it.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><div><p>AI Is The Ultimate “Forced Meme”</p><p>There are few things in this world more insufferable than a rich person trying to force their shitty ideas on everyone else.

			<p>Last week, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted the second of <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">its flurry of showcases</a> to kick off 2026 with an <strong>Overwatch Spotlight</strong>, digging into the future of the game and everything players can expect for the coming year. Outside of the official name change back to just 'Overwatch,' we got a look at everything coming in <strong>Season 1: Reign of Talon</strong>, which has officially gone live.</p>



<p>The showcase clearly reinvigorated the Overwatch community, because not only did the game have its "<em>biggest weekend by player count in over a year</em>," according to a press release after the showcase, but the launch of the new season has driven it to reach a new peak concurrent player count on Steam. At the time of this writing, Overwatch has reached <strong>107,004 concurrent players on Steam,</strong> stomping the previous peak of 75,608 players that came when Overwatch (then Overwatch 2) arrived on Steam in 2023.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Across 2026, Blizzard will add a total of 10 new heroes to the game, with <strong>five</strong> of those heroes all arriving in Season 1. The five new heroes are <strong>Domina (Tank), Emre (Damage), Mizuki (Support), Anran (Damage),</strong> and <strong>Jetpack Cat (Support).</strong></p>



<p>The classes for each hero will, of course, be recognizable for veteran players, but it's worth remembering that today's update and the arrival of Season 1 also introduce several mechanical changes, like the introduction of sub-classes that all heroes are categorized into on top of their Support, Damage, and Tank classes. If you want a refresher on more of the mechanical changes and the UI/UX changes coming in today's update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">check out our breakdown</a> of everything that came out of the Overwatch Spotlight.</p>



<p>There's also the introduction of a new narrative structure, which sees the story of each hero unfold through cinematics, animated comics, in-game events, and map updates. The first cinematic shows Vendetta defeating Doomfist, which you can check out below if you missed it during the Spotlight.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-shiny-hunting-costumes-kyogre-2000667344</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny hunters</span></a><span> are Arceus’ strongest soldiers in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, but I think we may have found the strongest among them. One fan did a somewhat unorthodox Shiny hunt not in one of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs, but in a 20-year-old battle simulator spin-off on the Wii. Collecting these alternate-colored monsters in it is far more complicated than doing so in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game.</span></p> <p><span>User Noa_Kyogre on X (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-player-spends-5-years-completing-one-of-the-weirdest-shiny-hunts-in-history-immediately-promises-to-never-do-it-again/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>) took five years to find Shiny costumes in </span><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution</span></i><span>. The Wii game doesn’t have wild Pokémon encounters, but its various trainers can dress up as monsters if the player chooses to wear themed outfits based on creatures like Groudon, Kyogre, Roserade, and Lucario. However, it’s possible to find these outfits in their respective Pokémon’s Shiny colors, such as a yellow-and-green Lucario rather than its usual blue-and-black color scheme. It will just take you thousands of hours of playtime to do it.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can acquire these outfits by beating a trainer wearing them in the game’s single-player mode, but each of these trainers shows up during what is essentially a long boss rush of high-level battles, and their outfits have as little a chance of changing as a rare Pokémon has of showing up in a base game. That’s a roughly 1 in 8192 spawn chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケモンバトルレボリューション (通称バトレボ)<br>日本語版と海外版 それぞれで色違いコスチューム コンプリートしました！😋💫<br>多分、史上初だと思います🤔<br>海外版は肌の色が3種類から選べるので褐色ガチ神！😍<br>多分5〜6年ぐらいこの厳選やってました！🤣<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E8%89%B2%E9%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#色違いポケモン</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShinyPokemon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ShinyPokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shinyhunt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Shinyhunt</a> <a href="https://t.co/20K0tvLc9F">pic.twitter.com/20K0tvLc9F</a></p> <p>— のあ (@Noa_Kyogre) <a href="https://twitter.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020371004934221837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>So, if you want to Shiny hunt these outfits, you’ll have to reload and fight through these battles over and over just to get one of them. That wasn’t enough for Noa_Kyogre, who has collected the full set of six, not once but twice, and asserts they are the first person to do so. The double dipping came from finding the full set in both the Japanese and international versions of the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s definitely worth the bragging rights, but is it worth the likely insanity you’ll subject yourself to in order to get it? Probably not, and Noa_Kyogre says they will </span><a href="https://x.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020382448736207114?s=20"><span>never do it again</span></a><span>. I’m surprised they didn’t come to that conclusion the first time through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution </span></i><span>was pretty maligned back in the day for being more of a battle simulator than a full-blown game, but it does still have some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-animations-wii-scarlet-violet-1850362666"><span>best animations of the series’ 3D games</span></a><span>. It really captured each monster’s personality in a way that doesn’t come across in games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but it also had the benefit of a much smaller Pokémon selection than most modern games. </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>, the Switch and mobile battle simulator </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><span>coming later this year</span></a><span>, is essentially its spiritual successor, and will act as the battle platform for competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>moving forward.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/" id="96159">RGG</a>‘s Masayoshi Yokoyama has stated that Sega’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/yakuza-kiwami/" id="154859">Yakuza Kiwami</a> series will conclude with the third installment, setting the stage for a new series.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yakuza-kiwami-3/" id="2971">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> is set to release on February 12. It is the latest in the line of Kiwami remakes for the Yakuza series. Unfortunately for those looking for more of this style of game, Masayoshi Yokoyama revealed during a recent livestream that the forthcoming game will be the series’ final installment, making way for new games with a different title. The spin-off will not be comparable to the Like A Dragon series either.</p>



<p>“I don’t think it will continue as the ‘Kiwami’ series anymore. I think a different series will begin, and not something like ‘Like A Dragon 9, ‘ but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning. This might be something you’ll understand once you play Yakuza Kiwami 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-yakuza-kawami-3-also-comes-bundled-with-dark-ties">Yakuza Kawami 3 Also Comes Bundled With Dark Ties</h2>



<p>In addition to the remake of 2009’s Yakuza 3, this new game also comes with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/" id="173294">Dark Ties DLC</a>. In this expansion, you will play as the antagonist of Yakuza 3, Yoshitaka Mine. This is a prequel story following Mine as he joins the Yakuza Tojo Clan. </p>



<p>This version is comparable to Sonic x Shadow Generations in that it gives players a choice of which mode to launch first.</p>

<p>Still coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><em>Are</em>Fans are still speculating as to what exactly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> is — part a remaster and rerelease of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_2_goodbye_despair_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa 2</a>, part a brand new scenario, the game is largely shrouded in mystery. But while we wait for more info (and a firmer 2026 release date), Spike Chunsoft has opened up pre-orders for the physical release of the game.</p>
<p>On both Switch 1 and Switch 2, Danganronpa 2x2 will be getting a standard physical release — stocked at various retailers for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> — which appears to include the game fully on the card for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Plus. there's a special collector's edition, appropriately-named the 'Psycho Tropical Vacation Package'. This will set you back <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> and includes a RSVLTS reversible Psycho Tropical hat, a Kidrobot 3" figure of bother tropical Monokuma and Monomi, an OST which includes remixes of the best tracks from the original game, and a clamshell-style outer box to display your collection in.</p>
<p>In addition, if you pre-order directly from <a href="https://store.spike-chunsoft.com/">Spike Chunsoft</a>'s Shopify page, you'll get a 4" Monokuma Flight Tag.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aee2552de968a"><a title="Danganronpa 2x2 Psycho Tropical Vacation Package" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aee2552de968a/danganronpa-2x2-psycho-tropical-vacation-package.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spike Chunsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Canadian store <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/products/danganronpa-2x2-standard-edition-nintendo-switrch-pre-order?bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP</a> has also opened up pre-orders for the game for <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong> (or <strong>$194.99 CAD</strong> for the special edition). European European orders will be handled by Reef Entertainment.</p>
<p>We haven't seen much of Danganronpa 2x2 since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">its reveal at the September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, though it was shown off at the Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Fes: Ultimate Appreciation Festival back in November.</p>
<p>The "all new storyline" being added to this rerelease is reportedly meant to be as long as the base game, which means double the content. And probably double the shenanigans. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_v3_killing_harmony_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa V3</a>, anything is possible...</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Binding Of Isaac Dev’s New Game Takes 500 Hours To Complete And Will Take Players ‘Months or Years’ To Find All Of Its Secrets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-completionist-secrets-hours-binding-isaac-roguelike-2000667343</link>
            <guid>1431577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Tuesday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the tactical RPG-slash-life-sim roguelite about breeding and battling cats, created by developers behind </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Closure</span></i><span>, launched and almost immediately shot to the top of Steam’s charts. </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>seems like it’s shaping up to be the next big hit for roguelite sickos, in no small part thanks to how absolutely massive its scope is.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/"><span>an AMA on the Steam Deck subreddit</span></a><span> over the weekend, developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel teamed up to answer fans’ questions about the game, and they revealed that it’s a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>larger than anyone previously expected. In one response, McMillen referred to the game as “one of the largest tactical RPGs of all time.” In another, he revealed that “it will take an average player about 200+ hours to ‘beat the game’ and 500+ hours to 100% :)” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/its-going-to-take-you-over-500-hours-to-100-percent-complete-mewgenics-according-to-creator-edmund-mcmillen/"><span>PC Gamer</span></a></em><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Judging by the game’s 281 Steam achievements and the fact that it has 1,000 unique abilities to unlock, that estimate doesn’t sound like much of a stretch. And it seems like </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ most dedicated players might end up pouring quite a few extra hours into hunting for secrets. According to Glaiel, “there’s a lot of little things that I think people will be discovering for months or years. But we will reserve the true ARG level stuff for DLC.” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-dlc-secret-unlock-arg-binding-of-issac/"><span>Polygon</span></a></em><span>).</span></p> <p><span>While the base game’s absurd length should tide players over for a long time, McMillen also said the team is planning on beginning work on the game’s DLC in the next few months, with a planned release around a year later. McMillen also hinted that a Switch 2 port might be on its way. The game is currently only available on PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>From delayed development to the top of the charts</h2> <p><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>was announced all the way back in 2012, but the project entered a long period of development hell (and was even cancelled at one point). Despite the game’s wildly tumultuous development cycle, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><span>apparently pretty good</span></a><span>. It’s currently the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">highest-rated game</a> on Metacritic for the year so far. If <em>Binding of Isaac</em>‘s trajectory <a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-designers-new-game-is-both-uncomfortab-1728533526">is any indication</a>, this is only the start of a long and wild post-launch life for <em>Mewgenics</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I haven’t had a chance to pick up the game yet, but I’ve been having a blast watching players share their freakish findings online all day. Even McMillen couldn’t resist sharing some of his own discoveries in the AMA—he wrote: “my nephew Eli had one where he could punch one of his other cats in the face and it would send out 1000 sparkles to totally destroy all enemies instantly…the game is so insane man, you don’t even know.”</span></p>
