            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> set a new gold standard for the genre back in 2020, the mechanics and structure of the isometric action RPG roguelites have become somewhat staid. The maze of rooms, the choice of exits, the array of collectables, the slowly progressing unlockables, the narrative that teasingly develops after every run; let’s face it, most of us could play a new genre entry in our sleep. Sure, we’d die a lot, but it’d be doable. So, it’s refreshing that Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree attempts to do something new with the standard formula, even if it isn’t always successful in the process.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it42ZeHoj2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In what can charitably be described as an unbelievably tedious opening cut-scene, we learn that Towa, a priestess of Shinju, has been tasked with defeating a vile demonic entity dubbed Magatsu. She’s not alone in this endeavour, and is joined by eight guardians on her journey, the Prayer Children, and it is the addition of these guys and gals that mark the game’s first deviation from standard genre form. See, rather than a player character fighting their ways through hordes of demons solo-style, they are joined by a tag-team partner to form a dynamic duo. The first character takes the lead on movement and combat, whilst their colleague, tethered to them by a magical leash, provides defensive and offensive spells.</p>


<p>It’s a neat dynamic, and one that offers a vast variety of tactical options. You are given complete freedom to ally each distinctive member of your team with another, and in whatever combination you prefer. Highlights amongst the wonderfully bonkers Prayer Children include Nishiki, a buff Koi fish, and Bampuku, an enormous fluffy warrior chef cat.</p>


<p>Due to the variety of characters, and the tremendous quantity of build customisations each possible team provides, the loadout options prior to a run can be overwhelming. On the plus side, there’s always a new approach to try when you run up against the inevitable brick wall of a particularly nasty boss. Get the combination of characters and abilities just right – perhaps more by luck and experimentation rather than skilful intention – and it’s undeniably satisfying to wipe the floor with a previously untouchable boss. However, this delight is tempered by the confusion of never quite getting to grips with the unending variables and the complexity of character builds. The poorly designed menu screens don’t help, making even basic skill upgrades a chore to decipher, let alone navigate through.</p>
<p>Indeed, for an action roguelite, there’s almost too much here, of everything. Fully voiced text conversations between characters go on for an absolute age, with everyone talking a lot but saying very little. A lot of waffle then, the video game equivalent of two lovers refusing to be the first to hang up the phone. Meanwhile, the capability to forge your own swords is comprehensive, offering a level of complexity that would make Kingdom Come: Deliverance II envious. However, some of the forging system also seems… oddly pointless. Why bother tinkering with the appearance of your sword, when it ends up in the hands of an isometric character so small that you can barely even see the thing once in combat? Thankfully, you can just get the local blacksmith to do all the forging for you, benefitting from the stat boosts, whilst also saving on a lot of button bashing QTE’s in the process.</p>

<p>If all the mission preparation is an exhausting drag, it’s in the combat itself that Towa truly shines. Fast and responsive, your fighters look gorgeous as they dash around the environment, unleashing some spectacular screen-covering special attacks. Enemies are fairly dumb, though have enough IQ to seek to overwhelm you with their numbers. As such, controlling the space is key, ensuring you can hit as many foes as possible with every attack, whilst leaving yourself room enough to dart away from any reprisal. In a neat addition, each of your lead character’s two weapons begin to dull as you hack away, requiring you to swap over to the alternative weapon on a regular basis to boost your damage, giving the combat a satisfying rhythmic pace.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, despite not being able to directly control your partner, they still have a health bar and take damage, which feels particularly tight when you can’t get them out of the way of an area attack and thus lose your support spells in the process. This tag-team approach also serves to undermine the local co-op, forcing your partner to take on the role of the support character and restricting their role to casting a couple of spells. As such, they can’t take part in combat directly. This is disappointing, as a more focused co-op mode, one that stands apart from the single player campaign’s tag-team mechanics, would definitely have been welcome.</p>
<p>Even for a roguelite, difficulty spikes can be brutal, certain bosses are sword and spell sponges, whilst annoyingly having the ability to near insta-kill your player character. It forces you to get back to base and tinker with your abilities, settings and unlockables to even stand a chance. Thankfully, if it’s all too much, an easy mode takes the edge off the pain of the difficulty somewhat.</p>

<p>Visually, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree is completely gorgeous. Charismatic character design, phenomenal use of colour, and sumptuous environments make this a real looker of a game. Whilst the dialogue remains over-written and dull throughout, the visual storytelling leads you to connect with each and every member of your team. Which makes the most memorable aspect of Towa also likely its most divisive. As you progress in each run, the characters you choose are gradually sacrificed for the greater good and removed from play. This is both emotionally gutting – Bampuku is too cute and cuddly to die – as well as adding an additional challenge to the game; forcing you to vary up your builds, even in the late game, and demanding you continue to experiment to complete future runs. This is a fascinating addition, one that elevates Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree above being merely ‘inspired-by-Hades’ fodder, into something far more demanding and – most thrillingly – unique.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a fittingly chaotic launch week for <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The cacophony of player feedback ranges from praise for the best new entry in the loot shooter series since <em>Borderlands 2</em> to very loud and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">angry complaints about bugs, crashes, and performance stutters on PC</a>. Even the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions have some weird issues. Gearbox Entertainment now says a second patch to address PC performance is on the way as it also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">investigates problems on console</a>.</p> <p>Not one to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">calmly monitor feedback</a> from atop his 2K Games-funded Ivory Tower, studio CEO Randy Pitchford has been arguing almost nonstop with fans since the game released about whether their gripes about how it runs are legitimate or not. Wit<em>h Borderlands 4</em> sitting at at a mixed rating on Steam with just 65 percent positive reviews, the veteran poster has been handling criticism in classic <em>Borderlands</em> fashion.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Randy is now doing personal tech support for Twitter users and recommending 4x frame gen for a 5080 and telling them to turn off fog which is literally not an option in the game <a href="https://t.co/WzRMiDO8Pt">pic.twitter.com/WzRMiDO8Pt</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s an abridged recap of the post-launch Pitchford timeline:</p> <ul> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650">Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985">Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013">If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution.</a>” – September 13</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">Fun facts: Customer Service reports for Borderlands 4 at roughly 1% or so of installs.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">I have personally helped users go from 30FPS to 90FPS+</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">The game is pretty damn optimal</a>” – September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">Please get a refund from Steam if you aren’t happy with it.</a>”&nbsp;– September 14</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Would you like help tuning with your personal specification?</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1967928069991366700">Turn down or off the volumetric fog</a>”&nbsp;– September 16</li> <li>“<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968388123534180815">Oops. You are correct: the bottom setting for fog is ‘low’ not “off</a>” – September 17</li> </ul> <p>Reactions to this approach have been mixed. “At what point do the crashouts stop making sense?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ni56df/randy_pitchford_code_your_own_engine_and_show_us/">asked</a> one player. Another claiming to be a game industry veteran who was definitely not Pitchford writing under an alias <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1n4ljjl/in_which_i_a_game_industry_veteran_give_sincere/">applauded</a>:” “Randy Pitchford cares. He manically, catastrophically, awkwardly, SINCERELY cares.” I would simply add that <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">this drama is as much a part of <em>Borderlands</em></a> at this point as the bandit psycho masks, terrible Claptrap puns, and glowing ammo hidden in toilets.</p>

 <h2>A second patch to fix <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC is on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shroud's game crashed on Borderlands 4 and cost them all those legendaries RIP😅 <a href="https://t.co/we3m1onoZp">pic.twitter.com/we3m1onoZp</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1968064528052314348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>To help set the record straight or at least cut through the noise a bit, Gearbox released <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">an official statement</a> last night clarifying the team’s ongoing priorities as we approach <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s one-week anniversary. Here are the priorities following an emergency update over the weekend to try to improve optimization on PC:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. <strong>This is our top priority. </strong></li> <li>A Field of View [FOV] slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we’re investigating those with planned updates coming.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The studio also released additional Shift codes for gold keys, including a Break Free Pack, to sweeten the deal with more bonus loot. At least one research firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false">has suggested</a> <em>Borderlands 4</em> has already sold over 2 million copies in its first couple of&nbsp; days. Official player stats from Gearbox indicate 764,733,586 total items looted and 4,563,416 deaths by grenade as well as a quarter of all attempted boss fights being failed. I’m sure at least some of them will blame it on not being able to play <em>Borderlands 4</em> at 120fps in 4K.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 007 First Light Preview: License to Thrill</p>
      </div>
<p>Krogh added that gunplay in 007: First Light is designed to feel fluid and responsive, giving Bond a lethal--and mechanically satisfying--option for when his license to kill is activated. In comparison, using guns in IO's Hitman games carried significant risks, as being caught using a weapon would typically result in Agent 47 having to face off against a small army of persistent foes. Guns also had handling characteristics in the game that were authentic to their real-life counterparts, as recoil, bullet drop-off, and physically aiming a weapon made it somewhat impractical to use them when you could simply frame an assassination as a freak accident instead.</p><p>007: First Light launches on March 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and in case you missed the recent gameplay livestream, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/">14 new things we learned about the James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-has-some-of-the-biggest-levels-that-hitman-dev-has-ever-built/1100-6534477/">how IO built some of its biggest levels yet</a> for its secret agent simulator.

                <p>Borderlands 4 launched on September 12 and it had a massive debut on Steam, eclipsing more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">300,000 concurrent users</a>. The PC edition hasn't been without its issues, though, as players have complained about a range of technical and performance-related problems. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has chimed in as well with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">string of controversial posts on the subject.</a></p><p>Some of the issues are significant enough that Gearbox has already released updates that aimed to improve stability and improvements, while another update is coming today, September 18.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>In a separate post, Gearbox said, "We're reading every piece of feedback you share." In addition to the second PC patch, Gearbox said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gearbox-has-heard-your-borderlands-4-complaints-is-exploring-fov-slider-options-on-console/1100-6534735/" data-ref-id="1100-6534735">field of view (FOV) slider option for consoles</a> is now in testing and more information is coming "very soon" about this. Console players have also reported issues with performance, and Gearbox said it's "investigating those with planned updates coming."</p><p>Gearbox said "millions" of people have played Borderlands 4 so far, but publisher 2K Games has not released any official sales numbers as of yet.</p><p>For comparison, 2019's Borderlands 3 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-3-marks-fastest-selling-2k-game-ever-r/1100-6470015/" data-ref-id="1100-6470015">5 million sell-in sales after its first five days</a> to become 2K's fastest-selling game of all time. Sell-in represents copies sold to retailers, sell-through is copies sold to consumers. </p><p>Borderlands 3 went on to sell-in more than 23 million units, but <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands 2 is the best-selling entry in the franchise overall</a> with more than 30 million units sold. Borderlands 4 still has one more major platform to expand onto, and that'll be the Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

<p>If we build them, they will run</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Asobism's tower defence/roguelite/factory sim title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shapehero-factory">ShapeHero Factory</a>, releases on Switch 2 (and 1) today. Hooray!</p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar, this one sees you create an army of robots from a bunch of magical shapes within a factory setting, making for a sweat-inducing puzzle of sorts as you work to get your automation processes up and running before battle.</p>
<p>The twist? You don't actually get to control the robots you make in the ensuing fight here. Nope, it's all about the factory, levelling up through artefacts and creating more and more powerful units to keep on, er, powering through.</p>
<p>Here's some further — and much more official — details and screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mass-Produce Heroes<br></strong>Transport basic shapes from the scroll to assemble your heroes with different combinations. Circles with triangles will make soldiers, while circles and squares make sprites. Add squares to soldiers to give them shields. Perhaps you could create stronger heroes by combining soldiers together…</p>
<p><strong>Hold the Gates<br></strong>The Great Calamity lies deep within the Book of Magic. To bar your heroes from invading, his forces will come to demolish your gates. Maintain the defense while you forge ever deeper into the book. The servants of The Great Calamity each has its own method of attack, so you must choose the right hero for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Factory-Building and Roguelite Elements Make For Endless Possibilities<br></strong>Obtain rewards from a randomly generated list of options after winning battles.<br>
Will you unlock new artifacts (facilities), or upgrade your existing ones?<br>
As you continue making these tricky decisions, you will create a wholly unique factory!<br>
The choices that each author (playable character) will face as well as the types of heroes that they can create are different, so you need to challenge a different “factory-building” each time you play.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to Grow Stronger<br></strong>The enemies are powerful. With the experience points gained at the end of the game, players can use the Book of Arcane Knowledge to grow permanently stronger. This means that the more you play the game, the stronger you will become.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game left Early Access and went live with version 1.0 just yesterday over on Steam, where it's got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2389040/ShapeHero_Factory/">688 "Very Positive" reviews</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>ShapeHero Factory is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shapehero-factory-switch/">available from the Nintendo eShop for $23.99</a>, or whatever that equates to where you are. It's out on Switch 1, too, for the same price. According to Nintendo's game page, there's no specific upgrade pass for the Switch 1 version (and saves aren't transferable between them). HOWEVER:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the release date, players who own the Nintendo Switch version of this title will be able to obtain the Nintendo Switch 2 version free of charge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to argue with that! We're having trouble finding specific details on what the Switch 2 version does above and beyond Switch 1 - better frame rate and resolution, you'd imagine, especially as the game page suggests a ~400MB file size increase on Switch 2. We'll update you with any details we find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dying-light-the-beast-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-tracing-nvidia-reflex/">confirmed</a> the games getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, DLSS Super Resolution, NVIDIA Reflex and Ray Tracing tech, with Dying Light: The Beast and Gears of War: Reloaded headlining today's additions.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches today, after Techland moved the release date up from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">September 19 launch to today, September 18,</a> and its arriving with full support for a suite of NVIDIA technologies. On top of the aforementioned DLSS 4 Multi-Frame gen, it's also arriving with support for NVIDIA Reflex, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA. NVIDIA claims that players on RTX 50 Series graphics cards can enjoy frame rates multiplied by 7.6X on average with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution enabled while playing the game at 4K.</p>



<p>While 1440p players can enjoy a 5X performance boost if they've got an RTX 5090 in their desktop, making it possible to run the game at "<em>over 400 frames per second</em>." If you don't have a 5090 but you do have an RTX 50 Series card, you can still get the game running at 200+ frames per second, according to NVIDIA, with max settings and ray-tracing enabled.</p>



<p>Dying Light isn't the only game getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen, as Mistfall Hunter enters into its closed beta with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support. It's also joined by Farming Simulator 25, which players can update today to see DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen support go live.</p>



<p>Lastly, Jump Space, a new PvE co-op action game launching into early access tomorrow on September 19 will arrive with support for NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution, and Gears of War: Reloaded is getting an update today to support DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. </p>



<p>The last big batch of games that got support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 and DLSS Super Resolution included the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">Order of Giants DLC from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">10 years ago, Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe sat down with me at E3 2015 and said he'd like to make a new game in the franchise with a time travel mechanic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was, obviously, a long time ago — so long ago that the Nintendo Switch was still only known by its codename NX — but the chat remains one of Tanabe's most forthcoming interviews on the Metroid Prime series' future, discussing the stories of Dark Samus and Phazon, bounty hunter Sylux, and an idea for a new Metroid Prime game that focused on a single planet across multiple points in its timeline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead of broadening it to more planets I would have one and would focus on the timeline, and being able to change that," Tanabe said to me, at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-proper-metroid-prime-would-likely-now-be-on-nx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> at the time. "That's one interesting idea I have in mind... but I understand many people thought that [Echoes] was too difficult."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By evoking Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Tanabe is referring to its dual-world gameplay that saw players shift between light and dark versions of the same space — a concept that prompted a mix of reactions from players. Still, the idea of time travel appears to have stuck with Tanabe, who has once again returned as the producer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> — a game which contains other similarities to the concept he discussed back then. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take the bounty hunter Sylux, for example, a character that even fans of the Metroid Prime trilogy might struggle to remember. A rival of Samus, Sylux was introduced in the Nintendo DS spin-off game Metroid Prime Hunters (for which Tanabe was also a producer). As part of the same interview a decade ago, Tanabe confirmed the spaceship seen during the cliffhanger tease at the end of Metroid Prime 3 belonged to Sylux, potentially setting up a rivalry in a future game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was Sylux, another hunter from Metroid Prime Hunters at the end of Metroid Prime 3," Tanabe said to me at the time. "Personally I'd like to create a story centring around Sylux and Samus."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, roll forward a decade and Sylux is indeed a major presence in Metroid Prime 4 — and last week the character was even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-amiibo-where-to-buy">announced as getting an amiibo figurine</a>, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the idea of a game featuring time travel, fans have long held onto Tanabe's suggestion — and even pointed to the black hole shape seen in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's logo in the hope that it might mean Samus can create some kind of time-dilating space hole to travel into the past or future.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, supposedly leaked box art for the game posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1njugon/metroid_prime_4_japanese_promotional_case/netbjid/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> appears to mention Samus as being stuck on the game's planet of Viewros after being transported across space and <em>time </em>— prompting more chatter that time travel, just like Sylux, has remained part of Tanabe's plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm assuming it'll work exactly like how Dark Aether works in Prime 2," wrote Metroid fan Spinjitsuninja on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1jldbti/how_do_we_think_prime_4_could_implement_time/mk2xs16/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, before the supposed box art leaked. "We see several portals in the recent trailer anyways, so unless those are awkward warp points, I think it shows similar world design. They could always have the game take you to different eras, with more than two 'worlds' to go between? But that might be ambitious."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Calling it now: you have to hit a certain speed on the bike to time travel, back to the future style," added another fan, Gleethor on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-releases-december-4-2025.1295940/page-34#post-145309569" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Could even see it near instantly changing the landscape around you when you time travel, which could certainly explain why it's relatively sparse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-has-a-release-date-while-samus-has-a-motorbike">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer finally revealed the game's release date</a> and also showcased a new open-world motorbike for Samus, though the video felt something of a low-key showing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">within the wider Nintendo Direct</a>. Here's hoping we get to see more of the game before its December 7, 2025 release date — if only we could time travel to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

			<p>Sonic’s kart racing series should have usurped that red dungaree-wearing handyman years ago. This is a character whose very reason for existing is to go fast, while Nintendo’s portly plumber would only really be rushing to deal with a nasty water leak. However, that’s not the case. While Mario Kart is a literal system seller, the Sonic Racing series tends to drift into second place, a valiant effort, but one which can’t make its speedy hero quite fast enough. Can Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds be different?</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Come Race on Our Level Commercial" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYOfP1a7xjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds feels as though someone saw Ratchet &amp; Clank’s dimension-hopping mechanic and decided to borrow it for a racing game. After the first lap of each race the leader can choose the CrossWorlds track, shifting the action to a completely different zone and introducing a random element into the mix. You might be zipping along through one of Sonic’s casino tracks when suddenly you’re transported to a watery pirate world, or flying through the air above a glorious technicolour meadow.</p>


<p>In theory, it’s an interesting idea, but in practice, it doesn’t give you the same sense of wonder that you might expect, serving instead to take away from the sense of racing on a single track, perfecting the racing line or finding shortcuts, and besting your opponent. It’s just… a bit random, and this is a racing game that already has a lot going on. That’s compounded by many of the tracks just not being all that engaging, and for all that they’re drawing on Sonic’s back catalogue, they might just show that Sonic’s levels aren’t all that interesting…</p>


<p>There’s multiple mechanics at work in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and the Gadget Plate gives you a level of customisation to tailor your kart to your particular preferences. Each Gadget alters your kart’s performance in some way, giving you additional boosts or upgrading specific weaponry to give you an edge against the cavalcade of characters that fill out the game’s roster. They introduce an element of customisation that’s clearly a bit unbalanced, with Gadgets turned off for online modes just days before the game released, but they certainly add something interesting to your offline loadout.</p>
<p>That customisation extends to your vehicle as well. Having definitely looked over the fence into Mario’s garage, you can now select different front and rear parts and alternate tyres for your kart. These also alter your kart’s performance, as well as giving you a dose of visual flair to play around with, letting you customise the colour scheme and add decals too.</p>
<p>It’s an odd mix of decals, filled with gaming partners like ROG and MSI, but then with Air Asia and Beyblade ones too. It’s nice to have the option, but it feels a bit half-baked, with decals unable to be stacked or placed on the side of your car, and if you change any of the parts, it completely resets the decals for that section. The result? You’ll probably give up on decals.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, the shift from Sonic and Sega All-Stars to Sonic Racing means that this is a character roster largely made up of the hedgehog’s pals, rather than from the wider Sega lineup, and it’s a real shame. Sure, we’ve got Hatsune Miku at launch, with Joker and Ichiban coming in a month or two, but the other external characters from Minecraft and SpongeBob – and their associated tracks – are only available as paid DLC, and it’s not out yet.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, beyond Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Robotnik this is a bunch of characters that will probably raise little more than a shrug, even for Sonic fans. OK, I’ll give you Big the Cat, but who wants to play as Charmy the Bee?</p>
<p>That contributes to an overall lack of charm. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is certainly bright and colourful, and there’s the odd cheesy Sonic song, backtalking between rivals, and the occasional track that really stands out, but it feels relatively lifeless next to Mario’s last two karting outings. Sonic Racing Transformed was a real celebration of Sonic and the Sega brand, but this just lacks the same soul.</p>

<p>It does at least provide a fairly decent dose of karting. Drifting for speed boosts, performing rapid tricks and flips in the air, and battling it out with rivals can easily have you on the edge of your seat, and as you’d hope, playing with others in multiplayer only makes that stronger. It is chaotic though, and there’s a sense of unfairness that lurks in each corner. The overall lack of identity extends to the weaponry too, and there’s nothing here that’s as iconic as you’ll find in Mario’s series, or even earlier Sonic racing games.</p>
<p>Besides the regular Grand Prix modes, and the selection of speed classes, there’s also the option of Time Trials and the Race Park, a collection of different racing challenges that’s ideally set up for multiplayer, but can be played solo with an AI team if you want. They mostly mess with the formula a bit, so you can race in a team where hitting your teammates gives you both a burst of speed, or a multiplayer battle race where your team have to get the most item hits in. They’re an OK diversion, but they only really serve to emphasise the chaos of the races. I soon headed back to the regular Grand Prix.</p>

<p>There’s elements here that do work really well, from the customisation of the Gadget Plate and your kart to the Jukebox that lets you mix and match your racing soundtrack. Fundamentally though, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds biggest problem is that it doesn’t feel like it rewards you for racing well. Rivals shoot off into the distance, never to be seen again, while rubber banding keeps everyone bunched up behind you. That’s not fun, it’s frustrating, and no amount of dimension hopping and DLC characters can cover that up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a number of grand mysteries laid out before you in the opening hours of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">which I previewed last month</a>. Who, exactly, are you? Why have you been trapped in torpor for the last century? Who is this voice that’s in your head? And is there any saving Seattle’s vampire community as the Prince is murdered and everyone suddenly struggles for power?</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of these mysteries are quickly unpeeled –&nbsp;Phyre, your player character, is a legendary Elder Vampire known to many as the Nomad, while Fabien, the voice in your head, was until very recently a PI, who’s been indelibly bonded into Phyre’s mind at the time of his death –&nbsp;while others are deepened as the politics, backstabbing and coterie of characters starts to come to the fore.</p>


<p>Our second hands on with Vampire: The Masquerade –&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 picks up right after where we left off with our first, but it’s still a sudden change of pace. You see, instead of playing as Phyre, I suddenly find myself as Fabian, who’s been called in by the club’s owner to meet with Pandora. Pandora, though, has been murdered in a particularly grizzly fashion in the club’s backroom, staked on lengths of rebar and with her head ripped off.</p>
<p>Exploring the scene highlights plenty that’s odd or wrong about this, but there’s something nagging at the back of Fabian’s mind. As he engages his Malkavian abilities to gain more insight, he’s bounced back even further to when he was a baby of a vampire in the 1920s, and an eerily similar murder of a cigarette girl, scouring this site now for clues to take back to his sire and the sheriff of the time.</p>


<p>I love this layered narrative approach, and while the opening hours of Bloodlines 2 are clearly rather guided to get you into the story, I’m really keen to see how the ties between different time periods and the mystery wrapped around Phyre and Fabian continues to unfold.</p>
<p>Brought back to the present as Phyre wakes up –&nbsp;this was just a dream of Fabian’s memories, it turns out –&nbsp;and there’s more pressing matters at hand. The new Prince has one especially troublesome thorn in their side that you might be able to help with, as Sheriff Benny has gone completely rogue and gone on a bloody rampage across Seattle to kill anyone he deems to be too inferior –&nbsp;Thinbloods and Ghouls, in other words. Would you mind helping out, and maybe the Prince will let you stick around in the city?</p>
<p>There’s a clear lead we can take here, trying to trace Benny to his usual hangout, a garage in a corner of town, which is being staked out by the Anarch Ghouls that he’s been waging his single vampire war against. It’s here that we find Benny’s own Sire, a surprisingly young-looking vampire who brought the tempestuous Benny into the fold, way back when. We’re able to use dialogue and persuasion to get him to open up, convince him that Benny needs to be caught and brought back to the Prince to face justice, while learning a bit about Benny’s personality along the way. Can we catch up to Benny and bring him in without a fight?</p>
<div id="attachment_462937"><p id="caption-attachment-462937">Not Anarchs, but these are enemies.</p></div>
<p>The trail takes us to a building site, once again surrounded by Anarchs, and with a clear bloody trail that Benny’s left behind him as he’s been both hunter and hunted, and plenty inconveniences in my way to catch up to him. On this occasion I specced up Phyre as a Tremere, able to use blood sorcery for long-range attacks, and rapid hit and run strikes and it was immediately a lot of fun trying to figure out and plan how I was using my abilities, saving up and spending blood charges earned from draining enemies while taking them out – easier when being sneaky, but vital when in the thick of combat to also restore health.</p>
<p>I leant on three key abilities during this, with Recall letting me place a warp point somewhere safe that I could teleport back to after striking at an enemy, perhaps gliding across or dropping from above before fading away. At the same time, I could cast a Blood Curse on an enemy so that they explode the next time that they take damage, which is hugely useful for taking out tougher enemies, but comes with a time cost to cast at longer distances and when they have higher health. Still, cursing someone from a distance and then hitting them with a brick was eminently satisfying. Finally, Cauldron of Blood could paralyse and fix an enemy in place, screaming from the torment, which is great for temporarily thinning out a group of enemies or letting you close a gap.</p>
<div id="attachment_462938"><p id="caption-attachment-462938">The Blood Curse ability in action.</p></div>
<p>Working through a string of combat encounters, I really enjoyed stringing these together, scrapping through moments that didn’t go quite to plan, and happening across some fun surprises. You know, things like being able to pick up guns – using telekinesis, of course, because who’d want to touch a gun? – and blast away at enemies. It makes a nice change from yeeting bricks.</p>
<p>It built up to a big battle with Benny, having failed to talk him down, and here using a mix of Cauldron of Blood to freeze him in place to I could Blood Curse him was massively effective. Alas, I never quite had the chance to grab guns of any Anarchs that dropped in to interfere with our fight.</p>

<p>With Benny brought low once more, the narrative side of the game could kick in once more. Katsumi, the leader of the Anarchs stepped out of the shadows demanding that Benny be left to face their own justice, and after wriggling my way through that, the Prince saw fit to offer me a job.</p>
<p>It’s at this point that the game will really open up and, while I could have explored Seattle before this point, the narrative will look to take advantage of the open world setting. While it might not play into the specific fantasies that the original Bloodlines did, of creating your own character and navigating this world as a Thinblood, I can’t deny that I’ve enjoyed exploring this character of Phyre, their inherent power and some contrasting abilities and combat styles, and the narrative possibilities that Fabian offers. There’s just around a month to go before the full game’s release on 21st October, but I’m looking forward to venturing into the snow-blanketed nights of Seattle.</p>

						<h5>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h5><p><span>September 25, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch; Nintendo Switch 2 later in 2025</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Sonic may not need a car to get around, but a hedgehog has to rest his feet from time to time, and Sega's mascot has amassed a fairly hearty collection of racing games over the years. While most of these racers have struggled to escape the shadow of a certain mustachioed rival's racing efforts, a few have managed to stand on their own and carve out respectable fanbases. Now, only a few months after the big release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the blue guy is also hitting the asphalt again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>



<p>Is this one of Sonic's more successful turns behind the wheel? Or is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds an easy one to cross off your list? Read on to get up to speed...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds mostly sticks to the modern mascot-racer formula, with vehicles that seamlessly transform whether they're on land, water, or in the air, a large collection of different items to frustrate your opponents with, and a focus on earning boosts by drifting around corners and doing tricks.</p>



<p>Past Sonic kart racers differentiated themselves a bit by offering somewhat more realistic driving physics, but that largely goes out the window with CrossWorlds. This game’s vehicles don’t feel like they have much weight or momentum as you take corners, with even Mario Kart's vehicles feeling like they have more inertia. To be clear, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's controls are perfectly responsive; they're just very arcade-y and can take some time to get used to. Thankfully, the game still delivers a proper Sonic-like sense of speed, with even races played on standard middle-of-the-road speed settings feeling pretty peppy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players also have some new freedom to customize their rides and abilities (yes, characters and vehicles are now chosen separately). Prior to races, players can mix and match vehicle parts and a variety of "gadgets" that offer an array of buffs. The latter goes deeper than the former, as there are a fairly limited number of vehicle parts, but around 70 gadgets that can alter your racing experience in sometimes rather novel ways.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's array of items are very derivative of recent Mario Karts -- the red and green boxing gloves are just Red and Green Shells, the Blue Wisp is a Mushroom, the drill-like Yellow Wisp is a Bullet Bill, and so on. But hey, Mario Kart's items are generally pretty fun and well-balanced, so, by extension, this game's items are also pretty fun and well-balanced. While you will get those occasional moments when a sure victory is snatched away mere feet from the finish line, I didn't find CrossWorld’s weapons too overbearing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Much like Mario Kart World before it, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is somewhat fixated on changing the way individual races and Grand Prix cups are constructed. After completing the first lap of a race, whoever is in first chooses between two Travel Ring portals, upon which all racers jump to a CrossWorld track with a totally different theme for the second lap. Sometimes, these CrossWorlds will even have a Frenzy modifier attached, which may make the lap more difficult, or simply more intense, by doing things like flooding the course with warp rings. For the third lap, you return to your original course, although you’ll find it's now been modified with new hazards, shortcuts, and other changes. Each Grand Prix offers three unique courses, with the fourth race consisting of a single lap from the previous three races smashed together.</p>



<p>The CrossWorld gimmick is a neat-enough trick (albeit one that’s pretty much directly lifted from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart/">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) and it does introduce some unpredictability to races. That said, while there are 24 regular tracks in the game, there are only 15 CrossWorlds, and in my experience, certain ones came up more often than others to the point they become a bit over-familiar.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of over-familiar, there’s no getting around the fact that Sonic Team was doing some heavy cribbing from Nintendo, particularly Mario Kart 8, when designing this game’s courses. While Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's tracks are perhaps a bit narrower, their loopy, gravity-defying designs are <em>very</em> Mario Kart 8, and many of the themes feel almost directly copy-pasted — here's the treetop track, here's the spooky track, here's the dinosaur track, and so on. It's honestly a bit shameless and makes Sega's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-calls-out-mario-kart-in-new-trailer-ahead-of-launch/">revive their old "Genesis does what Nintendon't" era marketing tactics</a> for CrossWorlds a bit questionable. More like Sega does what Nintendid a decade ago, amirite?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>‎That said, all snark aside, while they're a bit obvious in their inspiration, Sonic Racing: CrossWorld's courses aren't <em>bad</em>. Quite the opposite, really. Mario Kart 8 is a great game, so it's a good source to take notes from. CrossWorld's tracks are intense, sometimes trippy, and fairly visually impressive (a move to Unreal Engine 5 mostly pays off, with only occasional stutters when approaching Travel Rings on PS5). In fact, I’d wager some of the folks disappointed by the more open and breezy approach of Mario Kart World may appreciate these Mario-Kart-8-flavored courses, particularly when combined with CrossWorld’s amped-up sense of speed. Ironically, Sega is offering an alternative to Nintendo by cribbing from Nintendo's own past.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, while Sonic keeps pace with Mario pretty well when it comes to on-road action, CrossWorlds lags behind pretty badly when it comes to content and ways to play. Unlike many earlier Sonic racers, there's no story mode here, with Grand Prix being pretty much your only single-player option. With only 8 cups available at launch, you'll be able to see most of what Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has to offer within 3 or 4 hours. Of course, there are different speed classes, difficulty levels, time trials, mirror tracks, and a roster of rivals to best, but it all comes down to replaying CrossWorld’s somewhat modest collection of tracks and Grand Prix cups over and over. The Race Park multiplayer mode allows teams of players to tackle races with various extra objectives attached (collect the most coins, etc.) but this is just more somewhat transparent remixing of the same limited content.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>More Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds racers, vehicles, and courses are coming, but almost all of it, particularly the crossover content featuring the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants and others, is locked behind a $20 season pass. Of course, racing game season passes are nothing new, but it's hard not to be a bit put off given how quickly the core game races to the finish line.</p>

					<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2>

						<section>
				<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/loving-hollow-knight-silksong-play-these-six-metroidvania-games-next</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/loving-hollow-knight-silksong-play-these-six-metroidvania-games-next.1301391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a> finally released this month after years of teasing and development (can you believe a build was playable at E3 2019?). This is a game so anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">it broke the Nintendo eShop the morning it launched</a>, with countless players praising <em>Silksong's</em> gameplay, challenge, and boss battles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But once the credits roll, you might find yourself craving even more Metroidvania exploration, and we have some recommendations to help fill that hole. Here are six Metroidvanias we recommend checking out if you loved <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong!&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2><em>Metroid Dread</em></h2>

<p>Though it's silly to call a <em>Metroid</em> or a <em>Castlevania</em> game a Metroidvania when the genre is named after these titles,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-dread" rel="nofollow">Metroid Dread</a></em> is one of the strongest games that the series has seen in recent memory. The best-selling <em>Metroid </em>game of all time, <em>Metroid Dread</em> brings players into the action immediately and does an incredible job of allowing you to explore organically without overly guiding you.</p>

<p>Where other Metroidvanias can feel a little overwhelming, <em>Metroid Dread</em> is manageable and gives you a steady drop of powerups and upgrades to keep the gameplay interesting and the story moving. If you haven't checked out this Nintendo Switch <em>Metroid</em> game yet, especially ahead of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Beyond</em>, we recommend picking it up.</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metroid-dread-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Dread</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>An excellent title that came out just last year,<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown" rel="nofollow">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a></em>&nbsp;is a refreshing take on the franchise. This sprawling Metroidvania not only boasts colorful and beautiful art direction, but it also gives players crisp controls that make the many platforming sections and boss battles feel very intuitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> also offers some much-appreciated accessibility options, like a Guided Mode that can highlight where your next objective is. If you prefer the classic Metroidvania feel, though, Exploration Mode is the right choice for you. For a super fun, accessible experience that gives you plenty of upgrades and accessories to equip along the way, be sure to check out <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space" rel="nofollow"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Animal Well</em></h2>

<p>Many of the Metroidvania games we recommend you play after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>fall into the 2.5D HD category, but <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-well" rel="nofollow">Animal Well</a></em>&nbsp;is a deviation that fits securely into the 2D space. Beautiful pixel art and inspiring level design come together to form this experience that quickly became a fan favorite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Animal Well</em> is designed with layers of puzzles and secrets, though how deep the player descends into these secrets is mostly up to the individual. Many of the items collected have multiple uses, and the explored rooms can offer multiple connections to keep you guessing and working through puzzles during the entire experience.<em> Animal Well</em> exists with minimal exposition, giving the player the opportunity to fully explore and enjoy this world on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Well</em> review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>The sequel to 2015's <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ori-and-will-of-wisps" rel="nofollow">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a> </em>came along in 2020 and expanded on the original's Metroidvania concepts. Set against artfully designed backdrops with adorably drawn creatures, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps </em>offers an impressively intuitive platforming experience with movement mechanics that are extremely fun to master.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With responsive sword combat and a host of skills and upgrades that make <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> a joy to play, this game provides plenty to love for Metroidvania fans looking for their next experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ori-and-will-of-wisps-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>A true <em>Castlevania</em> spiritual successor (developed by Koji Igarashi, who previously worked on every Metroidvania installment in the franchise), <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night </em>stands out in a crowded segment. If you enjoyed <em>Symphony of the Night</em>, many of the elements carry over to this title, with countless secrets to uncover and a litany of items to collect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players will find a sprawling, meticulously designed castle and engaging combat awaiting them if they choose to check out <em>Ritual of the Night</em>. Fluid gameplay and engaging boss battles come together to make an experience that you won't soon forget. If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has you craving more excellent game design,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>is an excellent choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-review-iga-to-please" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em> Review</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Axiom Verge 2&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Sequel to 2015's <em>Axiom Verge</em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/axiom-verge-2" rel="nofollow">Axiom Verge 2</a> </em>builds on its predecessor by offering impressively detailed biomes to explore and a variety of upgrades to pick up along the way. The pixelation of the world doesn't take away from any of its beauty—in fact it adds to it—and the fluid gameplay allows you to effortlessly explore and uncover the secrets awaiting you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many Metroidvania games focus on the strengths of a single character, <em>Axiom Verge 2 </em>offers players both a human form and a drone form that they can transform into, unlocking additional traversing capabilities.

He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Corsair wasn’t joking around when it named the new $99.99 Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless gaming mouse. At 36 grams, it weighs just a bit more than seven US nickels. Is that <em>too </em>light? Maybe. Most of Corsair’s competitors haven’t shipped a mouse much below 50 grams (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/757680/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-headset-keyboard-mouse-hands-on">Sony’s new Inzone mouse</a> is 48 grams). I could flick it across my desk with relative ease, and that’s the point of lightweight mice. The Sabre V2 Pro is made to be easy to move so players can more quickly react in fast-paced games.</p><p>Even so, it doesn’t seem like Corsair cut too many corners to reduce the weight. The company claims its tiny 210mAh battery can last up to 70 hours per charge over a 2.4GHz wireless connection with its default 1,000Hz polling rate. The Sabre V2 Pro also supports 8,000Hz polling, letting your PC register a movement or input at 0.125ms, but battery life will dive to just 16 hours per charge in that mode. Peripheral makers love to brag about 8,000Hz polling, but most people’s reaction speeds aren’t anywhere close to sub-millisecond sensitivity, so you can probably save your battery.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro has a symmetrical shape, but is built for right-handed for PC gamers, with two thumb buttons on its left side. Corsair includes grip tape that can be applied to the main buttons and to the sides to customize how it feels to hold.</p><p>Tweaking this mouse’s DPI, macros, and other settings won’t require a software installation. Corsair is launching a browser-based configurator for the Sabre V2 Pro. This is slowly becoming the norm with PC gaming accessories geared toward pros. Allowing access to settings via a browser makes it easy to quickly make adjustments from any internet-connected PC, which makes them more useful during tournament play.</p><p>The Sabre V2 Pro is available now in black or white.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776782/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-ultralight-gaming-mouse-weight-specs-price]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items.1301385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic is continuing its attempts to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a platform that’s bigger than just battle royale — this time by giving creators the ability to make and sell in-game items. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">Starting in December</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to sell items directly from the islands they’ve built, using new tools that will be launching later on.</p><p>The benefit, of course, is that creators on the platform will have a new revenue stream (currently, they earn revenue primarily based on engagement numbers). And Epic says that they’ll normally earn “50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands,” though through 2026 that number will temporarily be at 100 percent presumably to encourage developers to take part. As for what “V-Bucks value” entails, well, it’s a complicated calculation.</p><p>Here’s Epic’s explanation:</p><div><blockquote><p>To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite’s average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.</p></blockquote></div><p>In terms of actually creating these items, Epic says that creators will be able to utilize “a Verse-based API and new UEFN tools to create and offer purchasable durable items and consumable items in their games,” and that details are coming “soon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, in November Epic will be adding a “sponsored” row to <em>Fortnite</em>’s discover feed, which will let creators spend money for increased visibility for their islands. Also coming is a community tool that will let creators speak more directly to players for sharing updates and soliciting feedback.</p><p>Notably, Epic says that it will be taking a cut of both the sponsored row and user-created item sales because it has been “operating the business at a loss.” The developer explains that “This model will enable Epic to cover the costs of servicing the <em>Fortnite</em> ecosystem. The funds that don’t go back to creators contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&amp;D and other operating expenses.”</p><div><p>Today’s announcement is just the latest in a string of updates meant to expand <em>Fortnite</em> from a single, massively popular shooter to a platform for games, much like Roblox. Things really kicked off at the end of 2023 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">the launch of Epic-made games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em> and <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>, and since then the developer has added new creators tools like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">the ability to make first-person shooters</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader">the introduction of AI characters</a>.</p></div><p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349588/epic-paid-fortnite-creators-a-total-of-352m-in-2024">Epic said that it had paid out $352 million to creators in 2024</a>, with user-made games accounting for more than 36 percent of time spent in <em>Fortnite</em>. Today the company said that it had paid out a total of $722 million to date.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/780819/fortnite-creators-sell-items]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-still-manages-to-be-a-great-kart-racer-in-the-face-of-crossover-slop.1301379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-mario-kart-preview-shadow-2000620065"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>, the latest entry in the blue blur’s kart racing spin-off series, has a core conceit that Sonic, his friends, and his enemies are racing through portals to other tracks, and they might not always be in their own universe when they reach the other side. I’ve been enjoying my time with </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>a whole lot, but I’ve only been playing as my favorite boy, Shadow the Hedgehog, and even after I unlock crossover characters like Hatsune Miku, SpongeBob SquarePants, and </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s Joker, I still won’t stray far from the hedgehog I showed up for. Though I haven’t gotten to put much time into online play during the review period, I played a fair bit of it during the beta and had a blast with its fast-paced but strategic racing. I just wish </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> wasn’t also the latest example of corporate IP consolidation, when </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>’s signature, stylish flair more than carries it past the finish line.</span></p> <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has certainly exacerbated my crossover fatigue, but even though it has become the quintessential example of a video game dumping every IP its owners can afford into one big pot of sludge, my distaste for the act of tossing a bunch of unrelated characters and references into one game definitely predates Epic’s battle royale. I was annoyed when the fighting game </span><i><span>Injustice 2 </span></i><span>incorporated the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles while concept art for the warlock Constantine was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/INJUSTICE/comments/kyevbw/official_injustice_2_concept_art_for_constantine/"><span>gathering dust on a NetherRealm Studios server</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale </span></i><span>was packed with playable ads for upcoming games in its line-up, while major players in PlayStation history were nowhere to be seen. That’s really all the influx of crossovers is these days: ads; cynical reminders that the things we like aren’t so divided as they once were. Where once we might occasionally see Freddy and Jason fight or Timmy Turner and Jimmy Neutron trade lives, now we get a lot of cosmetics that are low-effort references to other worlds, all thrown together without rhyme or reason and almost always featuring nods to other IPs that you can also go spend money on.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000626585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626585"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626585">© Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i><span> is stuffed with guest characters and crossover tracks, and it doesn’t escape my notice that almost every crossover here involves either a Sega or Paramount property. Unlike the core </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters, these racers don’t have voice actors to spout any pre-race rival banter or make any sorts of exclamations when they do sick tricks or get pummeled by a competing racer’s rocket-powered boxing glove. In other words, these crossover characters are mostly just props placed in karts or on hoverboards to remind you that there are games or television shows you could be consuming other than the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>game you’re currently playing.</span></p>

 <p><span>The shame of all these efforts to remind people that other games exist is that when you cut through all the distraction, you find that </span><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </span></i><span>is an absolutely delightful and deep kart racer that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-trailer-mario-kart-world-nintendo-sega-rivarlry-2000626017"><span>outpaces some of its contemporaries</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>is at its best when it’s leaning into its own legacy, rather than gesturing at others. Its pre-race rival exchanges when you’re playing single-player modes and are pitted against a skilled, intelligent PC racer have some of the best one-on-one interactions much of its large roster has ever had in the series’ long history. Meanwhile, its race tracks pull from decades of </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>games past, and feel like a grand tour through different eras of the franchise with some banger tunes to accompany them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Part of me got a bit sentimental racing around as Shadow and seeing several homages to him specifically, such as tracks based on Radical Highway, his iconic first level from </span><i><span>Sonic Adventure 2</span></i><span>, and one based on his version of the White Space from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><i><span>Shadow Generations</span></i></a><span>. It’s like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851"><span>Year of Shadow</span></a><span> never ended. Riding my sick, decked-out hoverboard on these stages was an absolute joy, until I saw motherfucking Hatsune Miku or Joker pull up next to me. Thus far, none of </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ announced DLC characters are from </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>games, TV, or movies, and as I see characters like Pac-Man and Steve coming down the pipeline, I’m left wondering where some more niche </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>characters are, like Infinite from </span><i><span>Sonic Forces </span></i><span>or, to really swing for the fences, someone like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-human-characters-tom-maddy-agent-stone-1851745037"><span>Agent Stone from the live-action movies</span></a><span>. Do you know how cool it would be to have one of the best characters to come out of those movies show up in a multiverse game? There’s already so much fan art of him in the games’ style, Sega. Skip the Ninja Turtles and get Lee Majdoub in the booth.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000626586" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626586"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626586">© Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to spend this entire write-up dunking on the crossover nonsense because when I get past that, </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> is a truly exhilarating, challenging, and complex racer that deserves a lot of credit for its systems. Though it is a bit faster than, and not as weighty as, something like </span><i><span>Mario Kart</span></i><span>, its Gadget mechanic, which lets you customize your vehicles with different perks, is a real game-changer. My go-to kit is one that gives me a Monster Truck item at the start of the race, so I can crush half the racers under a giant wheel, then another perk that gives me a boost every time I collide with an enemy, meaning that no one can knock me off the track and into the abyss; instead, if they try, they just end up slingshotting me forward as I leave them in the dust. Choice is at the heart of </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ racing systems, whether you’re choosing between a kart and a hoverboard or tweaking your gadgets to personalize your playstyle.</span></p> <p><span>Those ideas are what elevate </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>to one of </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span>’s best spin-offs in recent memory. The game is best when it’s focusing on being an extremely fun </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racer, rather than a billboard for other games and TV shows. </span></p>
