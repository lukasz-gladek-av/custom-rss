            <p>Someone deep in the bowels of the internet once betwittered that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> was "the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> of RPGs". The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-early-access-review">back in 2016</a>. I didn't know it would take another nine years to bring this ambitiously hostile Finnish life simulator to a full release. But here it is. If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.</p>

<p>It's a wonderfully leery game. You have a button to piss, and another button dedicated to giving people the middle finger. You can get into rally races and mess up everything in the car you've spent the last few hours fixing. If you are emotionally broken and fall instantly in love with games that do not care about you as a person, then you will probably be head-over-heels for this.</p>
<p>Yet it is at least <em>slightly</em> more forgiving compared to its original release. You start with more food than a single pack of sausages, for example, and car parts no longer wear down over time but last forever. There's also a bus to prevent you getting stranded in the middle of nowhere when you run out of fuel - something that happened to me at least once in early access. </p><p>Other stuff has changed. There's a stress meter now, a moped to drive, and many new neighbours, farms, and factories to visit throughout the map. This includes at least one dude who'll gamble with you over a card game. I'm getting all this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDQBYcWoLEA">a handy video</a> which lists all the differences, great and small. I haven't actually played the latest version. I am too afraid. Reviewing this scrappy monster is a task I both dread and crave. </p>
<p>Developers AmisTech Games once <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/516750/view/2220784205327276971?l=english">quietly mentioned</a> plans for a snowy sequel called My Winter Car. Getting the battered old summer beaut out the door was the priority, but the dev has recently confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/516750/view/514071031546120457?snr=1_5_9_">an update post</a> that the sequel is still in "active development". If you're really impatient, there's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/2563">a wintry mod that jumped the gun</a>, adding snowy weather and other cold elements to the game. </p>
<p>If you're still wondering if this sim is as unusual as it seems from that trailer, you can get a taste of its bleak wackiness from various patch notes over the last nine years. Here are some of the best:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>You might now die from urinating into wrong places</li>
<li>Grandma might now want to get a ride to the church</li>
<li>Grandma now pays less if you have a prison tattoo</li>
<li>If Player passes out from drunkenness while having active Jail sentence he is transported back to Jail</li>
<li>Added TV to Jail</li>
<li>Cousin might now end up as your cellmate</li>
<li>Hangover is now best to be dealt with drinking alcohol</li>
<li>Jumping up from lowest crouch position is now an exercise method</li>
<li>Added lottery</li>
<li>Urine now accumulates if player keeps urinating on the house floor</li>
<li>Added Teletext to TV, use remote control to operate</li>
<li>You can now grill food on top of a hot Satsuma engine</li>
<li>Moose meat can be eaten after it has been grilled, similarly to fish</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And if you're still not convinced, marvel at <a href="http://www.amistech.com/msc/">the developer's website</a>. It is a thing of horrific beauty.</p></div>

<p>Balatro’s best Seeds allow you to experience the exhilarating moments of high-scoring hands more frequently. They are broken, overpowered Seeds with the potential to rack up ridiculous scores. Plus, you can conquer the later stages of Balatro’s insanely tough Endurance Mode with the right setup.</p>



<p>I find the first Blind to be the calm before the storm. It’s you, a default stack of 52 equally distributed cards (depending on your chosen deck), and a small points total to hit. You can throw out a couple of Flushes, one-shot the Blind with a Straight, or begin with a Royal Flush. Then, the Shop throws one random assortment of goodies after another at you. This is how a conventional run of Balatro is.</p>



<p>In a Seeded run, everything is different, so let’s delve into the awesomeness of a Seeded run and why they’re so fun in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best indie game of 2024</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-a-seeded-run-in-balatro">What is a Seeded Run in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>A Seeded Run allows you to replicate a previously played game of Balatro by following the exact moves as the Seeded run’s initial playthrough.</strong></p>



<p>Why would you do this I hear you ask? Because it’s <em>fun</em>, and certain runs are filed under “Seen only to be believed.” Meaning, the set of Jokers and circumstances during a run were almost miraculous. Excessive Chip tallies, outrageous Multipliers, and enough fire beneath the points values to melt the North Pole in seconds.</p>



<p>Your entire run is predetermined if you follow the steps of the player who registered the initial run. Doing this is difficult if you don’t have the precise steps though. You are bound to deviate, but a dreamy run lies dormant if you play your cards right.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-seeded-run-in-balatro">How to Play Seeded Run in Balatro</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Ante gets out of hand very quickly. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Enter a correct Seed Code on Balatro’s “Enter Seed” screen and press to begin the game.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple to do, and I’ve broken down the process with an easy step-by-step guide below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Balatro’s home screen.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Play</strong>.</li>



<li>Select <strong>New Run</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the <strong>Seeded Run</strong> circle next to “Play.”</li>



<li>If it now has a Red Tick, click <strong>Enter Seed</strong>.</li>



<li>Correctly enter a Seed—such as the nine I gave you above.</li>



<li>Hit <strong>Play </strong>to begin.</li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking Balatro is one of the joys offered by developer LocalThunk. Share your best runs below, and if possible, throw in some more Seeds, explain what you did, and they might end up in our guide in a future update!</p>

            <p>
The ongoing deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks continues today with purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards, a report that Nintendo's new console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock, and speculation over the new handheld's mysterious optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Let's begin with those MicroSD Express listings, which look to be have been spotted by a GameStop employee and posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">reddit</a>. These include Switch 2-branded MicroSD Express card variants in the already-existing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORwmO">256GB</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YLvk">512GB</a> sizes, which sell for around £40 and £50 respectively. 
</p>
<p>
SD Express is a newer standard for SD cards with much faster transfer speeds, enabling performance not dissimilar to SSDs. If the Switch 2 is indeed adopting this standard, it'll be interesting to see how the console performs with multiplatform games versus current gen consoles with SSD memory.
</p>
<p>
Moving on to word of compatibility with the Switch 1 dock, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say">IGN</a> has been told by Switch 2 accessories manufacturer Genki that Nintendo's new console won't fit the older base.
</p>
<p>
While the Switch 2 itself can physically fit within the Switch 1 dock, "indentations" in its design have been added to ensure users don't actually plug it in. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">The Verge</a> has been told by Genki CEO Eddie Tsai that the Switch 2's mysterious new optical sensor - located on its Joy-Con - could offer mouse-like functionality when paired with another attachment. The concept sounds similar to Lenovo's Legion Go handheld, which also features Joy-Con like controllers.
</p>
<p>
When paired with a base, the Legion Go controllers can stand upright and act like a vertically-aligned mouse - almost akin to a joystick.

Nintendo has so far kept schtum on all of its Switch 2 plans, other than stating the new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games and will be fully unveiled before 31st March. 
</p>
<p>
The company has not responded to comment on the now-rampant Switch 2 leaks - many of which have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">fuelled by third-party accessory manufacturers who claim to have access to the console's final design</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a> and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory developers Splash Damage have cancelled Transformers: Reactivate, the Hasbro action game they announced in 2022. They will also be "scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects", and "a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy".</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485">TwiX post</a> in which Splash Damage describe Hasbro as "an incredible and supportive partner", and offer some, by now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">sadly overfamiliar</a> sentiments about this not being a decision they took "lightly". The post doesn't give any reason for the cancellation, beyond this being a "difficult time" for the studio.</p>
<p>There's been little to share about Transformers: Reactivate since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-studio-splash-damage-are-making-a-transformers-action-game">reveal</a>, but the first cinematic trailer (below) paints the picture of a more soulful and seemingly, first-person action game in which the Autobots (good guy Transformers) fight a "Legion" of invading aliens. It would have supported co-op and yes, you would have been able to switch between bot and vehicular forms.</p>

<p>The trailer vibe suggests a grimmer experience than you'd generally get from Transformers, with apocalyptic urban scenes filmed at pedestrian level, and in-game technology that reminds me of Gears Of War. Speaking as a fan of Splash Damage's adaptation work with Gears Tactics, I approve of all this. Shortly after announcement, a social media user <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/transformers-reactivate-leak-playable-characters-starscream-soundwave-2014669/">leaked screens of a 2018 development build</a> which include several possible playable characters, straddling the Autobot and Decepticon (bad guy Transformers) divide: Starscream, Slipstream, Hotrod, Soundwave, Sunstreaker, Ironhide and Windblade.</p><p>Alongside the game's announcement back in 2022, Splash Damage revealed the acquisition of Derby-based developers Bulkhead, creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battalion-1944">Battalion 1944</a> and The Turing Test. Bulkhead have been working on the Transformers game alongside Wardogs, a combined-arms FPS with strategy game elements. I interviewed members of Bulkhead many moons ago, and thought they were a good bunch. </p>
<p>Transformers aside, Splash Damage are currently known to be working on <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/announcing-project-astrid/">Project Astrid</a>, an open world survival shooter set in an original universe, with input from streamers Sacriel and shroud.</p>
<p>It's possible the layoffs have to do with wider restructuring at Splash Damage's overall parent company Tencent, who were recently <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-rebukes-layoff-and-restructuring-rumours-but-admits-changes-at-the-top-of-the-company">rumoured</a> to be making significant reductions across their organisation. Tencent announced <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">layoffs at Sumo Group in June last year</a> followed by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-confirms-layoffs-at-sharkmob-london">layoffs at Sharkmob London in November</a>.</p>
<p>A few game developers have reacted to the Transformers: Reactivate cancellation on social media. "I enjoyed my time working on this, my heart goes out to all the talented Devs at splash &amp; bulkhead working on this," <a href="https://x.com/IdreeceHadi/status/1877048039262634179">wrote</a> Idreece Hadi, Cloud Imperium level designer and former Bulkhead game designer. "I hope you all get something in this troubling time, hopefully soon the industry gets some positive news this is terrible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-15-to-11/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-15-to-11.1077777/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-15-to-11/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>On the cusp of the top ten, we have a selection of games that mix the known quantities – where we’ve had hands ons, are seeing sequels, and have firm release dates – and the less known projects, where the air of intrigue goes someway to ramping up our anticipation for what they might bring.</p>
<p>You know what you’re getting with the next game from Hazelight and Josef Fares, for example, and Split Fiction is coming out soon, but when the last we saw of Marvel 1943 was a cinematics heavy story trailer last summer, can we really trust that the game will hit in 2025? Well, that’s half the fun of these lists, isn’t it?</p>
<h2>15 – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 4th February 2025</em></p>


<p>It’s been a good seven years since the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and fans of this historical RPG have &nbsp;been waiting a long, long time for Henry and Sir Hans’ journey to continue. There’s less than a month to wait, you’ll be glad to hear, with our duo journeying through medieval Bohemia in the early 1400s to deliver a message at the start of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPS-pgg3scE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Things…. don’t quite go to plan, and they’re swept up in the problems of kings and wars that are increasingly affecting the region. This grand sequel will feature two main areas, with the Bohemian paradise of the opening juxtaposed with the city of Kuttenberg and all of the political intrigue that that can bring. Don’t worry if you don’t remember or haven’t played the original, as Warhorse promise this will be a good starting point, even if it’s a direct narrative continuation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">We got to go hands on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> last summer, experiencing the game’s opening and a snippet of the action once Henry reached the big city.</p>
<h2>14 – Mafia: The Old Country</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Summer 2025</em></p>
<p>The Mafia series is going back to where it all began, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> tracing its narrative steps back to the early 1900s and before the crime families of Sicily saw their influence spread through the emigration of Italians to the United States.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - The Initiation Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkdV6NxPOLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’ll be cast as Enzo Favara, having to prove their worth to the Cosa Nostra, fighting to survive through the brutal underworld of organised crime. Enzo’s already survived labor in the sulphur mines, and now has a chance (in a twisted way) to find a better life for himself by working for Don Torrisi’s crime family, doing whatever it takes to gain and retain favour along the way.</p>
<p>The game looks fantastic from the snippets of action that we’ve seen, and this is absolutely one to keep an eye on in 2025.</p>
<h2>13 – The Outer Worlds 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">chucked Xbox exclusivity out the airlock</a>, about as ceremoniously as you could yeet yourself into the nearest star in the original. The sequel promises to do all the usual sequelly things with more action, more weapons, more possibilities, and more better graphics.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<h2>12 – Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</h2>
<p><em>Platforms TBC – 2025</em></p>
<p>With a story penned by Amy Hennig (best known for her time at Naughty Dog with the PS3 Uncharted trilogy), and an intriguing time period, a lot of people are looking forward to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>. That said, it’s been quite a while since we last heard something about this title. Heck, we don’t even have a formal confirmation of platforms yet!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With switching perspectives between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones as they look to thwart Hydra’s plans at the heights of WW2, you can expect the gameplay and tone to switch as you jump between characters. We’ll hopefully see the game in action soon, if it’s still coming out later this year.</p>
<h2>11 – Split Fiction</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 6th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Coming from the makers of the excellent Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/22/a-way-out-review/">A Way Out</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> – and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/split-fiction-is-the-new-co-op-game-from-josef-fares-and-he-only-used-a-few-rude-words-to-announce-it/">an only lightly sweary introduction from Josef Fares</a> at The Game Awards – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> has shot right to the top of our must-watch list as another splitscreen co-op experience that you’ll want to hunker down with a partner or friend to play.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Split Fiction | Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcwngWPXQtg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Split Fiction sees Mio and Zoe – named after Fares two daughters – as two aspiring writers who are seemingly conned into feeding their stories into an evil AI machine. While AI stealing human beings content is worryingly close to reality, the game sees Mio and Zoe pulled into the machine, and their two stories, one fantasy and one sci-fi mixed and merged, with the duo jumping between the two from level to level. Each level will introduce new mechanics, blending fantasy and sci-fi tropes together in some intriguing ways. We can’t wait!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-over-%E2%80%93-we-know-who-launched-the-first-nukes-in-fallout.1077774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>(Originally covered October 2023)</strong></p>



<p>It’s one of the longest-standing points of debate in the history of the franchise. In Fallout, who launched the first nuke? There have been many theories that surfaced over the years, but owing to the nature of the war and how it all unfolded in the Fallout universe, a definitive answer was never provided to who shot first in Fallout.</p>



<p>Now, the co-creator of Fallout – Tim Cain – has made it clear during an interview who was responsible for kick-starting The Great War by firing off those first missiles.</p>



<p>So, who dropped the bombs first in Fallout? Let’s find out what Tim said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-and-the-first-nuke-launched-in-fallout-was-by">And The First Nuke Launched in Fallout Was By…</h2>



<p>Fallout’s lore is incredibly dense and probably more extensive than almost any game that exists today. There is a twenty-five-year history wrapped up in the franchise that spans several main releases, each of which has served to expand the game’s lore immeasurably. From factions to locations and key events to inventions, the backstory to Fallout is nothing short of monumental. </p>



<p>And now, one of the biggest mysteries of the Fallout universe has been settled.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17EqWDn7gyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview</a>, Tim Cain spoke about all things Fallout, and for a brief moment, he touched upon the very origins of The Great War. He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Fallout world, the FEV is the Forced Evolutionary Virus, a concoction that was once supposed to be a medical marvel but ultimately resulted in the creation of horrifically mutated creatures. </p>



<p>That’s the confirmation from the horse’s mouth – the creator himself. It was China that shot first in the Fallout universe because America was creating bio-weapons and refused to stop when asked even when geopolitical tensions were as rocky as they could have ever been.</p>



<p>Can we put that to bed now? Who dropped the first bombs in Fallout? It was <strong>China</strong>.</p>



<p>But should I mention that the Fallout TV show, which premiered in April 2024, seems to be headed down a contradictory path, suggesting that it was Vault-Tec that fired first? That’s yet to be confirmed, but it was <strong>heavily </strong>alluded to in the show’s first season.</p>



<p>What do you think?</p>

            <p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launches later this week and will bring significant balance changes.</p>
<p>The online hero shooter has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and despite a perceived dominance of certain characters, NetEase's analysis reveals "significant shifts in team compositions" and "a vibrant diversity of lineups".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">patch notes</a> continue: "However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield."</p>

<p>As such, Season 1 will bring various balance changes to ensure a "richer, more engaging, and diverse" experience, although there will be no extensive changes to Team-Up abilities - redesigns and adjustments will arrive in Season 2.</p>
<p>The new season brings nerfs to some particularly dominant characters: Hulk's Indestructible Guard shield value has been reduced; Hawkeye's medium-long range damage has been decreased; and Hela has had her base health reduced.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Black Widow has been buffed with increased range of her ultimate ability, Namor's egg-throwing will be more accurate, and Storm has received an overall increase to her damage capability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NetEase has released a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/">Hero Hot List</a> to show the most frequently chosen heroes across PC and console in both Quickplay and Competitive modes.</p>
<p>In Quickplay, Jeff the Land Shark tops both lists surprising nobody - he was even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-winter-celebration-features-splatoon-esque-arcade-mode-starring-jeff-the-land-shark">star of a Splatoon-style arcade mode over Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>In Competitive mode, Luna Snow is top for PC players while Cloak &amp; Dagger is top for console players. Black Widow and Storm are the least popular, hence the incoming buffs.</p>
<p>Season 1 will be released on Friday, 10th January.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-fantastic-four-arrive-in-marvel-rivals-this-week-as-part-of-vampiric-first-season">new season will bring the Fantastic Four as playable heroes</a>, although players are concerned the design of the Invisible Woman (Sue Storm) is too similar to Dagger, making them hard to tell apart in the heat of battle. Skins will likely be used to make them stand out.</p>

			<p>Shadow of the Colossus is a name we haven't heard in a long time. The PlayStation 2 action/adventure masterpiece originally developed by Team Ico was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-colossus-a-classic-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remade for the PlayStation 4 in 2018 by Bluepoint</a>, but beyond that, the PlayStation IP has lied dormant. Team Ico is no more; Lead Game Designer Fumito Ueda left after The Last Guardian to found genDESIGN, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased their new project</a> at The Game Awards 2024.</p>
<p>Not many of you may remember that a film adaptation was announced all the way back in April 2009 by Sony Pictures. In 2012, news broke that Josh Trank would direct the movie, but that changed in September 2014, when it was shared that 'Mom' director Andrés Muschietti would direct the film instead.</p>
<p>For over ten years, there's been no news at all, leading many to assume the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation was essentially dead. However, Muschietti has finally provided an update in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tugk5mzMHqM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Argentinian YouTube Channel Radio TU</a>.</p>
<p>The director, who has since released the acclaimed horror movies It/It Chapter Two and the way less successful The Flash, said he loves the franchise and is still working on the project. Muschetti also confirmed there's a script he likes and did not hide the reality that the budget still needs to be secured. He'd like to get a big budget to make the Shadow of the Colossus movie as immersive as possible, but a film production studio needs to be convinced first. Here's the full translated quote:</p>
<p><em>Well, Shadow of the Colossus is a game that I absolutely loved when it came out, and I played it several times. Plus, it's one of those things that I keep going back to. I'm not really a big gamer, especially since I started working, you know? The free time you have shrinks, so there have been only a few games that I've really gotten into since then.</em></p>
<p><em>I started making movies, but Shadow of the Colossus feels like a masterpiece. It's a project we've been developing for over 10 years. After 'Mom,' I kept busy too, you know? It wasn't a film that came out right away because of everything going on in Hollywood. Basically, you start developing a project, and for some reason, it gets delayed, or something pops up in the middle. It's like juggling plates to stay afloat in that industry; you have to keep a few spinning at once.</em></p>
<p><em>People don't really see it that way because they get hooked right away when they hear it. They think, "Oh, it's coming soon!" But actually, going public with a story like this has more to do with the whole vibe around the movie's release than with the actual chance of it getting made. So yeah, it's in development, and in the meantime, I did some stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a project that's been in the works for years, and now there's finally a chance to make it happen. It's still in development, but I really love this movie. There's a script I really like, and we'll see if it ends up being the next project. It's definitely not abandoned; it's still alive and kicking. Plus, you have to keep things in perspective, you know? The realism of a project really depends on how much money a studio can give me to make this movie. Unfortunately, there are factors that aren’t about your passion or desire to make it; it’s about how many people are going to watch this film and how popular a property like this is today. </em></p>
<p><em>Sure, Shadow of the Colossus is definitely a cult classic, but to make a good movie, there’s a studio that looks at the numbers and says... Well, how much interest is there in making a movie like this to give the director 200 million dollars or 150 or 100? There are different versions of this film. Personally, I want 200; I'll make it right! But that's just one of the factors to consider, and it's something that keeps fluctuating and being tested. It's still in development, and I'd love to work on it.</em></p>
<p>As we've been covering, gaming IPs are a prime target for both movie and TV adaptations. Sony itself, owner of the Shadow of the Colossus franchise, is leading the charge; earlier this week, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-to-adapt-horizon-and-helldivers-to-film-the-last-of-us-tv-season-2-launches-in-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two new films based on Horizon and Helldivers. However, those are hot intellectual properties that have just received new games; the world crafted by Team Ico, on the other hand, hasn't had a new installment since twenty years ago. As such, Sony might not be willing to bet big on it, which is why Muschietti is still having challenges with securing the budget for his vision.</p>
<p>We'll definitely keep an eye on any potential updates on the project, though. Stay tuned.</p>

        <p>Support effects depend on where allied characters in your party are positioned, allowing players to enjoy highly strategic maneuvers. Players have a high degree of freedom in character development, such as acquiring and strengthening skills and changing classes by using skill points earned in battle.</p><p>The characters are beautifully drawn with rich facial expressions by the illustrator Sakura Mochi!</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Several years have passed since a mysterious disease with no cure quickly spread across the continent.</p><p>Those infected would suffer a horrible fate of turning into zombies after their death, mindlessly attacking the living. It has become the norm for hired mercenaries to spend countless days clearing the lands of the undead.</p><p>Such a mercenary is Johann, captain of the Silver Wolf Mercenary Company. He is paid a visit by the Grim Reaper, and narrowly escapes its blade of death, but the Reaper leaves him with an eerie prophecy: “In the next 100 days, your luck shall run out. That shall be the day of your fate.”</p><p>After awaking from a delirious slumber, he is met by a young woman with miraculous powers that can heal people from the disease.</p><p>Was his encounter with the Grim Reaper but a nightmare….?</p><p>Regardless, Johann offers to protect the miracle worker on her travels to save as many people as she can. They set out on a journey to travel the kingdom, curing the infected.</p><p>Soon, however, Johann must confront his mortality…</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Advent Soul</strong> – When Amalie, the heroine is in your party, you can fill a gauge on the top right of the screen which will allow you to stock 1 BP when full. (Up to 9 BP can be stocked up.) By using BP characters can enter a state called “Advent Soul” which fortifies the character for a certain period of time. The character can then use “Advent attacks” with other party members and “Soul Exceed” skills, which are special moves.</li><li><strong>Advent Attacks</strong> – When a character in “Advent mode” is positioned to sandwich an enemy with another ally, a coordinated attack can be unleashed by performing a normal attack or attack skill. The Advent attacks are unique skills for each character and provide a chance to inflict heavy damage.</li><li><strong>Soul Exceed Skills</strong> – Units in Advent mode can use Soul Exceed skills at any time. This special move is unique to each character, and effects vary from inflicting immense damage to the enemy to recovering HP and abnormalities of all allies. (Once Soul Exceed is used, the character’s Advent mode will be lifted.) Utilizing Soul Exceed skills are the key to victory!</li><li><strong>Orbs with Hidden Power</strong> – There are mysterious “Orbs” that can be obtained from story progression, specific locations, and certain enemies. There are 13 Orbs in total scattered throughout the game. You can check the status of your collection on a dedicated screen and equip your character with them as accessories. What will happen when all the Orbs are collected?</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

19 children and two teachers were killed in the attack on Robb Elementary School in May 2022, while 17 others were injured. Families of those killed during the tragedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">later filed lawsuits in Texas and California</a> against Activision (after it emerged the shooter had played Call of Duty), alongside Instagram owner Meta and gun manufacturer Daniel Defense.
</p>
<p>
"This three-headed monster," the lawsuit alleged, "knowingly exposed [the perpetrator] to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it." At the time of last May's filing, Activision called the shooting "horrendous and heartbreaking", but noted "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".
</p>
<p>
Now though, as reported by journalist Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, Activision has formally submitted its initial defence, spanning nearly 150 pages of legal documentation filed last December. In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813228593/Activision-s-direct-legal-reply-to-the-Uvalde-families-lawsuit-via-Game-File">six-page direct response to the California lawsuit</a>, the publisher has denied "each and every allegation contained in the Complaint", claiming, among other things, a lack of causation between Call of Duty and the shooting. Totilo notes the publisher has also asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of California's anti-SLAPP laws, which are designed to prevent the abuse of the legal system against a defendant's free speech.
</p><p>
"Call of Duty tells complex stories that explore the real-world combat scenarios that soldiers face in modern warfare," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813227428/Activision-s-defense-in-Call-of-Duty-Uvalde-lawsuit-via-Game-File">separate 35-page filing</a>. "There can be no doubt Call of Duty is expressive and fully protected by the First Amendment... By bringing a laundry list of causes of action against Activision premised on allegedly dangerous 'hyper-realistic content' in the Call of Duty video games played by the perpetrator who committed heinous acts of violence, the Complaint runs headfirst into this overriding constitutional principle."
</p>
<p>
Activision's submissions also include a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813230017/Declaration-of-Matthew-Thomas-Payne-in-Mata-et-al-vs-Meta-Activision-Microsoft-via-Game-File">35-page declaration from Notre Dame media studies professor Matthew Thomas Payne</a>, arguing the Call of Duty series "flows from the same military realism tradition that has been explored for decades in critically acclaimed war movies and television shows" - and is thus far from the "training camp for mass shooters" in which "teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease" described in the Uvalde families' lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
The publisher's defence is also supported by a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813229303/Call-of-Duty-s-chief-Patrick-Kelly-s-declaration-for-Mata-vs-Activision-via-Game-File">38-page submission from Call of Duty head of creative Patrick Kelly</a>, which goes into significant detail regarding the design and creation of the series. This is the same document that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-cost-an-eye-popping-700m-to-make">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's eye-popping $700m budget</a>, and includes a wealth of information Activision's lawyers could potentially use to counter the various claims made in the Uvalde families' legal filing.
</p>
<p>
For instance, while the claimant's suit alleges the Uvalde shooter learned about the gun he used from the loading screen of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Kelly highlights two key points. Firstly, he says the generic assault rifle depicted in the image had been deliberately anonymised to ensure it did not feature identifiers that could link it to any particular firearm manufacturer. Secondly, he notes that by the time the perpetrator played the game in November 2021, the loading screen had been changed and would likely not have been seen.
</p><p>
There's plenty more detail in Activision's submitted documentation, and Totilo has a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/activision-uvalde-call-of-duty-defense">considerably expanded breakdown of the publisher's arguments</a> in his paywalled newsletter. The Uvalde families have until late February to respond to Activision's filings, and the publisher can then reply in April. As Totilo notes, if the case goes to trial, it likely won't be for a long time.

These two models have the same battery capacity and power delivery output, but the $11.58 model has two USB Type-C and one USB Type-A ports.

A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times while still managing a slim footprint. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. Both power banks also boast a 22.5W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W, which is the charging rate of the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. Both power banks also also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage, you are well in the clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more options?

Despite having launched only last month, NetEase says it’s happy with the “vibrant diversity of lineups” it has seen this far but still sees some room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hence, in the first half of Season 1, we are set to make balance adjustments to certain heroes, enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all,” the team explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the balance tweaks arriving in the first half of Marvel Rivals Season 1 include slight nerfs to a few of the more dominant heroes in the roster. Hulk’s Indestructible Guard gamma shield is going from 250 to 200 health, while Hela will be hit with a base health reduction that brings her from 275 to 250. Hawkeye is also getting a decrease to his medium-long range damage alongside a slight increase to his close combat resistance. Then there's Luna Snow, whose ultimate ability will now take longer to switch from damage to healing.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The list of heroes set to benefit from buffs, meanwhile, is quite long, with Cloak &amp; Dagger, Storm, Punisher, Moon Knight, and more due improvements in some form. Captain America is getting some of the more substantial balance adjustments, with NetEase aiming to enhance his survivability. Jeff’s Joyful Splash healing is also getting an increase from 140/s to 150/s, while the team has also moved to make his ultimate ability warning marker line up better with its actual radius.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1">Marvel Rivals Season 1</a> launches this Friday, January 10.

It’s a list that will almost certainly change with Season 1 not only because of the balance adjustments but the introduction of four new heroes with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image">Fantastic Four</a>.

          <p>Just when you thought you had seen every possible <em>Doom</em> mod, two game developers <a href="https://bobatealee.itch.io/doom-the-gallery-experience">released a free browser game</a> that reimagines the first level of 1993's <em>Doom</em> as an art gallery, replacing demons with paintings and shotguns with wine glasses.</p>
<p><em>Doom: The Gallery Experience</em>, created by Filippo Meozzi and Liam Stone, transforms the iconic E1M1 level into a virtual museum space where players guide a glasses-wearing Doomguy through halls of fine art as classical music plays in the background. The game links each displayed artwork to its corresponding page on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website.</p>
<p>"In this experience, you will be able to walk around and appreciate some fine art while sipping some wine and enjoying the complimentary hors d’oeuvres," write the developers on the game's itch.io page, "in the beautifully renovated and re-imagined E1M1 of id Software's <em>DOOM</em> (1993)."</p>

<p>In the game, players gather money scattered throughout the gallery to purchase items from the gift shop. It also includes a "cheese meter" that fills up as players consume hors d'oeuvres found in the environment, collected as if they were health packs in the original game.</p>

<p>2024 was nothing short of a disaster for Ubisoft. In fact, it’s safe to say that it’s had a rough few years. Ubisoft stock has fallen from its February 2021 high of €84.60 to a mere €12.53 at the time of writing. That’s a massive 85% reduction in stock price from its all-time high. To put things into perspective, if you invested $1000 into Ubisoft during its peak, you’d now only be left with $150.</p>



<p>So far, its current fiscal year hasn’t been great either and has seen poor financial results attributed to games missing internal expectations, increased development costs, game cancellations, and delays. The years of mismanagement, overspending, and generally just being out of touch with the gaming sphere have led Ubisoft to a crossroads. Unfortunately, it’ll ultimately be the developers that suffer the consequences, and with Ubisoft’s future seemingly hanging in the balance of just one AAA game, that being Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we might not have to wait long to see how things shake out.</p>



<h2 id="h-buy-out-talks">Buy Out Talks</h2>



<p>It’s been widely reported that Ubisoft is currently in talks with advisors about ways to stabilize the business, with the most recent reports suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-buyout-talks-continue-as-stock-trading-temporarily-halted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tencent was set to buy out the company and take it private</a>. Those talks seem to have stopped, as a significant term in negotiations revolved around the Guillemot brothers’ insistence on retaining control, which is likely a term that Tencent probably wouldn’t want to agree to. After all, the Guillemot brothers essentially put Ubisoft in this predicament in the first place.</p>



<p>For now, the negotiation halt seems to be a strategy both sides are playing. Tencent will continue to snap up shares and raise its stake. At the same time, the Guillemot brothers will want to wait until late February to early March to reignite negotiations, as Ubisoft is set to release the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14</a>. An Assassin’s Creed Shadows failure gives Tencent more opportunities to increase its stake at a lower share value. Conversely, a successful launch gives the Guillemot brothers more negotiating power to head into further talks.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It seems that, at least by my own sources, the move could favor the Guillemot brothers more. By all accounts from various Ubisoft sources, pre-orders for the game were high before the game’s delay and are still looking strong, but expectedly still behind that of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (which was released on both past and current generation consoles at the time). Assassin’s Creed Shadows seems to be Ubisoft’s last major lifeline, and even if the game is a tremendous success, it doesn’t necessarily mean Ubisoft is out of the woods.</p>



<h2 id="h-mismanagement-hell">Mismanagement Hell</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and mismanagement go hand-in-hand; you can’t have one without the other. Over the past few years, I’ve reported on countless projects that have faced mismanagement issues, and it seems that it’ll never change at face value. For the most part, it comes down to upper management’s personal friendships and family, with one looking out for another at the expense of thousands of frustrated developers.</p>



<p>The most public projects that have struggled are the likes of Ubisoft’s self-proclaimed AAAA title Skull &amp; Bones and Beyond Good and Evil 2, with the latter still not having a public release date despite being announced 16 years ago. But beyond the more prominent titles, the mismanagement at the company has led to countless projects being canceled or in a confusing stage of development without any end in sight. One notable game, codenamed Project U, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned to the drawing board after five years of development</a> and saw its budget balloon in size. One developer who worked on the project said they wouldn’t be surprised if it already exploded past the $100M mark.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>, one of the most promising free-to-play shooters at Ubisoft, and to be honest, in the entire industry over the past decade, released half-baked thanks to the same fate of mismanagement and higher-ups only looking out for themselves. After the game’s initially impressive numbers, developers told me that the writing was on the wall for months and that it would eventually close due to the massive drop-off and lack of player spending. &nbsp;The game was losing several million dollars in development costs alone — and that’s without the initial development costs, servers, and more on top — a cost that Ubisoft couldn’t afford in its current state, nor see a future where it could become a profitable title due to its own doing.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the end, Ubisoft’s mismanagement presents a serious challenge for the company moving forward. Despite Ubisoft’s board launching an investigation into the company’s struggles (of which 5 members are from the Guillemot family, by the way), no one, at least to those I’ve talked to, believes it will lead to any change. Speaking with past and current Ubisoft employees at various levels in the company, it’s widely speculated that CEO Yves Guillemot would rather go down with the [Skull &amp; Bones] ship rather than give up his position with a similar sentiment reflected about the other Guillemot brothers. It’s a hurdle the company will somehow need to overcome wherever Assassin’s Creed Shadows lands, even if it’s a success.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s latest annual internal survey, which allows employees to somewhat anonymously (I say this because departments and studios are not anonymous) give feedback to the company, shows that employee trust in the company is staggeringly low. While I do not have an exact number for the entire company, some studios had an overall company trust level as low as 15-20% (purposely being vague here).</p>



<h2 id="h-an-uncertain-future">An Uncertain Future</h2>



<p>It feels somewhat inevitable that at some point during 2025, Ubisoft will change in a big way. Going private seems the likely way forward, but that decision will undoubtedly affect thousands of developers.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ubisoft could try and simply ride out the storm, especially if Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the way they hope, but the company needs to streamline the number of projects it’s working on. It needs to earn players’ trust back, starting with Shadows; and it needs to continue building that trust again, first, by stopping the constant chasing of trends.</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently has some big hitters in development and set to release by the end of 2026, including Splinter Cell Remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Hexe</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost Recon Over</a>, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and a few other smaller projects under big IP names. The Division 3, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rayman Remake</a>, another Assassin’s Creed Remake codenamed Stardust, another flagship Assassin’s Creed RPG, and Beyond Good and Evil 2 (which is now progressing well) are further out.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Yet, on the flip side, Ubisoft continues pumping money into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-project-u-gameplay-details-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U</a>, Project Scout (another Battle Royale heavily inspired by Apex Legends), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Maverick</a> (a Far Cry extraction-based shooter), NFT games, and several more titles that almost everyone with common sense will say is not going to provide a return on investment. To be clear, I’m not saying that Ubisoft needs to stop trying “new” ideas (the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing-inspired ALTERRA in development at Ubisoft</a> looks phenomenal in my opinion), but some projects are so blatantly destined to fail, that it’s mind-boggling that the company continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that they don’t have, on projects in the hopes that they are the next Fortnite.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is undoubtedly at a crossroads. However it goes, change has to happen at the top for it to succeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The Golden Needle, how I loathe you. Credit: LocalThunk</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Balatro</em> and I had come to an agreement. I was only allowed to interact with it under certain conditions. I was almost free of its grasp again when I hit the cruelest scenario of all: Golden Needle.&nbsp; I was trapped in a prison of my own creation until I found a way to win.</p><p>Some context: I had previously banished <em>Balatro</em> from my personal computer. If it’s on there, like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> work just doesn’t get done</a>. I knew instinctively that the mobile version was going to be far more insidious, and largely resisted its call until I had a six-hour Thanksgiving train ride to my parents I needed to kill. So I allowed it back into my system under the condition that I delete it immediately from my phone after the holiday was over.&nbsp;</p><p>This arrangement largely worked until I tried to reinstall the game for a Christmas train ride and found out that cloud saves were nonfunctional for a huge portion of users on iOS. This is a huge issue and you will see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fq287j/careful_with_cloud_save/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tons of pissed off reddit threads on the topic</a>. All that progress I had previously was gone. Lucky, the developers were smart enough to include an option in the menu that lets you just unlock everything. The problem with that is that I am goal oriented when playing <em>Balatro</em>, and with nothing to unlock I decided to go after the 20 “challenges,” custom scenarios built into a special mode in the game.</p><p>Most of the challenges in <em>Balatro</em> are fun and fairly straightforward. The Rich Get Richer starts you off with $100 and vouchers that max out your interest, but limits your scorable chips to the amount of money you have. Medusa gives you a single, indestructible <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Marble_Joker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marble Joker</a>, which rapidly fills your deck with stone cards. Fragile gives you a deck of entirely glass cards and gives you <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Oops!_All_6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two jokers that double all probabilities</a>, which makes glass cards break every time. Each of these scenarios forces the player to work around the limitations of their deck and often upend how the game is played.&nbsp;</p><p>Challenges are fair for the most part until you get to the last three and the difficulty skyrockets tremendously. Cruelty forces you to operate at a disadvantage – small blinds and big blinds give no reward money. This sucks but is very reliably beatable. Jokerless forces the player to operate without jokers. This also sucks, but there are ways to get to the end without jokers – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bx1jhf/comment/kyae510/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building on four of a kind or straights, which scale more aggressively</a>. Of the three, Golden Needle is the cruelest.</p><p>Golden Needle<em> </em>starts you off with a <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Credit_Card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Card</a> joker and $10, allowing you to go -$20 in debt. Each used discard costs you $1. You have six discards a round, and can only play one hand each round. Welcome to hell.</p><figure><figcaption>These Jokers all become far more powerful in Golden Needle. Credit: Localthunk </figcaption></figure><p>What makes Golden Needle<em> </em>so frustrating is that it is the scenario most dependent on random chance. You get past the first round by aggressively cycling through one of the few hands that can beat it – usually a high end straight, flush or full house. What you pull in the first shop determines how you must proceed, if you can at all.</p><p>Golden Needle also subtly changes the way you play the game. Certain MVP jokers that would carry you through the game, jokers that get stronger each hand like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ride_the_Bus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ride The Bus</a> or <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Spare_Trousers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spare Trousers</a>, do not scale fast enough to account for the scenario. Conversely, other jokers that shine in a scenario with one hand and six discards become elevated in importance – jokers like <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat </a>(which gives you a 3x multiplier on the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dusk</a> (retriggers the final hand), <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Cream</a> (which gives you a massive chip bump but reduces every hand played) and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Castle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castle </a>(gains +3 chips every time a specific suit is discarded).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Oh COME ON. Credit: Localthunk.</figcaption></figure><p>The constant financial drain of discarding means maintaining a functioning economy becomes twice as hard, and you are forced to take a risk to pull yourself out of debt, or function exclusively in the negative. On top of this, certain <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Blinds_and_Antes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss blinds</a> like The Mouth or The Needle become irrelevant, while others like The Water will destroy you outright. This unique combination of pure chance and elevated strategy mean that you not only have to be lucky, you also have to be good. Every round played is on a knife’s edge. One move and you are done.</p><figure><figcaption>Here's what worked. Flushes. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>That’s where I was for days: refusing to delete <em>Balatro</em> until I bested Golden Needle. Through a series of convoluted circumstances I engineered a prison of gaming that I could technically leave but refused to out of pride. I have gotten to the final round multiple times, only to come up short by inches. And this morning, as I was writing this, it finally happened. A combination of the <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Banner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banner</a>, <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acrobat</a> and <a href="https://balatrogame.fandom.com/wiki/Onyx_Agate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onyx Agate</a> while focusing on juicing flushes (which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1bbh75a/how_to_win_chips_and_influence_mult_a_thorough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normally a bad idea</a> but far more viable due to the number of discards in this specific scenario) carried me through to Ante 8. The joy I felt was sublime.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I'm finally free. Credit: LocalThunk</figcaption></figure><p>I love and hate you, Golden Needle,<em> </em>and now I have defeated you. Time to delete <em>Balatro</em> until my next train ride.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post"><h3>The Myth Of The Star Reporter</h3></a><p>Good journalism isn't created in a vacuum</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339206/agdq-2025-batman-forever-the-arcade-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>, the annual charity speedrunning marathon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24334425/how-to-watch-awesome-games-done-quick-agdq-2025">is in full swing</a>, already amassing over $500,000 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. With three more days to go, there’s a great many runs of popular games coming up. But relying on the schedule or your own preferences to determine when to tune in is a surefire way to miss the best AGDQ has to offer.</p><p>Take today, for example. I’ve never played <em>Batman Forever: The Arcade Game</em>, but after watching the speedrun, I might have to. It’s a Batman-flavored beat-’em-up that bears precious little resemblance to the movie it’s based on. The runner, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lrock617">LRock617</a>, chose to play as Robin and within moments of starting the game, I was hooked. The graphics were reminiscent of the early <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, appropriate since it was published by Acclaim Entertainment. But there was a surreality to them that — when combined with Robin’s overpowered abilities (like one that has him essentially go Super Saiyan), the runner’s charisma in explaining what’s happening, and the audience getting in on the fun with funny donation messages — gave the run an absurd goofiness that was a sorely needed shot in the arm at 9AM on a Wednesday morning. And if I hadn’t had the marathon on in the background, I would have missed it.</p><p>Games Done Quick’s schedule is set up to have the most popular games or gimmicky runs take place during the early evenings and weekends — the time when folks are most likely to tune in. But I’ve found some of my favorite runs are of games I’ve never heard of played well outside those primetime hours. I’ve developed a deep an abiding love of <em>Mr. Bones</em>, a Sega Saturn game I have never played, because I found it during <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-a-very-shitty-day-the-mr-bones-speedrun-helped-1846020990">a bout of January 6th-induced insomnia</a>. The <a href="https://youtu.be/NgQ6AKLsOwY?si=3QgLKu_rA81EL4l9"><em>Ratatouille</em> run from Summer Games Done Quick 2023</a>, one of that year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/summer-games-done-quick-2023-is-over-so-come-watch-ratatouille-cosplay">stand</a>-<a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/best-speedruns-sgdq-2023">out</a> runs, happened on a Tuesday at 11AM. </p><p>More than simply being entertained, keeping GDQ on all the time is a good way to find your next indie game. I didn’t know what<em> </em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fpizza-possum-switch%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorvTrs9fk-4p2sjbGWy50hNKRxjjWIIs2vgyJgyxUJLJLNp-6oE"><em>Pizza Possum</em></a> was, but after <a href="https://youtu.be/HPjJbwzn9k8?si=OooLH-EdTHGfzuG0">watching the speedrun</a>, it’s on my list of co-op games to try at home. There’s still plenty of AGDQ left to enjoy. There’s a <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> run that’ll be played while the runner plays the piano and I cannot wait for the <em>Crazy Taxi</em> run that’ll be accompanied by a live band playing covers of the songs in the game. But I’m even more excited to find the next hidden gem of the marathon purely by chance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Compared to a Steam Deck OLED, the Switch 2 mockup still feels noticeably smaller, in part because the Joy-Cons are not as pronounced and ergonomic as the Deck’s grips. But the mockup still feels closer in size to Valve’s handheld than the original Switch.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><p><figcaption><em>A rough size comparison with a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As previous rumors have indicated, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons will attach to the console via magnets instead of a sliding rail, Genki cofounder and CEO Eddie Tsai tells <em>The Verge</em>. To detach a Joy-Con from the Switch 2, you press a big button at the top of the backside of each controller, Tsai says, and that button apparently pushes out a pin that nudges against the chassis of the console, disconnecting the magnets.</p><p>You can remove the Joy-Cons with brute force if you really wanted to, according to Tsai, but he says, overall, they feel secure for regular use and that the big release button detaches the Joy-Cons with ease. Tsai declined to share where he’d learned details of the new console.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</p><p><figcaption><em>The left JoyCon without pressing the detachment button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Tsai also tells <em>The Verge</em> that housed within the mounting channel of the Joy-Cons is an optical sensor, and by using another attachment the new Joy-Cons may offer mouse-like functionality. It sounds a bit like what Lenovo does <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">with its Legion Go handheld</a>.</p><p>Nintendo has promised that it will announce the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>, and as that deadline creeps closer, there have been waves of leaks and rumors about the new hardware. In December, YouTube channel SwitchUp posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video</a> showing a 3D-printed, non-functional Switch 2 mockup provided by a Chinese case manufacturer. That mockup basically looked like the current Switch but bigger, and it revealed a few other potential changes like a new USB-C port on the top of the device and a mysterious new square button under the Home button on the right Joy-Con.</p><p>Days later, accessories-maker Dbrand announced its “Killswitch 2” case, and CEO Adam Ijaz <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that it was designed based on “actual dimensions”&nbsp;based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” Ijaz also said that it was his “understanding” that the console’s Joy-Cons are magnetically attached. And Dbrand’s imagery showed that the new square button had a “C” printed on it, though Ijaz didn’t know what it was. Days after that, our colleague Sean Hollister spoke with a Redditor who shared apparent photos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">of the Switch 2’s dock</a> and the&nbsp;inside&nbsp;of what appears to be a Switch 2 Joy-Con.</p><p>With that April 2025 deadline inching closer every day, it seems like it won’t be long until Nintendo officially, finally reveals the Switch 2. But until that happens, at least we have these pictures to look at.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
