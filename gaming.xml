Pioneering the action RPG space with the <strong>Ys</strong> series, it's recently become more well-known for its continent-spanning epic turn-based series, <strong>Trails</strong>.</p>
<p>On <strong>15th January 2026</strong>, the series' 13th entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, will be launching on Switch and Switch 2 in the West. And, as a huge fan of the franchise, it's probably the most excited I've been for a new game from Falcom in some time. Daybreak's more-thoughtful and modern threads have really connected with me, and Van has become one of my favourite RPG protagonists in recent memory.</p>
<p>But, with Beyond the Horizon, we have another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_of_cold_steel_iv">Cold Steel IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_into_reverie">Trails into Reverie</a> situation on our hands — a huge gathering of characters across the franchise all impacted by one big event. It really feels like the culmination of this gigantic series, and with the end steadily approaching, I was eager to reflect and look back with Falcom President and series producer Toshihiro Kondo.</p>
<p>What starts off as a chat about the newest game turned into a peek behind 20 years of history, from technological advancements (both narratively and in the world), the influence of real-world politics, and the potential of the Switch 2 for the series going forward. It's a long one, so grab a cup of coffee and settle in!</p>
<p><em>Note: There are a few spoilers about Trails into Reverie here, so if you haven't played that game or don't know the identity of a certain character yet, you might want to wait before diving in!</em></p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Alana Hagues): Let's start with something very simple - can you set the scene for Trails Beyond the Horizon? How does it tie in with Van’s story and what can fans expect on a general level?</strong></p>
<div><p><strong>Toshihiro Kondo</strong><strong>, President of Falcom:</strong> For Trails Beyond the Horizon, it's essentially a sequel to Trails through Daybreak II, and takes place directly after it. While Daybreak 1 and 2 dealt with issues that were occurring within the Republic of Calvard, this time the scope broadens to not only include what’s happening in Calvard, but also to the continent itself. So the series finally opens up into these mysteries that have been at the core of what the continent is and what this world is overall.</p><p>

One of our main characters is Van still. Van will continue his work as a Spriggan, handling the things that he's done. And what he's acting upon is due to a lot of the events and connections that he made throughout the course of Daybreak 1 and 2. Whether that be connections in the government or connections in the Ouroboros Society, all of these people Van met are now going to come into play here as he looks to see what's going on with this event that's going to be happening in the course of this game in Calvard.</p></div>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2b89a072e3a6/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This event is a space program, which has been built up as a national project, and pretty much all of the events of this game have to do with what's going on with this space project. Without spoiling anything, we've been adding some teasers in there, that's kind of what's going on with this game.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big focuses for the series is the technological advancements across the games —</strong> <strong>now seems like a good time to ask, why space travel now? What do you think the importance is in the canon at this point? It's such a big leap from where we were 20 years ago to now.</strong></p>
<p>That’s a great question! And the answer to that is precisely what Trails Beyond the Horizon is all about. Why has technology advanced so much?</p>
<p>As you mentioned, we're 20 years out from the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky">Trails in the Sky</a> (in Japan, at least), but if you look at the actual in-game timeline from Sky and what's happening now in Calvard, that's less than 10 years. It's a very short span of time. And so that's a really good observation — how did we go from airships to space?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. We've been planning this all along (laughs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another one of the big mysteries of this world is Orbment and the powers that Orbment bestows upon the inhabitants of the world and how the world operates itself. These are also things that you can expect to see touched upon and explored, and begun to be unraveled in Trails Beyond the Horizon. If you look even at Trails in the Sky into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_from_zero">Trails from Zero</a>, you'll notice that technology gets a pretty big bump from those two games. For one thing, you've got what amounts to the internet in Crossbell, as well as what we could consider smartphones.</p>
<p>I’m sure a lot of the fans were probably thinking when these games originally were released, ‘oh, well, you're just hopping on current trends. This is what's happening in modern society, so this is what you're using as topics within the game to colour your world.’ No. We've been planning this all along (laughs). There's a lot here that we've been thinking about.</p>
<p>It's been many years since those games originally came out, now we can finally show the fans this has been part of the plan all along, and all of this is a very detailed plan for why technology has progressed as fast as it has</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Now I'm scared. (laughs)</strong> <strong>So</strong>, <strong>you touched on something in that t</strong><strong>his is the first game that's really “global” – you’ve got Van from Calvard, Rean from Erebonia, and Kevin from the Septian Church</strong>, <strong>all characters from across Zemuria. Why is the story of the continent now important?</strong></p>
<p>This answer is more from a game development perspective than from the more story-based thrust of your question…</p>
<p><strong>That’s totally fair! (laughs)</strong></p>
<p>In terms of Kevin specifically, he's part of the church, and his going to Calvard and doing what he does in this game has been flagged ever since his first appearance, and particularly in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky_the_3rd">Sky The 3rd</a>. There's a lot going on with [the church] and their relationship to the world itself. And so it makes sense that you would have someone there for that.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6be8454dbb032/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of Rean, if you look at the end of his story from Cold Steel IV, and then look at one of the ending events in Trails into Reverie, his story also touches upon the heart of what's going on in this world. Given that Rean's been confronted with various issues, he's not the type of person to just ignore things and stay home in Erebonia. He's going to get involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They need to be able to have these different experiences and meet these different people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the story were to take place solely through Van's eyes and minutely carry out all of these things that the story is trying to tell, it would be a ridiculously long game. It would end up killing the realism because he'd have to go to so many different places and meet so many different people and meet so many different things.</p>
<p>Choosing the direction we did to be able to tell this story covers a lot of the complexities of the nation of Calvard but also the overarching world as well, it necessitated us to have different routes so we could show all of these things concurrently. And all the more so, it wouldn't make sense for all the three of the characters to be similar to Van or to be in a situation to do what Van does. They need to be able to have these different experiences and meet these different people and these reasons for doing and going on the routes that they go on.</p>
<p>That's why the system was chosen of having multiple main characters, to be able to cover as cleanly as possible all of the events in the story that need to be covered and to also offer fresh perspective on the events that are taking place as being seen through the eyes of each different main character as we go through their roots.</p>
<p><strong>Right, and with Kevin in particular,</strong> <strong>this is the first time he's been playable</strong> <strong>since Trails in the Sky the 3rd as you brought up — there are a lot of people who won't even know who he is, which I feel really bad about because he's my favourite character (laughs).</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, what is it like revisiting a character like that after so long and</strong> <strong>putting him in the spotlight in this way?</strong></p>
<p>Good question (laughs) A hint for your answer lies in something that you pointed out, which is that Kevin is a member of the Septian Church. You can't expect someone who is jumping into Beyond the Horizon (as their first game) to fully grasp this organisation and the world it exists in. But if you are someone who has been playing the series at least for a few entries, you have an understanding of what the Septian Church is, at least on a superficial level. By having at least a superficial level of knowledge, that automatically places Kevin at a certain position in the players mind and their expectations.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac4de25fc0fb7/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing about Kevin is that at first glance he seems like a happy-go-lucky priest out there to do good and change the world for the better, but he has this very dark side to him too. These are things which we as developers paid careful attention to to kind of introduce or reintroduce to people throughout the course of the game.</p>
<p>For example, the group that Kevin works with in his story path is with Rufus from Cold Steel (and Reverie). And even though Kevin is a very senior member of the church who has authority and dignity and all these other things, he kind of gets given the runaround a lot by the people that he's dealt with. It's a really interesting balance between this dignity that he should have as a high member of a priest and what these characters are saying to him or making him do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are things that we're paying attention to when reviving this character</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, a lot of the interactions are written in a way, whether it be with Kevin and these characters or Kevin with other characters, that shows characters who this man is. Even though he has this very happy light side to him, there's also times when certain scenes necessitate him to have more of that darkness that we know that he has, that really serious side that occasionally has to get into given his role. These are things that we're paying attention to when reviving this character after he's not really been present in the series for so long (since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_to_azure">Azure</a>).</p>
<p>So, to kind of re-encapsulate that into something simple is first,to have players understand who the character is because of his role within the organisation that has already been introduced. And then second, to show through the interactions that he has with the other characters that he deals with in the game, these two sides of him as a character.</p>
<p><strong>There are so many characters at this point — how do you keep track of all of those personality changes and</strong> <strong>balance all of that together?</strong> <strong>Some we haven't seen for a long time, others are very new so we're still getting used to them. What's it like threading all of that together?</strong></p>
<p>It kind of comes down to the characters we want to show and the characters we want to introduce players to. How that works from a process standpoint is you create a character, particularly a main character, and then you think about that character in contrast to who they're paired with in their story.</p>
<p>To use Rean as an example; you've got a young man of few words, he's got this dark past about him, but he's also very serious. And he very much wants to get this job done, whatever that might be. And so around him, what kind of characters would you expect to see? How can they play off him? Are they different from him? How can they show these aspects of him that we've discussed? When creating these characters, it’s about how they can play off one another and how they're different from one another, that they get formed and created.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5755e4f8586d4/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, you have a larger role of who these characters are in this world. So, taking the three countries that we're most familiar with being, Erebonia (Cold Steel), the Kingdom of Liberl (Sky), and then the Republic of Calvard (Daybreak), what kinds of people would exist within these countries. In Liberl, you've got this very kind queen who's like a motherly figure to her people. How would the people in this country act? You've got Erebonia, which is a very strict class system with nobility and commoners. What kind of people would this give rise to?</p>
<p>Looking at what we have here now in the Republic of Calvard, it's a country made up of immigrants, of people from many different places. and that's how you're able to get characters like Feri or Aaron who are not Calvardian necessarily in terms of their race or ethnicity, but they are in this place. They contribute to this story and then being characterized against someone like Van, who is from Calvard, but he does the dirty work, right? He's got these sides to him which are very different than those around him and what came before. All of these things together are what creates the characters and how maybe not necessarily they keep track of them, but that's how they end up where they end up in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the series as a whole, one of the goals and ideas was to portray these very human problems and societal experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, you do bring up a good point when you say there are a lot of characters (laughs). This is something we’ve talked about internally on how to keep it manageable and reasonable and how to tell the stories that we want to tell without having these gigantic ballooning casts. We will continue to think about these things going forward when it comes to cast selection and who appears in games.</p>
<p><strong>To bounce off your point about Calvard, Trails feels extremely progressive and it feels like it's very much rolling with</strong> <strong>modern times and how society and politics and events are taking place in the real world. Do political or any kind of real events ever influence the story at all?</strong></p>
<p>For the series as a whole, one of the goals and ideas was to portray these very human problems and societal experiences. The thing is because many of the settings of the games veered more towards fantasy or something that felt divorced from reality, it probably didn't hit as hard as you would expect.</p>
<p>Now, looking at Calvard, that allowed us to do something different because the setting is so close to what is happening or modern day, We knew from the beginning because it's introduced in Sky that Calvard is a country that has lots of immigrants, a melting pot and made up of all these different people. However, that's where we left it in our minds (laughs) and we didn't really think about the details of Calvard at that point in time.</p>
<p>What really caused us to think about what Calvard was and who it's comprised of and the issues that it has is when we started making Erebonia. Calvard stands in direct contrast to each other when it comes to the societies that Erebonia have and the worlds Erebonians inhabit. So a lot of the guiding principles that caused Erebonia to be developed with its ideas and goals and issues, all that is reflected in Calvard. And that just kind of necessarily made it more of a realistic thing.</p>
<p>To more directly answer your question, absolutely real life events are referenced throughout. I thought it would be interesting to cover these types of topics, because many the staff who created this series 20 years ago are still here, particularly the core writing team. Over the course of 20 years as we've gotten older, and as we've begun to look at the world differently, and we have different outlooks on things and different things to say about what's happening in our world. And that gets reflected within the work itself on purpose.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d8965f4f13276/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, particularly in regards to immigration and racism, as a country Japan is not really known for having a bunch of people who are not Japanese inhabiting it. However, due to some recent initiatives by the Japanese government, the country is becoming more open and welcoming to people who are not originally Japanese. And because more and more people are coming into Japan, that creates a new society for Japanese people as well, and new issues that we've never encountered before.</p>
<p>We thought this would be an interesting thing to also explore in the Calvard games, something that we as Japanese people ourselves might be facing in the not too distant future. So yeah, all of these things that you touched upon, the real world does absolutely impact the writing, and we do want to make specific commentary or at least explore what's happening in the world through the events of the game and the societies and the people and the things that are depicted there.</p>
<p><strong>So I guess going along with the core team evolving along with the games, how has it been continuing to watch the world that everyone wrote down and dreamt up and all these characters grow up over 20 years?</strong> <strong>How do you continue a 20-year process like that?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a good question – I wonder how we do continue! (laughs)</p>
<p>So the interesting thing about the genesis of this whole world to begin with is one of practicality. At the time, if you look at the previous <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> games (<strong>Dragon Slayer</strong>, the <strong>Gagharv</strong> trilogy) that were pixel art. All of them depict a world; there was one whole world per game.</p>

<p>When game development and graphic design shifted to 3D, that greatly limited what we could do asset-wise. We were no longer able to create an entire world for one specific game. So the idea became between me and my co-worker, <em>"what if we can't depict the whole world maybe we can depict a country instead"</em>. So why don't we have a story about a country and then why don't we find out how this country connects to another country that would be in the same world but wouldn't be depicted in one single game.</p>
<p>As I started planning this some of the older people in the company were like, <em>"you guys are getting way ahead of yourselves here"</em> (laughs) <em>"</em><em>Why don't you try making one game first before you develop all these grand plans for things".</em> So this became a challenge to see what you could with what you essentially call limited resources to be able to work within this framework of telling the story of not a world now but a country, continuing that story in the next game in a different country within the world</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally, this was only meant to be three parts, and by parts I mean games:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That has what's become our motivation these last 20 years, to finish what we started. All of these games do take place in one world and they're all connected to one another by virtue of this fact and by virtue of the fact there being an overarching story that does connect everything. That's the real motivation now. That's what keeps us going. And that's how you keep a series going, is just this desire to finish what you started.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever think you would make it this far?</strong></p>
<p>No, I’m surprised too! (laughs) Originally, this was only meant to be three parts, and by parts I mean games: Liberl, then Erebonia, and then Calvard. That was it.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of creating Trails in the Sky [after three years], the president came up to us and said, <em>“okay, you guys have been working on this game for quite a while now. How close to completion are you here?”</em> And we said, <em>“we're about halfway through.”</em> He responded, <em>“great, release what you have, I don't care.”</em> So that's why Sky is divided into two parts.</p>
<p>The plan had started to fall apart because what was supposed to be one game is now two games. So what we had to do afterwards is create a game in a quicker span of time for the company to get it out there, which is obviously what became Sky the 3rd.</p>
<p>Logically, our next move would have been to make Erebonia. But I thought, <em>“well, no, we can't really go into this big area of Erebonia first. We need to think of something else first to lead into this a little bit better."</em> So that’s where Crossbell (Zero/Azure) came from.</p>
<p>But the thing about Crossbell is that it was only supposed to be one game as this bridge, which of course ended up being two games. Then we reach Erebonia and we start working on it. Only supposed to be two games. We figured at this point, it was gonna take at least two games to finish this part of the story. Yet that eventually turned into four games. And now here we are in Calvard and the story continues.</p>
<p>But no, never in my wildest dreams would I have expected this to be continuing and I never expected for things to turn out as they have in terms of how each location which was originally supposed to be one game is now multiple game-spanning arcs.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, I'll ask a sillier question in terms of evolution next.</strong> <strong>When you see character designs over the years, do you ever look at the new one and go “oh wow, I wish they’d looked this cool earlier!”?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! There’s definitely things that you look at and think “oh, this is really cool now”, but the truth is that whenever a game is released, we believe we’re releasing the best we can do at that time period. What you can see throughout the course of the history, not specifically for Trails but for all of our titles, is you can hopefully see us having improved and gotten better both in terms of art and then graphics as well. So things that were not able to have been done in the past have been able to do now</p>
<p>Within this also, you've got just visual trends, you know, what was cool 20 years ago is not necessarily cool or on trend for today. Sure there are things that you maybe think are cooler now compared to what you did before, but that doesn't change the idea that what's being released at the time is the best for that given time.</p>
<p>There's also some things as cool as a change might be, there's some lines that you can't cross, specifically when it comes to certain aspects of character design or what he would call like a silhouette. The character needs to have a specific look. Again, using Rean as an example, kind of a slim man who always has his katana at his side. You know who this character is. These are things which are visual clues and signs for the players to know who this character is.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3bbca1649e10a/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this together is just, it's essentially just evolution. I'm pretty proud of what we're releasing, whether it be in terms of character design itself or graphics as well.</p>
<p><strong>So another thing that has</strong> <strong>evolved is the combat. T</strong><strong>urn-based has always been like the core of Trails, and there's been a lot of discussion recently about turn-based combat and RPGs. Are you always conscious to keep turn-based combat in the series, and how have you looked to progress that, even outside of the real-time additions?</strong></p>
<p>The reason you have the turn-based combat battle system goes back to the very beginning, before the games even released in the West. This is a story-first series and these are story-first games. The general trend, at least in Japan at the time, was for story-based games to be turn-based. What that does is that essentially allows the players to take the game at their own pace and not have to feel pressure because of all this frantic action that they constantly have to worry about. Players can slowly go from place to place, enjoying the game and enjoying the world that's been created.</p>
<p>It also has to do with the DNA of the series itself, because the series itself does have a group of turn-based predecessors to it for the most part.</p>
<p>Also within Falcom's catalogue, you have the <strong>Ys</strong> series, which is in direct contrast as an action series. There's plenty of fans of the Ys series and plenty of fans of the Trails series, but people played what they wanted to play in terms of, "I like action," okay, you play Ys. "I like story focused," well, then you should play Trails. There was a little bit of overlap, but by and large, those groups were pretty separate from one another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we wondered how we could incorporate elements that made things move a little quicker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, over the course of developing the Trails series, we didn’t want things to become stale and as people became more used to the games, we wondered how we could incorporate elements that made things move a little quicker.</p>
<p>One of the issues that you encounter when it comes to command-based systems is that some think it's slow. You'll notice improvements come incrementally. In the two Crossbell games, you've got a little bit of field actions, where you can hit the enemy and then you'll start the battle. That kind of makes it a little bit more engaging, a little bit more active.</p>
<p>Moving into the Cold Steel series, that actually gets quite a bit more advanced in terms of positioning behind the enemies and what you can do on the field outside of the combat itself, but leading into the combat. So it finally culminates in Trails Through Daybreak, which is of course a hybrid battle system containing both the action RPG and the turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>However, we were really careful because of this trend of players who still preferred the more methodical approach of turn-based combat. We wanted to make the action combat simple and unobtrusive so far as if someone didn't want to engage it, that they didn't have to. So you'll note that the combat system outside of the turn-based combat system is pretty simple for Daybreak 1. And even though there are some additions in Daybreak 2, it's kind of a refinement; just a little bit is added, and the player can still choose to engage with it if they want.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the forthcoming Trails Beyond the Horizon; feeling that probably people have at least played Daybreak 1 and 2, we thought we could add a little bit more and so we've made the action system even more robust. There's a system called Awakening — it makes the combat feel even more quick, even more responsive. You can now cast arts on the field like you could in Daybreak, but it's also been refined so it makes this whole action system a really big part of what the game is and slowly acclimates people who might not be so familiar with it.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails Beyond the Horizon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbb3747a2b284/trails-beyond-the-horizon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: NIS America</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>By the same token, the turn-based element is always going to be there being part of the DNA, but that doesn't mean that because we wanted to have a more exciting action element that the turn-based side has been neglected. Rather, you'll see that the turn-based system has been iterated upon too, particularly in the forthcoming Horizon, there's many buffs that you can do, things that are unique and new that also further make the turn-based combat engaging and interesting as well. So it really is this nice balance of both of them.</p>
<p><strong>Trails Beyond the Horizon will be the first Trails game on the Nintendo Switch 2; at what point did you decide to release a Switch 2-specific version, and why was it important to release it on the new console?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NIS America:</strong> We felt it was important to release the title on Nintendo Switch 2 as many fans have been following our releases on Nintendo Switch, and we believe that those who have bought a Nintendo Switch 2 will be eager to play this title on it.</p>
<p><strong>What new opportunities</strong> <strong>does the Switch 2 bring for the Trails series?</strong></p>
<p>Kondo: The biggest thing obviously is the specs; such a big element of [Horizon] is the action, the specs being as they were [on Switch 1] it was very difficult to, you know, provide a positive or really good experience with that. Working with NIS America to be able to create a Switch 2 version, you know, that gets ameliorated and that makes it better now for the players</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, what this means for us going forward is that, yes, we do want to make sure that the games are on the Switch 2. And now, because we're more understanding of the specs and the capabilities that it has, we don't have to worry about that necessarily during development. And we can put it through its paces, as it were, to be able to release the types of games that we want that contain the elements that we want it to contain. You can expect to see the Trails series on the Switch 2 going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the decision to release the game as a Game-Key Card on the Switch 2 and not a full physical release?</strong></p>
<p>NIS America: We decided to release this title as a Game-Key Card on the Nintendo Switch 2 as we believed it was the most beneficial option for our customers.</p>

<p><em>I want to thank Mr. Kondo-san for taking the time to speak to us and for NIS America's Alan Costa for translating.<br></em></p>

There’s not much in the way of gameplay in the trailer, but it looks like <em>Battlefield 6</em> will focus heavily on spectacle and set-pieces. A reveal of the game’s multiplayer is coming on July 31st where we’ll presumably be able to see more of it in action.</p><p>Here’s the official description from EA:</p><div><blockquote><p>The trailer offers a first look at Pax Armata, a Private Military Corporation bankrolled by former NATO states whose agenda threatens to throw the world into global conflict. This sets the scene for what players can expect on the battlefield — both in multiplayer and the return of the series’ single player campaign.</p><p>In <em>Battlefield 6</em>, the series’ incredible blend of visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom returns. Blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage or take to the skies in white-knuckle dogfights. Take part in a war filled with tanks, fighter jets, and sweeping combat at a grand scale but remember: the deadliest weapon is your squad.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>It’s not clear yet when the game will launch, nor on what platforms, thought <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-release-in-october-for-80-leak-suggests-and-theres-an-open-beta-coming-too">leaks have pointed to an October debut on current-gen consoles and PC</a>.</p></div><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is also a massive production, being developed by four different studios under the banner “Battlefield Studios.” They include original developer DICE; <em>Burnout</em> and <em>Need for Speed</em> studio Criterion; EA Motive, the team behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">the <em>Dead Space</em> remake</a>; and a relatively new team known as Ripple Effect.</p><p>It’s a major moment for EA, particularly after the most recent game in the series — 2021’s <em>Battlefield 2042</em> — “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">did not meet expectations</a>,” according to the company. Battlefield 6 will be entering a market that is no less competitive, going up against annual <em>Call of Duty</em> releases, including this year’s <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and entrenched live-service shooters like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712936/battlefield-6-trailer]]></content:encoded>

The handhelds were $200 each, much more than the Android-based emulation devices currently flooding the retro gaming market. </p><p>The M64 will start at the same price point, however. “Inflation isn’t nostalgic,” Luckey quipped, noting that his Nintendo 64 clone will be launching at the same price as the original did back in 1996. It’s not the only device hoping to capitalize on N64 nostalgia this year, though. Analogue announced its own years ago and the Analogue 3D <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-3d-n64-nintendo-ship-date-delay-tariff-1851786334">is finally getting ready to ship beginning next month</a></span>, though it will cost $50 more than the M64. </p><p>That’s right, there will soon be at least two FGPA-based N64 tributes on the market. Nintendo now has the chance to do the funniest thing and finally release its own N64 classic fans have long requested. While diehard enthusiasts will still opt for more premium alternatives, it would save everyone else who just wants to recreate that old Christmas morning fun with a few rounds of Mario Kart a lot of money. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895]]></content:encoded>

While the two-minute trailer was more cinematics than actual gameplay, it sets a grim tone for the next installment.</p><p>The trailer begins with the US president giving a conference discussing a “dark day” in the country’s history after suffering a mysterious, unprovoked attack. We then see cinematic, in-engine footage of locations like New York City embroiled in all-out war, suggesting the conflict will at least partially unfold on American soil.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>According to a press release, Battlefield 6’s single-player campaign centers on a private military corporation called Pax Armata.

            <p>A book containing the video game scripts for both of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us games, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released.</p>
<p>The tome itself has the very appropriate title The Last of Us: Part 1 and Part 2 Scripts, and is coming from the games' developer Naughty Dog in collaboration with Dark Horse Books. It will be released on 16th December, though pre-orders are open now via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sec2002-20">Amazon US</a> for $66.63. I have popped a message over to Sony to get clarification on UK availability and pricing.</p>
<p>"Relive every climactic moment in The Last of Us: Part 1 and Part 2 Scripts, from Joel and Ellie's time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie's joy while petting giraffes, to Joel's heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies' hospital in The Last of Us Part 1. Then, dive into The Last of Us Part 2's dual-perspective story, including Abby's shocking introduction, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Along with the scripts, this book will also include a forward from Troy Baker, who among other roles voices Joel in the Last of Us games, as well as an art gallery with work by principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, and a cover with new art and block printing along the pages edges which have been designed to evoke "the franchise's iconic Cordyceps fungus" (see below).</p>

<p>"At its beginning, The Last of Us was a series of philosophical themes - grief, unconditional love, the relentless pursuit of justice - waiting to be shaped into a story," the Last of Us' creator Neil Druckmann said, via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-last-of-us-book-scripts-video-game-1236468201/">Variety</a>. "These scripts, written during the games' development, were meant to guide our team as we brought that world to life. They were never intended for public view - until now. For the first time, we're sharing them with you - hoping this rare glimpse brings you even closer to the heart of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and the world they inhabit."</p>
<p>Halley Gross, who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, added: "Neil and I had the honour of leading this story, but the truth is, it only exists because of the remarkable team at Naughty Dog. Every moment was built by people who bring their full hearts and talent to the table. This compilation is a tribute to the studio and a celebration of what's possible when we create together."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog is really getting quite a bit of mileage out of its The Last of Us games. Along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">TV adaptation</a>, the developer also in the last couple of years has debuted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">PC version of The Last of Us Part 2</a> (which followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-what-we-think-so-far">PC release</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-the-last-of-us-part-1-the-digital-foundry-tech-review">remastered release</a> of the first game in the series).</p>
<p>The team also recently issued an update for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode">allows you to play through the game in chronological order</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and the Battlefield Studios group has fully announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the next game in the long-running first person shooter series, but they did so with a cinematic trailer while teasing a multiplayer reveal for next week.</p>
<p>The Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal will take place on 31st July, one week from now. At that point we might also get word of a release date for the game – something which has been leaked/rumoured in the last few days to be coming in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From that, we can draw that everything within the announcement trailer was in-engine and more indicative of the single player campaign that is being developed by Criterion and Motive Studios. The trailer opens with an obscured President of the United States speaking from the White House podium about an unprovoked attack on Europe, the US and NATO by a private military group known as Pax Armata.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p>Witness the vicious path of destruction carved by Pax Armata, the world’s leading private military company. PAX pursues the destruction of NATO and its allies, stopping at nothing to uphold their motto: “Our Protection, Your Peace.”</p>
<p>Lock &amp; load for the ultimate all-out warfare experience. Fight in high-intensity infantry combat. Rip through the skies in aerial dogfights. Demolish your environment for a strategic advantage. In a war of tanks, fighter jets, and massive combat arsenals, your squad is the deadliest weapon. This is Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Little is known about who Pax Armata is, but from pre-announcement teasers, they seem to be backed by a growing coalition of other nations. Careful not to step on certain countries’ toes, this isn’t being labelled as a particular nation at this time, and is instead the “Pax Armata Mercenaries”.</p>
<p>Following this we get a look at a broad spectrum of Battlefield-like scenarios. There’s cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s clearly an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>
<p>The thing that has been most controversial, though, is whether or not weapons will be locked to classes or not. I guess we’ll find out about that in 7 days…</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-acknowledges-performance-issues-patch-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-developer-%E2%80%9Cdeeply-regret-s-%E2%80%9D-and-acknowledges-performance-issues-a-patch-is-coming-as-soon-as-possible.1252347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched yesterday, at the time of this writing, and in what seems to be a required milestone in the launch of any major title, it has done so with a number of performance issues. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">a new statement</a> from developer Leenzee Games, the studio acknowledges the reports it has received from players regarding performance problems and a few other issues with "<em>abnormal pricing</em>" and pre-order errors.</p>



<p>After thanking players who have supported the game and were there to play it on launch, Leenzee Games wrote that it has "<em>received reports regarding issues such as the game’s optimization not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>These problems should never have occurred,</em>" it continued, "<em>and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games adds that it is "<em>confident in the game's performance</em>" so long as your PC is within the studio's recommended technical specifications, but it is working on optimizing the game for the variety of PC builds out there. It also confirms that a patch is being worked on, and that Leenzee will release it "<em>as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games also quickly touches on "<em>pricing anomalies</em>" in some regions where the game is being sold, and just says that it is trying to work with Steam to ensure that the correct price is listed in every region. </p>



<p>Lastly, Leenzee Games addresses reports of players not getting promised pre-order rewards, an issue it also says will be fixed in its next patch. And as a sign of appreciation for its players, everyone who purchased the game on Steam is getting a free copy of the game's soundtrack. If you bought the deluxe version of the game on Steam, then you'll also be getting a brand-new costume in a future update, as another token of the studio's appreciation for your support.</p>



<p>A free copy of the soundtrack and new in-game cosmetics is nice and all, but what players want is for the game they purchased to run smoothly. Of the 8,000+ player reviews for WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">only 21% of them are positive</a>, with pretty much every negative review citing major performance problems. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">Francesco De Meo looked at WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers for his review</a>, he also cited performance issues as a key drawback of the game, and while it has a strong art style and some engaging combat elements, the performance problems aren't the only things players have to worry about in Fallen Feathers. </p>



<p>"<em>Uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-vtuber-world-is-in-crisis-over-%E2%80%98owed%E2%80%99-donations.1252344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>On July 21st, 6,669-year-old demon queen Ironmouse posted an 11-minute video, explaining that <a href="https://youtu.be/MwLbGcUMy6g?si=DmgFvaaqceo4XGaw">she is leaving her talent management agency, VShojo</a>. Ironmouse is a VTuber, or “virtual YouTuber,” which is a type of a streamer who doesn’t usually show their human face and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/vtuber-agencies-virtual-idols-global-streaming-superstars-1235387390/">creates elaborate digital personas to make content</a> instead.</p></div><p>“I recently found out that for the past couple of months, I have been misled by VShojo,” she said in her video. “I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds, which I have not been paid.”</p><p>With her pink hair, purple eyes, and horns, Ironmouse is one of Twitch’s biggest streamers. She currently has more than 2.3 million followers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse">Twitch</a> and 1.3 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IronMouseParty">YouTube</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/ironmouse-wins-content-creator-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2023/">she won a Game Award for content creator of the year</a>. A year later, she briefly overtook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/4/23820637/kai-cenat-ps5-giveaway-nyc-union-square">Kai Cenat</a> as the most subscribed to Twitch streamer, with more than 300,000 subs. Her VTuber colleagues at VShojo have follower counts in the hundreds of thousands across Twitch and YouTube. Now, in the aftermath of Ironmouse’s video, most of them have also quit the company, with some of them also alleging unpaid wages.</p><p>According to Ironmouse, her trouble with VShojo started with the conclusion of her 2024 subscription marathon on Twitch. During the event, Ironmouse raised more than $500,000 for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, a cause she explained was important to her as she — the real person behind the Ironmouse persona — suffers from common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to VShojo, Ironmouse, and the Immune Deficiency Foundation for comment.</p><p>“Because the money came from my Twitch revenue … it required VShojo to make the donation on my behalf,” Ironmouse said in her video. She claims this has not been done and that’s why she’s decided to leave VShojo:</p><div><blockquote><p>“And most importantly, the thing that hurts me the most is that the Immune Deficiency Foundation, which is the most important charity to me and also the reason why I’m here today, is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo … I really want to tell you everything, but unfortunately right now I have been instructed by my attorney to wait for more of the legal procedure to unfold. So one day I will be able to tell you the full story. But for now, I just need to let you know that I will no longer be a part of VShojo.“</p></blockquote></div><p>“As of right now, I am an independent VTuber,” she said.</p><p>While a creator leaving a talent agency is nothing new, especially in the world of VTubers, the scope and scale of this departure has had a serious impact on both VShojo and the wider VTuber community. In the hours after Ironmouse released her video, 12 of the 13 VTubers listed on VShojo’s website have officially announced they are leaving the company.</p><div><p>On July 22nd, <a href="https://www.vshojo.com/talent/kson">Kson</a>, a yakuza-themed VTuber with 1.3 million followers on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cBxw80mZoWI?si=x7vX9CYX3FfbM7bs">did a livestream in which she announced that she, too, would be leaving the company</a>, also alleging unpaid funds.</p></div><p>“And the reason why is because VShojo hasn’t paid a significant amount of money to me,” Kson said.</p><p>Most of the other VShojo members, who said they were leaving on their livestreams and social media, did not give explicit reasons why, suggesting that they aren’t able to due to legal reasons. Nearly all of them expressed heartbreak related to their departure and shock at Ironmouse’s treatment.</p><p>“Yes, I’m leaving VShojo,” <a href="https://x.com/ProjektMelody/status/1947667567440761307">Projekt Melody posted on X</a>. “I put my everything into this comp[any]. But I’m beyond devastated at what happened. &amp; I never in a million years thought I’d be saying these words.”</p><p>When VShojo was founded in 2020, it positioned itself as ”talent first” as a way to differentiate itself from other companies that had reputations <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065311/vtuber-selen-tatsuki-nijisanji-termination-dokibird">for treating talent poorly</a>. This attracted popular VTubers and huge numbers of fans.</p><p>VTubers operate similarly to Twitch streamers but can have extra expectations and constraints set upon them if they are corporately sponsored by talent agencies. To understand VTubers, it’s best to think of them as digital Japanese pop idols. Almost every aspect of a corporate VTuber — their sponsorships, social media accounts, finances, name, and more — is owned and controlled by their agency. In most circumstances, if a VTuber decides to go independent, then they have to leave every aspect of their persona behind, including all the channels attached to that persona, and start over from scratch. VShojo stood out as a company because its clients were not beholden to those terms.</p><p>“I’m actually shocked,” said Biggles, an artist and independent VTuber, who told <em>The Verge</em> that she’s been a fan of VShojo talent since the company’s beginning. “VShojo was a dream for many.”</p><p>Ironmouse’s dream for the Immune Deficiency Foundation lives on, however. After posting her announcement video as her usual persona, <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse">she initiated a donation drive to replace the allegedly unpaid funds</a>. Through her community, her former VShojo colleagues, and their communities, they’ve raised almost $1 million.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube]]></content:encoded>

But the Twitch star is part of a far bigger industry that spans various countries, cultures, and languages. According to a May 2025 report from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streams Charts and VSTATS</a></span>, the international VTubing landscape continues to grow quarter-over-quarter. While Japanese VTubers dominate the industry’s upper echelons, English-language VTubing is a core niche in the contemporary market. Meaning, if you’re interested in VTubing, now is the perfect time to start streaming.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Just don’t end up sticker shocked. Ordering your very own custom-made Live2D VTuber, or a 2D VTuber rigged to match a performer’s movements and facial expressions, can cost thousands of dollars. Many 3D VTuber commissions start around $1,000, with some high-end models reaching similar prices as their 2D counterparts. Make no mistake: The artists, riggers, modelers, and animators who make VTubing shine deserve every penny for their hard work. They are the backbone of this industry. But for newcomers interested in VTubing, it’s ill-advised to drop a couple grand on your first model. Cutting your teeth on something relatively inexpensive is best.</p><p>Luckily, VTubing is more accessible now than ever before. Plenty of pre-made models exist at an affordable price, allowing newcomers to express themselves creatively without breaking the bank. Programs like VRoid Studio even offer free model creation. And when in doubt, you can always throw a few images together and get started as a PNGTuber. Read on to learn the best ways to become a VTuber today.

Yes, this is literally a form of VTubing where you create content with image files. It’s incredibly simple to get started: Just draw a few images, hook them together with a PNGTuber program, and you’re done. I highly recommend this format for illustrators and digital artists unfamiliar with rigging or 3D modeling. Creating your own PNGTuber doubles as an advertisement for your artistic skills.</p><p>Using luna olmewe’s free program <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veadotube mini</a></span>, you can create your very own PNGTuber with ease. Simply fire up the software, go to the right-hand side, and select different image files that depict your VTuber with their mouth opened, closed, or while blinking in either state. You can then customize how your character moves when standing still or speaking. Make sure the correct microphone is selected, and you’re done! When you speak, your new PNGTuber will open their mouth. You’re officially ready to plug your new VTuber into your broadcasting program of choice.</p><p>Anywhere from two to four images will suffice for your PNGTuber. And for those who aren’t artistically inclined, have no fear. Many artists offer PNGTuber commissions starting at approximately $50 – a perfect option if you’re looking for a more boutique experience without breaking the bank.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unmatched-board-game-buying-guide.1252317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s a repurposing of an older game, Star Wars: Epic Duels, the Unmatched series quickly made a name for itself as the premier head-to-head skirmish board game after its release in 2019. Its formula of simple rules married to giving each character their own deck of cards, ensuring a unique feel and endlessly tweakable gameplay, shot it to the top of the charts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, its success has ensured that it’s spawned a dizzying array of different sets, all of which can be mixed and matched. After all, one of the key selling points of the series is that it lets you pit anyone from its bewildering array of fantasy and franchised characters against any other, offering huge replay value.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many sets available that we’re focusing on in-print ones for this guide, although it’s not hard to find the older ones second-hand. But if you’re confused by where to get into this exciting universe of carnage, or how best to expand your collection, we’re here to help with a rundown of the various options. Fundamentally, however, it’s a fantastic franchise with a strong core system, so wherever you start you’re unlikely to go wrong.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Unfranchised Versions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Unmatched box was Battle of Legends, which featured a variety of mythical characters from across the world. Even while it’s spun off into various licensed products, the series has continued to maintain this line and, unless you’re a superfan of one of the franchised versions available, these remain the best place to start.</p><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-1"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 1">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225691"><div id="225691" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It speaks to the strength of the series as a whole that <strong>the very first set that launched it all is still the best place to start for most players</strong>. You get four characters from a diverse range of global mythology: King Arthur, Sinbad, Medusa and Alice, of wonderland fame. Each has a unique playstyle which fits their background, with Alice able to turn from small to big for different bonuses, for example, while King Arthur can sacrifice his cards for super-powerful sword attacks.</p></div><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-2"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 2">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225695"><div id="225695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time Volume 2 came out, Unmatched as a whole had diversified strongly, so the designers had to dig deep to find some new play angles for the four included characters. The results are great, but not necessarily the best place to start out as they’re a bit off-the-wall and require some extra rules to learn. Sun Wukong, the trickster Monkey King, can create clones of himself to harass other players while urban Legend Bloody Mary gets extra actions as long as she’s holding at least three cards. It is, however, a great addition to a burgeoning collection.</p></div><p id="cobble-fog"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Cobble &amp; Fog">Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225696"><div id="225696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While this might not be the best place to begin your Unmatched collection, as some of the characters take a bit of experience to handle, Cobble &amp; Fog is probably the best box overall in the entire series</strong>. It features fighters from Victorian gothic fiction: Dracula, Dr Jekyll (and of course Mr Hyde), Sherlock Holmes and the Invisible Man. Not only is this an inspiring selection of very popular characters but they’re also well-balanced, with each bringing out their theme superbly during play, as we discussed during our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-cobble-and-fog-board-game-review"><u>review of Cobble &amp; Fog</u></a>.</p></div><p id="slings-and-arrows"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Slings and Arrows">Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225697"><div id="225697" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the newest sets in the series also has potentially the most surprising source, drawing as it does on the works of Shakespeare. It feels unlikely that the bard ever imagined what might happen if The Three Witches from Macbeth, Hamlet, Titania, and Shakespeare himself ever fought a pitched battle in his home base of the Globe Theatre, London, but now you can find out for yourself if you’ve a mind. It’s a really fun set but it’s also a bit too crazy for beginners, with the Witches throwing cards into brewing a potion and Shakespeare counting words on his cards to keep in iambic pentameter.</p></div><p id="unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze">Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225698"><div id="225698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales to Amaze is an outlier in the Unmatched world as it’s designed as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> experience, where players take a motley mix of fictional and real-world characters from a supercharged version of Nikolai Tesla to mythical flatboat captain Annie Christmas, and team up against either the Mothman or a Martian invasion. It works surprisingly well as a cooperative game thanks to tons of variety in enemy movement and minions and, as a bonus, you can also use the included characters in traditional competitive Unmatched too, although you’ll need a board from one of the other base sets to do so. It’s unusual enough that we gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-board-game-review"><u>Tales to Amaze a full review rundown</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Witcher</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ newest franchise is a biggie: the Witcher universe made famous by CD Projekt Red’s hugely popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-witcher">series of video games</a>. If you’re one of its legions of fans, these adaptations will do you proud and you can jump straight in. But since this edition contains three characters rather than the four in older sets, those previous boxes represent better value.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-steel-silver"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver">Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225699"><div id="225699" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the better of the two Witcher sets released so far, not least because it includes the titular Witcher, Geralt of Rivia himself, a powerful melee character who you can customize to some extent to suit your playstyle. He’s accompanied by Ciri, who can chain “source” cards to escalate effects, making for tough choices as to what order to play things in, and by The Ancient Leshen who has a terrifying card that transforms him into crows, allowing him to move anywhere on the board.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-realms-fall"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Realms Fall">Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225700"><div id="225700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Without Geralt, this box has to fall back on the famous sorceresses of the series, Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold and Yennefer of Vengerburg, except the latter two are presented as one character in a kind of double act: you can choose which is the main character and which is the sidekick. All have a varied and powerful mix of cards, as befits sorcerers from the Witcher world. Rounding out the set is the head of the Wild Hunt Eredin, a brutal close-combat fighter with powerful attacks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As if just having the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel</a> franchise wasn’t enough, these sets also change the formula of basic Unmatched by including item tokens. These are placed randomly on the board and provide minor boosts to the player that picks them up. Vanilla boards were the only weak points in the series so this is a good change, but it’s perhaps less well-suited for newcomers, especially since, again, these sets all have three characters instead of four.</p></div><p id="marvel-redemption-row"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Redemption Row">Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225701"><div id="225701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The best of the Marvel boxes is Redemption Row</strong>. Of its three heroes, Ghost Rider has hellfire-powered movement while Luke Cage is well-nigh invulnerable without some smart cardplay to get around his booster defences and Moon Knight rotates through different powers as he responds to the changing lunar phases. They’re all fun characters, well balanced out of the box and fun to pit head to head.</p></div><p id="marvel-brains-and-brawn"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Brains and Brawn">Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225702"><div id="225702" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Of all the Marvel sets this one probably has the most popular selection of characters</strong>. Spider-Man uses his spider-sense to force your opponent to show their played combat cards before you respond. She-Hulk has a mass of hit points and can discard cards to damage opponents and, last but certainly not least, Doctor Strange relies on a very fun and varied deck of spell effects to mess with his enemies. </p></div><p id="marvel-for-king-and-country"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - For King and Country">Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225703"><div id="225703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get the Avengers assembling with this box. Black Widow has a very unusual approach that sees her playing mission cards from among her hand, with requirements she can then fulfil for an extra bonus. Black Panther’s suit lets him steal cards from other players, and the Winter Soldier has enormously powerful card effects, many of which come with a downside as a result of his tortured psyche. </p></div><p id="marvel-hells-kitchen"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Hell's Kitchen">Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225704"><div id="225704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell’s Kitchen features some of Marvel’s shadier characters. Bullseye is a ranged monster, able to strike from an extended distance and with cards that can have extra effects when you win combat. Daredevil has a fraught and exciting push your luck element but Elektra lets the side down a bit with her resurrect mechanic: she’s still fun to play but doesn’t feel as varied or as interesting as the other two inclusions.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Two-Figure Sets</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the bigger boxes, Unmatched also offers smaller sets that only have two fighters. In theory these should be a cheaper entry point into the system but in practice, stock shortages mean they can cost you as much as a full base game set. </p></div><p id="robin-hood-vs-big-foot"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Robin Hood vs. Big Foot">Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225705"><div id="225705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cage match of the century that you never knew you wanted, both these characters are really interesting to play. Robin Hood has a unique hit and run style, supported by a band of merry men, while Bigfoot gets to draw extra cards if he’s alone in a zone at the end of the turn. This makes them good complimentary opponents but they also work well integrated into other sets.</p></div><p id="suns-origin"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Sun’s Origin">Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225706"><div id="225706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set offers two historical Japanese characters. Tomoe Gozen is a ranged and highly mobile character, who matches well against Oda Nobunaga’s ability to boost friendly melee characters. Both are hard to master so, together with the castle board and its interesting split-level setup, this is a better addition for seasoned Unmatched collectors than newcomers.</p></div><p id="houdini-vs-the-genie"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Houdini vs. The Genie">Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225707"><div id="225707" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A legendary magician faces off against a very famous fake magician in this pairing.

This trailer spotlights the game's campaign, which is being made at Motive Studio, opening with the President of the US speaking to the American people about a "monstrous, unprovoked attack" and how "no country is safe."</p><p>The developers previously spoke about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">Alex Garland's war movie Civil War</a> was an inspiration for the game, and it's not hard to see the influence of that film in this trailer. The trailer shows off a variety of locations around the world, including New York City, and also features the iconic Battlefield music, which is nice to hear. Of course, Battlefield's trademark destruction is on display in the trailer as well.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>But it's mostly about anime.</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Sony has whipped out its wallet and snapped up precisely 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco as part of a "strategic partnership" that primarily appears to be focused on expanding audiences within the realm of anime and manga.
</p>
<p>
The news, of course, follows Sony's move to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">become FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year. And while it might be tempting to conclude this new Bandai Namco is part of a nefarious scheme to lock FromSoftware in a PlayStation-shaped bunker, the reality probably isn't quite so Machiavellian.
</p>
<p>
Sony's decision to increase its shares in Kadokawa last December was - as with today's Bandai Namco deal - primarily about the anime market. In Kadokawa's case, it was said the increased partnership would allow Sony to adapt the company's IP (Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing) into live-action film and TV dramas globally, as well as co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, and more.
</p>
<p>
And it's a similar story with Bandai Namco. In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/">joint statement</a> announcing Sony's acquisition of 16m shares in the company as part of a new "strategic partnership", the pair wrote, "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."
</p>
<p>
This will involve implementing initiatives to expand the "works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising."
</p>
<p>
There was also talk of the companies "merging their strengths to create new and emotionally moving experiences for fans" in order to "maximise the value of IP" as part of the 68bn yen/$464m deal. There was not, however, any mention of a PlayStation-exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2.
</p>
<p>
Sony's recent anime-focused activity follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">$1bn purchase of streaming service Crunchyroll</a> in 2020. That deal, it said at the time, would create an "unprecedented opportunity to serve anime fans like never before and deliver the anime experience across any platform they choose, from theatrical, events, home entertainment, games, streaming, linear TV."

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has finally been revealed officially, courtesy of a brand-new trailer premiered on YouTube. A legal disclaimer URL featured at the end of the trailer may have given away a release window too!
</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows in-engine footage, but not gameplay. You see all the Battlefield staples: tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, all blasting away at each other and demolishing buildings. The trailer sets up a private miltary force called Pax Armada too, which appears to the be antagonistic force in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>.

<p>The trailer started up with a in-engine camera feed where discussions can be heard about various modern war talk, different countries, whispers about who isn't present in the room, and quiet chatting about the upcoming statement from the President of the USA. This then led straight into the trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Surprisingly, there was no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> announcement to be found in this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, but an update reveal wasn't far behind.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has today lifted the lid on the new 'Wisdom of Sea and Sky' expansion, which sees Johto's very own Lugia and Ho-Oh take centre stage in a Gen 2-focused set. The above trailer gives us a closer look at the two legendary ex cards, a handful of full arts and shinies, and, of course, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. All of this will be arriving in the Pokémon TCG Pocket app on <strong>30th July</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're very excited to see the new set in action (it's a good year to be a Totodile fan), the biggest announcement for us was the reveal that the in-game trading feature will be getting a facelift on the same day.</p>
<p>From 30th July, you'll be able to make a wishlist of cards you'd like to trade for via the My Cards screen, so other players can see what you're after and make you an offer. You'll be able to select up to 20 cards for your wishlist, and pin three of them to your profile for all to see.</p>
<p>As promised, Trade Tokens will also become a thing of the past, replaced by the much easier-to-obtain Shinedust (which you get as standard with any repeat card pulls) for three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity trades. You'll be able to cash in your pre-existing Trade Tokens in the in-game shop for Pack Hourglasses or Shinedust.</p>
<p>After months of hardly touching the woefully consumable-based trade system, we might finally start to fill in the blanks in our collection.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:185507,177763 @ 1753372863 -->
<p><em>Are you pleased to finally see the trade update come into effect? What are your thoughts on the next expansion? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-hit-10m-nightreign-at-5m.1252266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced new sales milestones for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, as well as the experimental multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and they're both doing very well indeed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has reached the 10 million sales mark, which means it's doubled its sales count in the year or so since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million in its first week</a>.</p>

<p>Since base&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">sitting at around 30 million</a> at last count, that means around a third of all&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>players have checked out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which is a pretty impressive adoption rate for DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nightreign-sales-scadutree.jpg?itok=R2fa6NYk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nightreign-sales-scadutree.jpg?itok=ki7xoilj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC has done very well for itself, as has spinoff&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, meanwhile, has hit the five million sales mark, so it's amassed another 1.5 million sales since passing the 3.5 million milestone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">back in June</a>.</p>

<p>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>may only be a fraction of its bigger brother's, but it's worth remembering that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't a mainline FromSoftware Soulslike; rather, it's an experimental spinoff that draws from roguelikes,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and games like&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>, so these sales are still pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>sold well enough to keep both Nintendo Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>and Hideo Kojima trip&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-june-2025-us-gaming-sales-data" rel="nofollow">all-format top spot in June</a>, so Bandai Namco has plenty of reason to feel smug.</p>

<p>The franchise's future is looking pretty rosy as well; back in May, a live-action movie helmed by&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Annihilation&nbsp;</em>filmmaker Alex Garland <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, so there's even more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>around the corner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales.jpg?itok=6zCvq6nD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales.jpg?itok=zF6uwv4H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a good time to be an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan.</figcaption></figure><p>While there probably won't be an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">anytime soon</a>, that doesn't mean FromSoftware is resting on its laurels. The studio is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a PvPvE game coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2</a> (yes, you read that right) next year.</p>

That’s how I initially felt about <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>. The high-fidelity trailers looked like an indistinct mashup of <em>Stellar Blade</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. Was it another Unreal Engine 5 game from a first-time Chines studio relying on aping existing formulas to capitalize on waning days of a genre goldrush? </p><figure id="" data-id="434d7ce250c34d1c4cbb085f242d7716" data-recommend-id="image://434d7ce250c34d1c4cbb085f242d7716" data-format="png" data-width="956" data-height="620" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a Wuchang post on X.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It may be the “Gooner Souls” of 2025, but that’s certainly not all it is. As everyone’s pointing out, <em>Wuchang</em> isn’t <em>just </em>more derivative Soulslike slop. It’s actually pretty fun and surprisingly deep. I’ve only played about five hours of <em>Wuchang </em>so far. I’m nowhere near ready to render a more definitive verdict on the totality of the game, but it has successfully laid to rest my initial fears and skepticism about it being a purely flashy yet hollow imitation of better games. I mean, it sort of is that in some ways, but there are some cool new twists to play with as well.</p><p>A familiar pace of combat—dodge, dodge, wait for an opening, attack—adds a resource called Skyborn Might that you build up by completing perfect dodges and parries (block to deflect or attack to clash and reflect the damage back). Skyborn Might is in turn used to unleash spells and more powerful attacks, which encourages you to constantly change up the flow of fights to optimize damage output. And instead of pouring points into stats every time you level up, there’s a <em>Final Fantasy X</em>-like Sphere Grid called the Impetus Repository, in which you level up individual nodes that each grant unique benefits. Add in a variety of weapons and armor to swap between, and you get a pretty fun combat loop that makes crafting a build feel less rote than in some other Soulslikes. </p><p>I’ve been playing on PS5, where performance has been fine (it’s also out on Game Pass today), but that’s apparently not the case for many people on PC at the moment. <em>Wuchang </em>is officially out today, and the Steam page is already full of negative reviews slamming the game for a lack of optimization. “Stutterchang: Fallen Frames,” wrote one user. “Stuttering, ghosting, blur visual, frame drop...well really bad performance with RTX 5070,” wrote another. That hasn’t stopped the game from hitting over 130,000 concurrent on Steam. </p><figure id="" data-id="765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-recommend-id="image://765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-format="png" data-width="1511" data-height="862" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Steam / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-recommend-id="image://765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-format="png" data-width="1511" data-height="862" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While some players say they’ve managed just fine on 3000 series cards, only 21 percent of the roughly 8,000 reviews so far are positive. There’s no demo either yet, so you can’t try the game out to see if it runs okay before buying the full thing, though Steam does allow refunds with less than two hours of playtime. “We are confident in the game’s performance within our recommended spec but we’re working on optimization,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560?emclan=103582791474575079&amp;emgid=498327923676151994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560?emclan=103582791474575079&amp;emgid=498327923676151994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Steam today</a></span>. “We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can.”</p><p>For those not on PC, <em>Wuchang</em> is definitely worth a second or third look, especially for Souls fans and anyone else not already completely burnt out on “another one of those.” I do hear it has some pretty absurd difficulty spikes later on, but in the beginning its pretty forgiving. At the very least, don’t write-off <em>Wuchang</em> only because it looks like gooner <em>Souls </em>bait. And unlike <em>Stellar Blade</em>, it actually has plenty of outfits that look cool and aren’t completely absurd. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856]]></content:encoded>
