			<p>This morning, Chinese developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://x.com/ZZZ_EN/status/1795304091759047142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its next game, Zenless Zone Zero, will be released on July 4 on all platforms: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401?af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> devices.</p>
<p>The free-to-play urban fantasy action RPG was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-is-an-urban-fantasy-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> just over two years ago. HoYoverse has since conducted multiple tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-beta-tuning-test-date-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC, mobile</a>, and, recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-ps5-tech-test-sign-ups-pc-amplifying-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5</a>. As usual for these games, a pre-registration milestone encourages users to pre-register so that everyone may get extra rewards at launch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/?no_entry=true&amp;reserve=true&amp;utm_source=sns&amp;utm_medium=CM_Twitter&amp;af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>'s counter says 35.7 million users have already registered, unlocking 30K Denny coins, 8 Master Tapes, 5 Boopons, and 1 Agent Corin. The next milestone is at 40 million and would grant another 12 Master Tapes.</p>
<p>Here's the official overview provided by HoYoverse:</p>
<p><strong><em>Two identities, one unique experience</em></strong><br>
<em>In the near future, a mysterious natural disaster known as the "Hollows" has occurred. In this devastated world, a new kind of city has emerged - New Eridu. This last oasis has mastered the technology to coexist with the Hollows and is home to a variety of chaotic, boisterous, dangerous, and very active factions. As a professional Proxy, you play a vital role in connecting the city to the Hollows. Your story awaits.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Build your squad and fight fast-paced battles</em></strong><br>
<em>Zenless Zone Zero is an all-new 3D action game from HoYoverse that offers a thrilling combat experience. Create a squad of up to three players and launch your attack with basic and special attacks. Dodge and parry to neutralize your opponents' counterattacks, and when they're stunned, unleash a powerful combo of chain attacks to finish them off! Remember, different enemies have different characteristics, and it would be wise to use their weaknesses to your advantage.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Different Factions and Intertwined Stories</em></strong><br>
<em>Random Play can't operate without videotapes, and Proxies can't operate without agents. In New Eridu, clients from all walks of life will come knocking. So don't be fooled by their innocent and cute appearances, don't be afraid of those who tower over you and look dangerous, and don't turn away the fluffy ones who might shed fur all over your spotless floor. Talk to them, learn about their unique experiences, and allow them to become your friends and allies. After all, this is a long road, and only with companions will you be able to go far.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-launch-date-might-be-announced-in-2-days/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At long last, it seems like the launch date for the Silent Hill 2 remake could very well be announced in two days. Earlier today, KONAMI <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1795228491539005800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed </a>a new Silent Hill transmission will be broadcast on YouTube on May 30 at 4 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>The Japanese publisher teased 'game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.' However, Polish developer Bloober Team (Layers of Fear, Observer, Blair Witch, The Medium) shared its own tweet, telling fans they are thrilled to invite them to the transmission. It seems like an obvious hint that we'll get significant Silent Hill 2 remake news at the broadcast, which, at this point, could only be the launch date.</p>
<p>After all, we know that Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-polishing-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been focusing on other projects</a> since the beginning of the year. Moreover, CEO Piotr Babieno <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-marketing-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said </a>the marketing campaign was forthcoming, signaling a launch in the not-too-far-off future.</p>
<p>Following several rumors, the Silent Hill 2 remake was finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-announced-will-come-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2022 to be heading to PC and PlayStation 5. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it will reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-will-faithfully-stick-to-the-traditional-story-canon-certain-areas-will-be-adjusted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stick faithfully to the original's story</a> while improving the game in other areas, such as visuals, camera view, and combat. The latter will benefit from <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-enemy-ai-is-fully-overhauled-to-improve-combat-devs-its-a-more-interesting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully remade enemy AI</a> to make encounters more interesting.</p>

<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, the upcoming action RPG from <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai</em> developers Hoyoverse, is officially launch on July 4. The “urban action” game will be free to play, and shall be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile on the same day.</p> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">To accompany the happy news, we also got a new trailer for badass wolfman Lycaon. The one-eyed lupine is featured kicking a bunch of ass while accompanied by some very sweet guitar work.</p> <figure data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Lycaon Character Demo - &quot;Wolfishly Charming&quot; | Zenless Zone Zero" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OqyvAXbgiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Zenless Zone Zero is set in a post-apocalyptic world where all manner of weird supernatural events have occurred. These events, known as Hollows, have destroyed much of modern society, turning some areas into unlivable zones. The last city, New Eridu, is a place of relative calm and peace, but only because Proxies, like the player character, work so hard to keep it that way.</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="907" data-injectable="true">The combat is my personal favorite from Hoyoverse so far, leaning hard into quick swaps between characters that play off each other through aggressive skill rotations. During technical tests I had a lot of fun with the slightly goofy worldbuilding and puzzle-based exploration as well. The game also has a fun and colorful aesthetic that pulls heavily from the modern world but with a pleasant blend of inspirations from past fashion and future tech. All in all, I’m excited about this one and am eager to dive in on July 4.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">If you like, you can pre-register at the official <a href="https://act.hoyoverse.com/zzz/event/e20240528landing-2byyms"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> website</a> to inch the community one step closer to a bunch of free loot. 36 million players have pre-registered to date, so there will be plenty of people to play with.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-disappointed-rainbow-six-fans-with-new-%E2%80%98r6-membership%E2%80%99.882570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/r6-membership-disappoints-fans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>This weekend, during the BLAST R6 Manchester Major, Ubisoft revealed the roadmap and plans for Y9S2 – Operation New Blood. During this short showcase, the team uncovered R6 Membership, a premium, paid-for offering that’ll reward players with exclusive benefits and bonuses in exchange for a monthly, recurring payment. I was on-site at the Manchester Major and can confirm that the jeering and booing that rippled through the building were indicative of the community’s response to the R6 Membership reveal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-way-to-go">Way to Go</h2>



<p>For the most part, the twenty-something-minute reveal went down quite well. Ubisoft’s team expanded on new Operators – Striker and Sentry – and broke down balancing changes, quality-of-life improvements, and the global release of the peer-to-peer Marketplace in Rainbow Six Siege. They talked at length about improvements to the player protection systems, and anti-cheat mechanics, and revealed more about the Operators that are going to be ‘nerfed’ slightly going into Operation New Blood.</p>



<p>When the talk turned to the R6 Membership, the crowd started grumbling. Despite the showcase talking positively (of course) about the R6 Membership, the crowd united in their opposition to the introduction. </p>



<p>For $10 a month (recurring), Rainbow Six Siege players will be able to access a ‘premium’ battle pass, exclusive content drops, and other unique cosmetic items like animated skins that are only available to those <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/50c0MbM9IoHbgjV8MeoiA3/r6-membership-brings-animated-skins-full-battle-pass-access#:~:text=Join%20the%20R6%20Membership%20starting,drop%20begins%20June%2028th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with an R6 Membership</a>. It was also confirmed that the R6 Membership will include a monthly allotment of R6 Credits, slotted neatly into the player’s in-game account to save or spend as they see fit.</p>



<p>It’s nothing that’ll make the R6 Membership a pay-to-win subscription, but there’s enough meat on the bones to make non-paying fans angry at Ubisoft for locking content behind a paywall. Ultimately, it’s the way of the world right now – this operating model is replicated in Fortnite, Fallout 76, Call of Duty, and Elder Scrolls Online, to name a few games.</p>

<p>Konami has announced ‘Silent Hill Transmission’, a showcase planned for May 30 at 4 PM PDT (1 AM CEST on May 31). The company has confirmed that it’ll share ‘game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.’ Fans instantly took to social media platforms to share their predictions for the event, with the most common theme being that we’ll get an in-depth look at the Silent Hill 2 remake.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-revealing-transmission">Revealing Transmission</h2>



<p>Several Silent Hill projects are in the works, and we can expect any number of them to be revealed or expanded on during this showcase. For instance, the Silent Hill 2 remake will likely get a) a longer gameplay trailer, and b) a release date – or better window. There’s also Return to Silent Hill, Silent Hill Townfall, and Silent Hill f – any of these titles could be touched upon during the Silent Hill Transmission showcase.</p>



<p>Some fans are expecting the reveal of a grand collector’s edition of the Silent Hill 2 remake, but there hasn’t been any news on that topic thus far. With Konami teasing an update regarding merchandise, that’s certainly possible – but elsewhere, we could probably expect some kind of statue or figure-based offering. There are more than enough terrifying, iconic characters from the Silent Hill universe to keep fans guessing until the reveal takes place on May 30.</p>



<p>We’ll have all the latest news from the Silent Hill Transmission showcase as soon as it drops – stay tuned.</p>

<p id="7e50o5">Mareanie’s shiny form first became available during the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2024/5/23/24163304/ultra-space-wonders-event-timed-research-stakataka-blacephalon-shiny-mareanie">“Ultra Space Wonders”</a> event. Toxapex (Mareanie’s evolution) actually does see some use in lower PvP leagues, so it may be worth having one around if you like PvP.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Mareanie in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Mareanie is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-r6-membership-subscription-service-boos/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rainbow-six-siege-unveils-a-monthly-subscription-service-sparking-literal-boos.882528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-r6-membership-subscription-service-boos/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Most long-running live service games eventually try to test the waters with a subscription service, even if the game was really set up for that initially. GTA Online did it, Fallout 76 did it, and now, it seems <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is doing it. For $10 a month, you can purchase an “R6 Membership,” which will get you access to all premium battle passes with 10 levels unlocked, time-limited legendary items, and more. You can <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/50c0MbM9IoHbgjV8MeoiA3/r6-membership-brings-animated-skins-full-battle-pass-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the full rundown</a>, below.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFrainbowsixsiege89.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“Unlock the ultimate Rainbow Six Siege experience with the R6 Membership! This offer delivers an exclusive drop of content every month, including a time-limited Legendary item (sometimes animated for extra flair), an Epic operator bundle, full access to the premium Battle Pass, 10x Battle levels, and a Bravo pack totaling over 4500 credits of value monthly.”</em></p>
<p><em>Reward Delivery Schedule:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Upon enrolling you get: Instant Battle Pass access, 10 Battle levels, and 1 Bravo pack</em></li>
<li><em>Then get a new cosmetic drop containing 1 Legendary item and 1 Epic bundle on the 28th of each month (first drop begins June 28th)</em></li>
<li><em>On your monthly renewal date, you'll receive another 10 Battle levels and 1 Bravo pack.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this R6 Membership, which isn’t particularly generous compared to some other live service subscriptions, has not been all that well received. Perhaps most embarrassing, during the Blast R6 Major Manchester 2024 esports event, an announcement video for the R6 Membership was played, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/rainbow-six-siege-fans-roundly-boo-the-announcement-of-a-new-monthly-subscription-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inciting widespread boos</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege Membership Crowd Reaction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouBGbKKq1KQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the booing, there’s still a pretty good chance people sign up and the R6 Membership becomes a quiet success for Ubisoft. Publishers don't do this kind of stuff for no reason. Of course, usual seasonal updates for Rainbow Six Siege will also be continuing, with <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/2L0bFvjA80swkS4EvawujB/y9s2-designers-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year 9, Season 2, “Operation New Blood”</a> coming up. This season will see Ubisoft Montreal begin the process of remastering individual Operators, starting with the OG, Striker.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege can be played on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. You’ll be able to sign up for an R6 Membership starting June 11 and Y9S2 should kick off around the same time.</p>

This deal only applies to the Nintendo Switch version. The compilation released last October. Solid deals up until now dropped the price to $40 (list price is $60). However, it's worth noting that the Switch version runs at 30fps, while other platforms offer 60fps. Otherwise, the included content and bonus materials are identical between all versions. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-89511462&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-is-only-20-for-switch-at-amazon%2F1100-6519091%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target already sold out of the $20 deal</a>, so we wouldn't be surprised if Amazon sold out, too.</p><p>Heads up for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners: Amazon-owned retailer <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1z&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-master-collection-is-only-20-for-switch-at-amazon%2F1100-6519091%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Woot is selling the compilation for $25</a>.

"There are other ways to play these games, but I think we often undersell the appeal of convenience. Being able to easily access them all on a modern console is a major selling point." While some of these titles might show their age mechanically, the overarching Metal Gear Solid narrative holds up remarkably, and many of its themes like digital surveillance, artificial intelligence, and weaponized misinformation feel more relevant than ever. Be sure to grab the collection while the deal is still available.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>When Studio Wildcard released <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARK: Survival Ascended</a>, its Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the highly successful open world survival game ARK: Survival Evolved, the studio bet heavily on the power of modding and user-generated content.</p>
<p>Studio Wildcard partnered with Overwolf's CurseForge to deliver these mods not just on Steam but everywhere, from PC to consoles. In addition to the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/ark-survival-ascended" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated webpage</a>, there's an in-game browser where users can check out the over 1900 mods available in ARK: Survival Ascended, which range from new weapons to new armor, creatures, and even fully-fledged game modes and high-quality maps.</p>
<p>Studio Wildcard and Overwolf did not stop there, though. They allowed the development of Premium Mods, and now nine of these paid mods are also available on Xbox Series S|X, with PlayStation 5 following soon.&nbsp;I've spoken with Studio Wildcard's Lead Designer and Co-Creative Director Jeremy Stieglitz and Overwolf's Chief Marketing Officer Shahar Sorek to discuss the importance of this landmark release and the role that user-generated content will play in the future of the games industry.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Mods are a great benefit. They don't eliminate the need for official content, but they definitely help make the game feel fresh on a daily basis' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First, let's talk about this partnership between Overwolf and Studio Wildcard for ARK: Survival Ascended mods. How did it come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> When we looked at doing a new version of ARK, we knew by looking at the original game that modding was very important for that game's success. But we asked ourselves the question, how can we make modding more of a core pillar of the game that will benefit all players for all versions of the game, not just the PC version, not just the Steam version?</p>
<p>In ARK: Survival Evolved, it wasn't even just that mods were limited to PC. They were limited to Steam. We had versions of the game on Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, and those versions wouldn't even work with the Steam mods.</p>
<p>We were looking at the limitations of Steam Workshop and really getting the sense that Valve had no plans to evolve it beyond that. Also, it was not just about making mods more available to a wider audience, but how we could make an ecosystem by which people could discover them more naturally, like in the game and really kind of relate it more to game logic and game categories and game flow, UI and so forth. But also, is there a way to make a financial ecosystem, not really for our benefit, but for the creators themselves so they can actually have an incentive to create higher quality mods, more ambitious mods, which benefits us in a fundamental way of increasing player engagement? Making more things for people to play in the game, higher quality things, especially because we know a key challenge with these live service games is the content treadmill as developers struggle to keep up with the amount of playable content that gamers reasonably expect on&nbsp;a weekly basis for these online service games, and that is very challenging for a small developer to do.</p>
<p>Mods are a great benefit. They don't eliminate the need for official content, but they definitely help make the game feel fresh on a daily basis. When content is created by end users, it's exciting.</p>
<p>So, all of that was so important to us, but here's the thing. We had no experience in any of that, so we knew that it was not in our capability to build anything like that. We looked around and it turned out that Overwolf and CurseForge had already been working on systems very much in line with those goals. At this point, I'll turn it over to them, and they can describe kind of what they have been building and how that relates to ARK: Survival Ascended.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>Thank you, Jeremy. I'll start from the top with Overwolf and Curseforge. We see a massive shift happening in the world of gaming, with the demand for in-game content and user-generated content on a massive rise. That's due to players wanting to play more experiences, but also to all sorts of other demands, the rise of user acquisition, which makes it very tough for developers to attract players, and the extreme costs of developing extra content. So we see a world in which by the end of this decade, the time players spend on user generated content and mods is way bigger than the time spent on actually playing the core experience of the game. We are on a mission to create an ecosystem and a marketplace to support that because at the core of what we're trying to do is say that modders are really developers and they should get paid for that, hence premium mods right now.</p>
<p>It's like when YouTube came along, people put up videos, and suddenly, there was this new world called streamers. With Overwolf, we call modders and app and private server developers in-game creators, and the number one stat in our company that we measure is how much money in a year we managed to facilitate and help these creators earn.</p>
<p>In 2023, it was $201 million. Our goal by the end of the decade is to hit 1 billion. Studio Wildcard is probably the number one studio that we found so committed to the creator economy. They share the same view with us. We think that each game or worthwhile deep AAA experience is a content hub.</p>
<p>We're on a mission to detoxify each of those games and to allow for tools, from the tech tools to the moderating tools, to discoverability tools, to help those games enlist what I call the creator Legion to help build within them and also for some mods to monetize them.</p>
<p>We need to remember that the core of the modding experience is free and will always stay free. Within that, we've decided to work with Studio Wildcard on opening a new creator category: the premium mod creator, DLC-level mod creator. This category can then be opened up to small game studios and really talented teams that could build DLC-level content.</p>
<p>It's a big win for the studio because they're getting a velocity of content on a whole other level; it's a big win for the creators because we can make money. It's a big win for the players who can discover in-game all sorts of new content. What's happening right now is that there are a few firsts in terms of tech. Getting modders to deploy on consoles, for instance, was nearly impossible because the consoles needed to approve the mod.</p>
<p>Together with Studio Wildcard, we built auto-cooking, which means ARK: Survival Ascended modders can submit the mods to us, and our tech takes care of the cooking. Now, deployment on all platforms is much easier because they have a mod that can be distributed or cooked at the same time for all these platforms, which wasn't possible before.</p>
<p>There's also cross-play, so if I download an ARK: Survival Ascended mod on PC and Jeremy plays it on Xbox, we can play the same mod at the same instance. These things are a first in the world of modding. We're going to see many more, I think, games adopt this and try to go for it. But this is all innovation within the UGC world.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>A small asterisk there. I do think the Unreal Fortnite Editor has a similar capability for cross-platform through Epic's systems. But I think what we and Overwolf have built together is more flexible in many ways.</p>
<p>Fortnite does allow people to use these PC based tools to create content that then goes on to the three main platforms (PC, Xbox, and PlayStation), but what you can do with the mods is currently much more limited. Epic hobbles various capabilities of the engine deliberately for quality control reasons. For example, they disallow access to the lower-level blueprint logic of the engine, favoring only a higher-level text scripting language called the Verse, which is kind of like JavaScript. There are lots of limitations with Verse, both functionally and performance-wise, like writing a game in JavaScript, which is not exactly what you want to be doing if you want to write a deep, high-performance experience.</p>
<p>The second thing is currently they don't allow mods to be directly sold. They only have an engagement-based compensation system, which I think is maybe appropriate for super creators, but not very appropriate for non-super creators. And then thirdly, just from a technical standpoint, they don't allow mods to interoperate. Every mod experience in Fortnite is its own self-contained thing, whereas the way it's designed in ARK: Survival Ascended is that the end user can mix and match mods in many cases to create their own customized game experience.</p>
<p>Some mods are standalone, but many of them are designed to interoperate. That allows more of a user-centric experience of exactly how you want to kind of customize your gameplay and what you want to add or remove from it. These are maybe fine-grained distinctions, but I do think fundamentally, Overwolf's and Studio Wildcard's approach is more traditionally mod-centric.</p>
<p>It's like what modding has been to PCs for many years, translating that to other platforms and also making an automatic compensation mechanism for the creators themselves. I think Epic has made many strides, and it's probably the most similar with Fortnite, but it is different and, in many ways, not as featureful.</p>
<p>Roblox, of course, is another example. Uh, mentioned earlier. What fundamentally distinguishes what we have done with ARK: Survival Ascended from Roblox is that Roblox is just a set of tools in the game to allow you to build environments and simple scripting within the game.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is cool for learning basic game development principles and for younger creators who are maybe just starting out and understanding what it means to create game content. But it's not really like game development end-to-end. The tools to make our content are located in a full-fledged, no-limits Unreal editor. That's full end-to-end game development. It's exactly the same tools and code that we use to make our own content, our own full-size expansion packs.</p>
<p>Modders can even literally create games that are entirely different from ours. We uploaded a steamboat Willy platformer as an example of something that has no gameplay relation to ARK: Survival Ascended. If they want, they can kind of wipe away all of our functionality and build something new, taking it all the way down to the foundational classes and building a new experience up from those foundational Unreal classes. With respect to Roblox, it's much less like actual game development and more like map-making within their existing game. People creating content for Roblox come up against the hard wall of like, I want to do this thing, but I can't because the tools aren't letting me.</p>
<p>That's just not really the case with what's provided here. We're excited to see and I think we've seen already that people have made more and more ambitious content over these weeks since the launch of premium mods earlier this year. It's getting a little bit more advanced, a little bit more ambitious, and that's going to continue to occur, I think, over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think content creation for games can be a job as this economy continues to grow. But if you did want to go work at a traditional development studio, if you know how to make Unreal Engine content, that is a fundamentally marketable and transferable skill' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The flip side is that you will need to be proficient in Unreal Engine development to make mods for ARK: Survival Ascended, which is not something every modder is familiar with.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Yes, admittedly, it's not great if you've never dabbled in game development before. You'd have to learn a lot. Your first step is learning Unreal, then. It is a more advanced thing. I mean, a lot of hobbyists are capable of that or interested in that. One nice principle, though, is if you do learn how to make Unreal content with the ARK development kit, you now know how to make Unreal content, which is a skill transferable to innumerable games or even a full-fledged industry job. However, I think content creation for games can be a job as this economy continues to grow. But if you did want to go work at a traditional development studio, if you know how to make Unreal Engine content, that is a fundamentally marketable and transferable skill.</p>
<p>If you know how to make Roblox content, congratulations, but that's only useful inside Roblox. I think this is a very important distinction for people who actually want to learn more about making game content with Unreal, as they can do that inside of ARK.</p>
<p><strong>I guess Microsoft and Sony still want their usual 30% cut, as they do with all regular DLCs, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>This is still all in the works. It's a new model, and this is the first time premium mods are sold inside. And yes, everybody gets their cut here. I still can't go into the numbers. It's all happening as we speak. I could just say that numbers-wise, it's done much better than we thought initially it should do. If it continues like this, we're talking about a new section in the industry as a whole because we'll see many studios adapt.</p>
<p>I can say that on ARK: Survival Ascended alone, we had close to 160 million mod downloads since we opened it up, of which I think around 65 percent have been on Xbox. In terms of how this splits, well, the platform gets something, the creator gets something, and then Studio Wildcard and Overwolf get something. You could think of it as a broad split right now until we're ready to reveal more of the numbers. But I want to tie it in a little bit to what you guys spoke about before, which is that this is opening up a new creator category. So now you can see serious small studios that, instead of pursuing a triple-A game that might take three to four years to make, can now create a DLC-level experience for a premium price in a much shorter time, meaning there's new revenue and new ways for them to exist. We're going to see many more small studios say, I'm going to upload a mod to ARK, and then maybe six months to a year later, I'll upload a mod to Fortnite or another of the games we're opening up later this year. It becomes a whole new way to survive and kind of redefine what a creator is in the world of games, which is shrinking as it did in this last year, so we're going to see new sources of revenue and opportunities for developers to find a way to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>On the subject of consoles specifically, I think it's important to remember that this is so new on consoles. I think Roblox took a step in that direction. Fortnite took a much bigger step, given how their tools work and the power of Unreal. But then this is kind of a third step of direct selling these kinds of premium Unreal contents onto consoles.</p>
<p>Previously those platforms, Xbox and PlayStation, were so locked down. User generated content was almost unheard of on those devices up until a couple of years ago in a serious way. I would say this is one of the last taboos to really fall with respect to the kind of experience or content people can get or play on traditional video game consoles.</p>
<p>What I think is really interesting about it is for hobbyists. People who may not have any console development experience or have not fully committed themselves yet to a career in the game industry. This is a great way to get experienced in console game development because effectively, what you're able to do is use a regular retail console unit like an Xbox or PlayStation that you buy off the store shelves and Develop your Unreal content on pc as normal using the toolset that we've provided. Then you're able to put that content onto your console and test it out, play it with your friends, and then even release it and sell it on the console without ever having to get development hardware, which costs many thousands of dollars, or become a specialized capitalized business registered with Microsoft and Sony. Going through all those steps requires six figures of capitalization, essentially.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>I wanted to add to what Jeremy was saying now and talk about compliance. There's a reason these platforms haven't opened up until now. This is another pillar; it's not a sexy pillar, but it's something we take care of. There's a lot of issues in compliance that would shut down UGC and have shut down UGC in the past. Moderation and curation for safety, what goes up, what can be exposed, because once you upload this mod, it gets distributed to all the players immediately.</p>
<p>Some things have to do with how that piece of content is handled from a compliance standpoint, which is moderation, legal, and safety. But also, with modding there's another layer of creation protection. There are situations where a modder will upload a mod, and that mod can be used to create other mods. So all these issues have been solved for the platforms by us. This is a whole other layer of procedural compliance innovation that had to come hand in hand with the stuff Jeremy spoke about regarding the technology and what it allows creators to do.</p>
<p><strong>That's definitely something I wanted to talk about. Curation is always an issue with user-generated content and certainly even more so on consoles. How do you handle that for ARK: Survival Ascended?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>Overwolf was built on deploying UGC about a decade ago. We have vast experience and a unique three-tier system of moderation and curation. First, we have an in-house team that manually checks every piece of content, and then we have AI and automation tools to check it. Then, we're in touch with the community, which also does this last test on it.</p>
<p>We've been able to tell and come to studios and take full legal responsibility for content being vetted and curated, which for Studio Wildcard and all the serious studios that have a massive UGC community and model community is a game changer because the studio needs to focus on making the best possible game experience for the gamers, and we take the responsibility of taking full ownership of allowing the creator economy and a creator community to engage with the game.</p>
<p>That's moderation, curation, safety, and market activities. That's monetization. All of that, zero to hero so that the studio can focus on the game. We enabled the legion of creators and everybody works with everybody. We standardize creation and monetization for everybody. Again, I want to stress that with everything we're doing, free mods are the core experience of the gamers.</p>
<p>There will always be free mods. We also vet the fidelity of content. You can't just upload something and put a price tag on it. It needs to be vetted and uphold certain standards before it goes live with a price tag.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>There's one thing that I would say is unique in this respect: as a creator, you are able to essentially get the tools, create your content, upload it, and test it out yourself and among a few white-listed testers without any roadblocks put in your place, without any speed bumps or gates, and that's very useful because it does allow creators to have an iterative pipeline where they're able to immediately start testing and playing their content on all the devices and refining it before they present to the public for, uh, before they present it for release review. Otherwise, if there was a gate at every step, it would be too slow. This actually internally allows a creator to just go make stuff, and then when it's ready, they're even able to test it on the console devices themselves. Being able to do that is such an essential bullet point feature that is highly reliant on the backend technology that Overwolf put together to make it possible to test out. You can essentially deliver the content to your own console via the system that Overwolf has created. It's really cool.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There aren't any hard lines on what to price what. Maybe there will be a mod that justifies $30, but it will be something that we'll all shake hands on it before we put it up' - Shahar Sorek</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I've read in your press release that ARK: Survival Ascended currently supports $2 to $10 premium mods. Is there a hard limit, or could someone make a $30 mod?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>We're all testing this in real time and live. There are mods for $2, $5, there's $10, and there's maybe $15. I think we need to see how the market behaves and how it makes sense. There aren't any hard lines on what to price what. I would say that when we come to pricing these mods, we work closely with the studio on what makes sense. This is not something the modder can just put up and say, oh, I want this and that. This whole system needs to reek of transparency and trust and that's kind of what we're trying to do. So, to your question, maybe there will be a mod that will justify that level of price, but it will be something that we'll all shake hands on it before we put it up.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>One last thing I want to mention is obviously one important thing to traditional modding on PC is that it's as open as possible. Notably, you can actually flag a mod when you create one in ARK: Survival Ascended as a PC-only mod, and if you flag the mod as PC-only non-premium, it just automatically goes up.</p>
<p>It can have after the fact review if it's offensive or breaks copyright infringing rules and so forth. But if you create a PC-only non-premium mod, then it behaves just like any open traditional modding platform, where you create something and it's immediately available to the extent you, as the creator, decide to publish it.</p>
<p>That is important so that people don't feel like modding in the traditional sense is now slowed down to a crawl. The speed bumps and gates are in place for the console releases, so if you flag it as cross-platform and you want to release it cross-platform, that's when it has to go through the internal review process at Overwolf. Thankfully, they're very fast and effective on that, but it is a necessary legal step for the platform to allow the release on consoles.</p>
<p><strong>I've also read that Premium Mods still aren't available on the PS5 of ARK: Survival Ascended. Any ETA you can share on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Yeah, hopefully in the next week or so. They are actively working on buttoning up the last few things with that platform.</p>
<p><strong>Premium mods aren't exactly a novel concept. Bethesda, arguably one of the biggest developers when it comes to modding, has already tried that a few times and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-pete-hines-defends-creation-club-fallout-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encountered a fair amount of resistance from the community</a>. How do you feel about that? Do you reckon most modders will continue to be against this opportunity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>I'll give my own developer thoughts on that, and then Shahar can provide his insight on it as well. I feel that that controversy, in particular, which has bubbled up every now and then, as you said, is usually around Bethesda. It's like every five years or so, there's a little thing involving it, but the last time I remember they attempted it was almost like five or six years ago, if not longer, on Steam Workshop, and I do think that player habits, consumer habits, and the whole industry have changed a lot in that time.</p>
<p><strong>They actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-new-update-despised/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reintroduced that in Skyrim a few months ago</a> under Creations, which includes both free and paid mods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Okay. Good to know. I had read they had actually reintroduced the kit. I wasn't sure if they had made the decision to enable premium capability on it. I think, ultimately, this speaks to the broader point that the taboo has shifted over that five or six-year time frame.&nbsp;People accept the fact more generally now that these mods and creators are getting so good, so in-depth, they are basically taking all of people's time to make them, and they can become a full-time job in terms of dedication to create something really great. It's ultimately a personal decision for the creator as to whether they want to put all that time in and then release it to the world for nothing except, you know, acclaim, which is great.</p>
<p>People love that. That's one of the reasons we make stuff: so that people can play it, say they liked it, give us feedback, and so forth. But if they really want to be able to support themselves and make it a full-time job where they don't have to do anything else for the rest of their days, that's just not possible unless they have some method of compensation. Epic has decided on an engagement-based compensation for now. there's also the idea of direct sales based compensation. I believe that players themselves, as they've experienced higher and higher quality content, know how much value it adds to their experiences, especially as the whole industry has shifted towards live service titles.</p>
<p>I believe very strongly that there's more acceptance on the part of the creator of players that this is a valid part of the video game ecosystem as long, and I think this is the critical point that Shahar was making earlier, as long as it doesn't displace that there's also free content. It's a personal decision really on the part of the creator whether the content should be free or premium. There'll be great free content. There'll be great premium content. If it was all premium, then yeah, what's the point in that scenario? You gotta have a good, healthy mix of both. I do think the premium mod taboo has essentially fallen. I also think it's fallen, especially for online service games.</p>
<p>I think if you have an offline single-player-only game that's oriented around a fixed set of content and doesn't evolve much over time, premium mods are a bit of a harder sell because, at that point, you kind of say, well, this is the game that I played start to finish and that's that. Why should I be compelled to play any further, especially at a price point? It's a little different when the game is constantly evolving in an online space and there's a constant need for more content and new experiences. That's my view on it, and the trends all have been pointing in that direction for a while, but now they're all fully oriented in that way.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>There are a few core differences, I think. Also, in terms of the experience itself, discovering mods in ARK: Survival Ascended within the context of the game lobby is a very different experience than going to a website and downloading a mod.</p>
<p>That allows us to create a lot more transparency in what is a premium mod and what is a free mod. It allows the ARK user to distinguish way more healthily the value of a premium mod. And that, on top of everything Jeremy said about the shifts in the industry, creates a valid opportunity for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Also, we need to remember that many of these creators are influencers. They have a whole community of players ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand that follow and want to create them in this space. This allows them a very specific in-game native in-world environment to deal with those who follow and love what they're doing. So, it's an ecosystem. It's not just that you're getting paid. You're getting another tool for your relationship with those who consume your content.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think the taboo has shifted over that 5-6 years timeframe since Bethesda first tried. People accept the fact that these mods are getting so good, so in-depth, they are taking all of people's time to make them, and they can become a full-time job in terms of dedication to create something really great' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What was the reaction of ARK: Survival Ascended modders to the premium mod news?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>Generally, it was quite positive. There was some initial reaction where they were like, that's a bridge we're not sure if we want to cross. I think that overall, especially as they've seen it work and other modders have now released their content using the premium channel, they appreciate if they do want to make money with the hard work they're putting into the process of making this stuff, that that option is there.</p>
<p>That's the best way to view it: it's an option. It's not like you have to do this. If you really feel that this is how you want to try to make money and spend your time, make a possibly even a career out of this, that that's now an avenue you can take, or if you just want to kind of keep it as a casual hobby. Though I would argue, of course, that many free creators spend all their time on it anyway if they can support themselves and how, you know, it's possible. But the option to actually make a living off of doing it is something that creators, on the whole now, have appreciated. I think it's a very positive outcome.</p>
<p>I know that players appreciate it as well. I'll tell you on a personal note that before I became a professional game developer, I was a modder way back. I started with Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, and Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2. Those were my three big ones.</p>
<p>It was around that time after Jedi Knight Dark Forces 2, which had a very advanced scripting language, that I decided maybe I could learn a little bit deeper how to make a game from scratch and try and make something commercial with the skills I had built up. But I will tell you, if I had been able to make any money to support myself creating mods, I would have been thrilled.</p>
<p>It was always interesting to spend countless hours. Thankfully, I was in high school at the time, so I didn't have to support myself with a job, but I did have a job doing web programming in addition to making mods. It would have been nice not to have to have an additional job on top of creating and just being able to spend all my time doing that and using that as an onboarding mechanism to more advanced game development.</p>
<p>I think it created a challenge of how you transition from creating mods to actually supporting yourself, kind of getting a professional job in the game industry. Frankly, eliminating that distinction is to the benefit of creators. Eliminating the distinction between professional job holders versus mod creators and saying, look, if people are willing to pay for your content, then there is no distinction.</p>
<p>That creates a much smoother, less binary on-ramp. You're either creating stuff for free, and that's all you can ever do, and you can make no money, or you have a desk job somewhere in a traditional studio. Creating such a spectrum of options between those two extremes is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p><strong>Some ARK: Survival Ascended fans may be wary of this initiative and fear it could take much time off your schedule to make official content. How would you respond to that concern?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>The good news is that we have a very large team that cannot all be oriented around mods. The content team, at the end of the day, is there to make internal content for ARK. The team associated with the support of mods is primarily technical. All these artists, all these level designers, and&nbsp;animators are here to make internal official content, so to speak. That's what we're doing. We have a big map release coming out in a couple of weeks. That includes new creatures and some new gameplay. We have a few surprises related to that down the official channel.</p>
<p>We still have to make official content in a very regular clip, but these premium mods keep the game fresh at an interval that would otherwise be impossible to meet or degrade the quality of our official content, meaning people can log into ARK: Survival Ascended every single day and find something new on the mod system and in the mod tab, they go in the mod browser in the game and they check the new releases every single day.</p>
<p>There's always some new cool stuff that serves as a daily refresher for players who want to vary their experience. We would never be able to achieve that internally, as our releases are tempo releases, with more monthly or multi-monthly instead of daily content.</p>
<p>It kind of creates almost two different categories or tiers where people can find new content in ARK: Survival Ascended, but I don't think either would work well without the other. There's got to be those major tentpole official releases, and there's also got to be these much more rapid creator releases. Both, I think, fulfill different expectations and needs on the part of players.</p>
<p><strong>Shahar Sorek: </strong>I'll add that 66 games take 80 percent of gamers' time playing them. Gamers demand a constant output of content. It really helps a studio that there's a constant stream of content going into the game, keeping the gamers in the game, not letting them drift towards other games and allowing for this very thriving ecosystem of content that keeps them engaged constantly. We're in a very competitive landscape, with over 14,000 games released each year. You want to retain each gamer inside your game. This is probably the best way to do it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I believe for these kinds of live online service games, modding is essential. I wouldn't make a game without this capability going forward if I had any choice in the matter because I think that otherwise, you're setting yourself up for an impossible task of creating content at a pace that almost no developer can truly achieve' - Jeremy Stieglitz</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Studio Wildcard is also working on ARK II, which, as far as we know, is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-2-delayed-until-late-2024-ue5-remaster-of-ark-coming-this-august-with-rtx-direct-illumination-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned to launch late this year.</a> Are you also going to allow these features, including premium mods, for the sequel?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>As a developer, I believe for these kinds of live online service games, modding is essential. I wouldn't make a game without this capability going forward if I had any choice in the matter because I think that otherwise, you're setting yourself up for an impossible task of creating content at a pace that almost no developer can truly achieve and you're stifling the creativity of your players. Not to mention, if you don't give them this capability, they will mod your game anyway. They're just going to have to do it with hacks and kind of reverse engineering, which is how a number of games get modded. But then you're not going to have any way to actually capture that enthusiasm within the game and present it to the average player.</p>
<p>It'll all just be like, go here, download the zip file, extract it, pray to God it works, hope there's no viruses inside, etc. That's not good for anybody. Either way, your game's going to get modded; you might as well make it accessible to the casual user to experience those mods and be able to kind of capture that enthusiasm more within the game ecosystem and just have it exist externally.</p>
<p>If you're not doing it for a live online game, then you are ignoring a huge potential magnet for players to continue playing and to stay in your game, as Shahar indicated. So, anything future that I do, we really need to have this as far as I'm concerned if it is an online game.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, I wanted to step a bit away from the topic of premium mods and discuss the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-the-animated-series-to-feature-voice-cast-full-of-hollywood-stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARK animated series</a> that launched a couple of months ago. Was the reaction to it as good as you had hoped?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>I'm happy to talk about it. I love the animated series. I worked very hard on it. We came out with that in March, and it was critically very well received. IGN gave it eight out of 10. They said it's the Jurassic World reboot; we need their quote. It was a lot of fun to do.</p>
<p>It expanded the world and lore of ARK and gave players a new way to get into it and feel immersed in that kind of story and setting. We do have plans to release part two of it soon, hopefully very soon. That is being wrapped up, part two, which kind of completes the current narrative that we had set out. It is in post-production, and then we'll see. As far as the critical and fan response, it was great, and it was nice to finally get the first look at it. Hopefully, we'll get to tell more stories like that in the ARK universe going forward, but I do think people will really like what they see with Part Two; it kind of pays everything off and really takes it to where it needs to go in terms of action and drama. So thank you for asking about that.</p>
<p><strong>I've always wondered how you managed to get so much Hollywood talent on board. There's Vin Diesel, David Tennant, Michelle Yeoh, Karl Urban, Jeffrey Wright, Russell Crowe, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Ragga Ragnars, Gerard Butler, Madeleine Madden, Alan Tudyk...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz: </strong>I'll keep this one very short and simple. Everybody was stuck at home during the pandemic and they had nothing else to do. They were very bored, and they liked the scripts. We got the scripts to them and I think they were going a bit stir crazy at the time. Lucky us!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has maintained its $70 retail price since launching in February--until now. You can finally <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save on the PS5 exclusive at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-rebirth---playstation-5%2F404626.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>, with both retailers dropping the price to $55 for a limited time. As this is the first discount since release, we wouldn't be surprised to see stock sell out--especially at Amazon, considering the online retailer is still giving away Final Fantasy-themed DualSense controller skins with the game.</p><hr><p>Depending on your location, you can get free same- or one-day delivery at Amazon with a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fprime%2Fpipeline%2Fsignup%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20%26tag%3Dgamespot-buybutton-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime membership</a>. It's worth noting that while free shipping is available for everyone at Amazon, ordering from GameStop will require you to spend $79 or more to get free shipping. That said, you could order online and pick it up at your local GameStop store. GameStop is selling preowned copies of Rebirth for $50, in case you want to save a little bit more and don't mind used games.</p><p>Rebirth, the sequel to Final Fantasy 7 Remake, earned in 8/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">our review</a>. "Thankfully, what Final Fantasy Rebirth succeeds at eclipses what it fumbles," critic Tamoor Hussain wrote. "It's a superbly designed gameplay experience that instills a sense of freedom while also making exploration rewarding in a meaningful way. Refined gameplay that makes character synergy a focal point breathes new life into the slick and satisfying combat, and all the while it reinforces the underlying themes of the story. As a game that has the unenviable task of living up to one of the strongest legacies in the medium, it is a worthy second chapter."</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth isn't the only Square Enix game on sale for its best price yet. Fans of Square Enix's best-known series can also grab <strong>Final Fantasy 16, the latest mainline entry, for only $35</strong> at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFinal-Fantasy-XVI-PlayStation-5%2Fdp%2FB0BPMTJJ6D%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-xvi---playstation-5%2F395062.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</strong>, a Nintendo Switch exclusive that has been largely unavailable at major retailers since its release last December, is back in stock and discounted to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C8VZXQYW%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$40 at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince---nintendo-switch%2F402991.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffinal-fantasy-7-rebirth-gets-first-big-discount%2F1100-6523738%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The RPG genre is host to some of the longest games available. However, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> is more of an RPG-lite, stripping out a lot of complexities and replacing them with simple action-based mechanics to keep it interesting. So, how long does it take to beat?</p> <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">This all depends on how much side content you’re going to do and how much you’ll devote to exploration, but on average, i<strong>t’s about 40 hours in length</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">In my own personal experience, that’s about the runtime. I didn’t do absolutely every last activity, but I did take on a great deal of side content, and that’s what I wound up with.</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">While <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is structurally linear, there’s a decent amount of exploration piled in there. On top of that, you might try finding all the tattle log entries, Star Pieces, or Shine Sprites. Or maybe you’ll battle down the Pit of 100 Trials to gain every last badge you can from the game. There’s a lot that can keep you occupied, even before you reach the credits.</p>
 <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">On top of that, the Switch version of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> piles on some additional content to the GameCube version to keep you satisfied for longer.</p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="false">If you only concentrate on the critical path (only the <em>necessary</em> parts), <strong>it could take you more like 32 hours</strong>. However, that sounds like a pretty boring way to play. It’s more likely that, even without trying to complete absolutely everything, you’ll hit closer to 40 hours.</p>

<p>Following the immense success of Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4 Remake, Capcom fully intends to spin up its wheels and pump out quality remakes, remasters, and mainline entries in the long-running survival horror franchise. While a remake is excellent—it hits right in the nostalgia portion of the brain—many of us want RE9. So, when is Resident Evil 9 coming out?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-resident-evil-9-come-out">When Does Resident Evil 9 Come Out?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-is-aiming-to-launch-january-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous reports</a>, Resident Evil 9 was initially supposed to receive a reveal this summer and launch in early 2025. However, recent leaks from <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075103169954210" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dusk Golem</a> on X (formerly Twitter) indicate those rumors were incorrect. The reveal itself won’t take place this summer but likely later, perhaps in the fall or winter of this year.</p>



<p>The leaks indicate that Resident Evil 9 will launch in late 2025 or early 2026. However, Capcom has yet to officially announce a release date. </p>



<p>Alongside the leaks regarding RE9, word also came down about a potential Resident Evil 5 Remake, which isn’t currently in development.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-9-open-world">Is Resident Evil 9 Open World?</h2>



<p>Many previous leaks we saw and reported on regarding Resident Evil 9 focused on its overall gameplay and setting. First and foremost, the word is that RE9 is going open-world, which sounds fantastic. Village provided us with a semi-open-world setting, with massive environments to explore, but an actual open world sounds genuinely enjoyable. That said, I’d prefer Racoon City. It’s said to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-location-to-be-set-on-an-island-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take place on a tropical island in Singapore</a>.</p>

<p>Can you believe Resident Evil Village launched in 2021? In 2023, we received Resident Evil 4 Remake, which led many to believe Capcom intends to remake or remaster the entire franchise moving forward. It’s looking more likely now, but what is the next Resident Evil remake on the slate?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-next-resident-evil-remake">What is the Next Resident Evil Remake?</h2>



<p>According to reports, it’s not Resident Evil 1 Remake or Resident Evil 5 Remake on the way next, but instead Resident Evil 0 Remake and Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake currently in development. Everyone in the community was so sure Capcom would remake the fifth entry, following the immense success of Resident Evil 4, and then return to the first game.</p>



<p>Resident Evil 1 previously received the remake/remaster treatment, but it kept the tank controls that feel archaic and unwieldy. If Capcom provides a faithful remake in the same style as recent titles, they’ll have a gold mine. </p>



<p>The same goes for 0 and Code Veronica, which have become fan favorites. </p>



<p>Either way, more Resident Evil is never a bad thing!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-resident-evil-9-location-to-be-set-on-an-island-it-s-claimed">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-location-to-be-set-on-an-island-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 Location to be Set on an Island, It’s Claimed</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-next-main-resident-evil-game">What is the Next Main Resident Evil Game?</h2>



<p>The next mainline entry in the long-running Resident Evil franchise, following the more action-oriented approach in Village, is Resident Evil 9. We’ve heard rumors it’ll take place on an island location with a more open-world approach, but there’s no official release date or window yet.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the only information we have about Resident Evil 9 is that it has been pushed back to 2025 or 2026. Previously, it was thought that the ninth mainline entry would receive an announcement this summer, but that’s appearing less likely. It’s still within the realm of possibility, but we’ll have to wait patiently and see!</p>

        <p>It’s the first glimpse we’ve had of the HD-2D do-over in three years</p>

            <p>It’s been three years to the day since we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-dragon-quest-12">Square Enix planned to remake Dragon Quest 3</a>, unveiling a revamping of the seminal 1988 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">JRPG</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>’s HD-2D engine. Three years have passed since then, but we’ve finally had an update on the remake - and it’s raised a few questions, to say the least.</p>

</div>
<p>May 27th, as I’m sure you’ll all know, is Dragon Quest Day, marking the anniversary of the first game in the series’ release in 1986. As such, it’s typical for Square Enix to drop some kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> news - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate">Dragon Quest 12</a> was revealed in 2021 alongside the HD-2D remake of DQ3, for instance - and this year is no exception.</p>
<p>What’s notable about this year’s tease - a brief video showing the outline of the Dragon Quest logo underneath the “The legend of Erdrick draws near” - is not only that it’s the first proper glimpse of Dragon Quest 3’s remake since its reveal three years ago (aside from some occasional comments from devs), but that a generous reading might suggest we’re in for more than we expected.</p>
<p>Drawing on the JRPG expertise and eagle eyes of <a href="https://x.com/APZonerunner/status/1795009812427641140">Alex Donaldson</a> from both <a href="https://www.vg247.com/square-enix-finally-gives-a-dragon-quest-3-remake-update">VG247</a> and <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/15857-dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-coming-to-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-nintendo-switch-pc">RPG Site</a>, the logo shown isn’t that for Dragon Quest 3 specifically, but the Dragon Quest series as a whole. More intriguing is that “the legend of Erdrick” might imply that the remake will expand Dragon Quest 3 - which is the third game to feature the titular legendary hero, but takes place before Dragon Quest 1 and 2 - to include the entire trilogy that makes up Erdrick’s “legend”. (Alex notes that the three games together are often called the “Erdrick trilogy”.)</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>In fact, the teaser doesn’t mention Dragon Quest 3 specifically, simply featuring the series name and logo, the badge for the HD-2D engine and “The legacy begins” - which certainly nods at Dragon Quest 3’s chronological place as the start of the story, but doesn’t limit it to being <em>just </em>Dragon Quest 3.</p>
<p>Now, all this should obviously be taken with a generous pinch of salt - we know a Dragon Quest 3 remake is coming, but there’s no official word that the other two games in the trilogy will be given the same treatment. Still, why not live in optimism? As the summer schedule of reveals and announcements prepares to arrive, it could be we’re in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p id="enGoPW">There’s nothing about the murder of Reena Virk (Vritika Gupta) that feels easy to swallow, and it’s a testament to <em>Under the Bridge</em> that the show has been able to balance the complexities of that reality in its seven episodes so far. Now, it’s coming to a close — one that no doubt will carry the weight of every ounce of tragedy in this story. </p>

 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Since there are no ongoing Partners events, prize drop minigames, or Treasures events, you won’t find any special currency during this tournament.

 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Shutdown – Blocked: Two points</li> <li>Shutdown – Success: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Small: Four points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Large: Six points</li> <li>Bank Heist – Bankrupt: Eight points</li> </ul> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">You can increase these points using your dice multiplier. Powerups like High Roller are especially helpful during events and tournaments, as they raise your maximum possible multiplier beyond its usual limits. </p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Although increasing your multiplier gives you more points per railroad tile, it depletes your dice quicker. Watch your dice supply and use resources like ongoing banner events and minigames to keep your supply as high as possible.</p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> game - the first new instalment in over four years, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a> - is reportedly taking a leaf out of Evil Dead: Army of Darkness’ necronomicon by transporting the Doom Slayer back to a medieval world to presumably battle hellspawn. According to a new report, it’s subtitled The Dark Ages and we’ll get an official reveal next week.</p>

<p>That’s all according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/">Insider Gaming</a>, who claim that Doom: The Dark Ages has been in the works over at Id Software for over four years now. It’s also said to be the final name for the game previously known as Doom: Year Zero, mentioned on a document from 2020 that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">surfaced last year</a> as part of Microsoft’s accidental leak during their legal wrestle with the Federal Trade Commission around the Activision-Blizzard merger.</p>
<p>Insider Gaming claim that The Dark Ages - as the name implies - will be set in a “medieval-inspired Doom world”. Beyond that, we currently know very little - but I do like the idea of the Doom Slayer clashing his Crucible blade against the swords and armour of medieval minions. Of, y’know, ripping and tearing through them with a whole load of guns.</p>
<p>Rumours of a new Doom game have been swirling recently, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-doom-reveal-hinted-at-by-zenimax-trademark">Zenimax registered a trademark for “IDKFA”</a> - harking back to classic Doom cheat codes - and multiple outlets including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls">Eurogamer</a> and <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1789625937480364356">The Verge</a> reported that a nuDoom would appear during the Xbox Games Showcase at this year’s Summer Geoff Fest, which this latest report claims to have verified. That means we should see and hear more in just under two weeks, on Sunday June 9th.</p>

            <p>The director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and CEO of developers Larian has revealed that the studio experienced crunch in order to get the sprawling Dungeons &amp; Dragons <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">CRPG</a> finished. While Swen Vincke admitted that “it would be a lie to say that we didn't [crunch]”, he insisted that it was less than on past Larian games such as Divinity, staff were paid for the overtime and it seemingly didn’t go as far as working late nights or weekends (for the most part, anyway).</p>

<p>Vincke made the comments during a Q&amp;A session at last week’s Digital Dragons developer conference, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GamesRadar</a> spotted, responding to a question about whether finishing Baldur’s Gate 3 had required the team to work excessive hours, as has become a common issue and criticism among <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-devs-deck-nine-accused-of-crunch-sexism-and-abusive-behaviour-amid-allegedly-toxic-culture">many</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-developers-allege-extensive-crunch-in-new-report">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-devs-backtrack-on-no-mandatory-crunch-stance-report-claims">studios</a> working on large blockbuster games.</p>
<p>According to Vincke, the crunch was “certainly less” than the studio had experienced before, but did occur when “things happen[ed] that we didn't foresee”. In an apparent relative improvement from the reportedly unpaid overtime of crunch in other companies, Vincke said that any overtime was paid, and that Larian’s building would typically be empty after 8pm latest. That minimising of overtime was helped by utilising Larian’s other studios <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">around the world</a>, letting the developers as a whole work across 24 hours on the game without staff in any one office have to work late into the night. Staff seemingly only “very, very, very rarely” worked weekends in the office, too.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-glow.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Larian Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Vincke’s read on the situation is that Larian didn’t “overly crunch” and that any overtime hours weren’t “as long as you would consider crunch”, while still acknowledging that there was at least “a bit” needed.</p>
<p>“To be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together,” Vincke concluded, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-crunch">plenty of evidence to the contrary</a>.</p>
<p>With the marked improvement on Baldur’s Gate 3 compared to their past games and what sounds like at least solid efforts to compensate staff and keep any overtime to a minimum, hopefully <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">Larian’s upcoming projects</a> - which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-dont-know-what-their-next-game-is-yet-but-it-wont-be-baldurs-gate-4-or-baldurs-gate-3-dlc">won’t include Baldur’s Gate 4 or DLC</a> - will see them find even more ways to cut crunch out entirely.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-review-in-progress.882357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A bunch of smarmy teenagers with ridiculous haircuts trying to escape the gloved clutches of an alien race of clowns is the kind of absurd and cheesy premise that makes perfect fodder for the asymmetrical multiplayer horror genre. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/friday-the-13th-the-game-review">Friday the 13th</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-review">Evil Dead</a>, and many more licensed games, the 1988 cult classic film Killer Klowns from Outer Space is the latest horror movie to try its hand at capturing our still-beating hearts with high-stakes murder sports. I need to spend some more time with Killer Klowns once its servers go live, but so far I can say that trying to either escape those deadly Klowns with my life or do my best to murder every angsty teenager in sight is already stupid fun no matter which side I was on.</p><p>Bucking the traditional asymmetrical structure slightly, each match pits seven hapless humans against three killers, as opposed to the usual four on one you see in most games that followed in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-review">Dead by Daylight</a>’s bloody footsteps. The Klowns are preposterously over the top, and run around turning humans into sacks of cotton candy with ray guns, hunting teens using a balloon hound on a leash, and mowing terrified victims down with an invisible car. It’s truly some of the zaniest stuff I’ve seen in a multiplayer game in a long time, and it never fails to make me laugh. I especially appreciate the little details, like how the Klowns’ shoes make a comical squeak when you walk, alerting everyone nearby to your presence and leaving cartoonish boot prints all over the floor. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Killer Klowns from Outer Space - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Admittedly, it’s nowhere near as much fun to play as a human because they’re just not as original or goofy as their pursuers. You mostly just sneak around searching for weapons, keys, gas canisters, and other things they need to mount an escape. However, getting away does have a novel twist, because none of the rescue options will allow more than three of the seven teens to leave at once. The boat can be repaired, but only fits three people, while the bridge exit is so rickety it could collapse after it’s been crossed by just two (if they’re not slow and careful as they’re crossing it). </p><p>In the roughly 18 hours I’ve played so far, this has led to several hilarious and tense interactions where someone on our team will panic and use up one of the exits to escape a dicey situation alone, leaving the remaining survivors in a lurch. Because there’s only four or five possible exits on each of the five maps, that makes evacuation for the remaining six humans a lot more difficult, and you don’t wanna be that guy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Amusing minigames let humans stay engaged even after they’ve completed their role in a match.</p></div><p>It’s also cool that if a human gets killed or manages to get out of Dodge early on, they’re given the option to play a series of simple but amusing carnival-themed minigames, like whack-a-Klown or a Simon Says memorization game. By completing these, they’re able to help out their remaining teammates with items to improve their chances, like health, weapons, or even a keycard they might need to escape through one of the exits. I’ve never seen something like this implemented in this genre before, and it’s a great way to keep you engaged after you’ve completed your role in the match – especially if you’ve got survivor’s guilt after taking one of the exits for yourself and leaving the others to fend for themselves.</p><p>It’s because of things like this that, even though Killer Klowns borrows a whole heck of a lot from the asymmetrical horror games that came before it, it doesn’t feel like an immediately dull carbon copy with yet another cult horror movie’s skin draped over it. Aside from the macabre humor, though, the biggest shakeup is that, with a full 10-player match, there’s a whole lot more action happening around the map at all times. As a human, you might find yourself coordinating with a small group of survivors to repair a boat to make an escape, while another posse across the map stages a daring rescue attempt to free an ally that’s been cocooned in cotton candy and is slowly being turned into Klown juice. Meanwhile, as a Klown, you might find yourself hunting down and killing a teenager hiding in a porta-potty, while elsewhere your two allies are collecting cotton candy to power their Klown machines in order to trigger the Klownpocalypse and win the match. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It feels a lot more chaotic and casual compared to a single bad guy slowly stalking the halls.</p></div><p>Compare that to a single bad guy slowly stalking the halls trying to kill everyone and Killer Klowns feels a lot more chaotic and casual, which fits pretty appropriately with its silly-as-heck vibe. With so much going on in every match, the vast majority of them end with at least a few humans making a successful escape while Klowns cull the weak, whereas the Klowns almost always get at least a few kills, which makes things feel a lot less sweaty. </p><p>Another way it achieves that is that the humans are able to fight back and even kill Klowns relatively easily once they find the right weapons. A solo Klown chasing a squad of four humans is likely to be in quite a pickle once those teens realize they can just turn around and wail on the grinning goof with axes and baseball bats until it’s forced to spend a minute in timeout before respawning. (And there’s no carnival games for you, ineffective Klown!) But because Klowns don’t have to loot to be powerful, don’t run out of ammo, and only die temporarily, there’s still a ton of reasons for humans to fear their wacky assailants, especially since ammo is scarce and human weapons break after just a few swings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This means that both teams, Klowns and humans, have to work together to achieve victory – and my experience so far has been that whichever side forms a more cohesive unit is likely to win. That’s exactly what I want in a game like this, and it’s absolutely fantastic. It’s an all too common problem for asymmetrical games to become one-sided when it’s one baddie versus a group of survivors. But in Killer Klowns nobody can really go it alone, and I’ve been seeing a lot more close matches and interesting interactions than I’d usually expect.</p><p>What I did expect, of course, is that Killer Klowns would have unlockables that are earned by playing matches, including both cosmetic stuff for pure flair and, for the Klowns at least, new character classes and abilities that can have a very real impact in-game. You can get the beefy Tank class that has health to spare, or the small but mighty Brawler, who moves in quickly and uses boxing gloves to knock the snot out of any annoying adolescents. Meanwhile, the humans unlock different archetypes with names like Rebellious and Tough, which are descriptions that sound like they’re supposed to influence how they play but, as of now, don’t appear to. Still, unlocking the various Klown classes has really helped inject some variety into my time so far, and most of them feel great. My new favorite is the Tracker, who is an expert at sniffing out slippery earthlings and turning them into spools of sugar with his shotgun.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Asymmetrical Multiplayer Games</h3><p>If you're a fan of games with a less traditional approach to multiplayer, here are Travis Northup's top asynchronous recommendations. </p></div><p>The biggest issue I’ve come across has been the stability of the matches themselves, which is always an enormous bummer in an otherwise solid multiplayer game. I and everyone I’ve played with have consistently experienced multiple crashes and a variety of irritating bugs throughout our matches, many of which have ended abruptly when the servers suddenly went haywire and booted everyone back to the main menu, leaving the entire Discord chat screaming with the rage and disappointment of a party that’s been fouled. Time will tell if these issues persist after the day one patch, but I’m currently pretty concerned that we’re careening toward a rocky launch, and these issues have significantly taken the wind out of our collective whoopie cushion.</p><p>So I still have a fair amount more to play of Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game before I put a final score on it - and I’ll especially keep an eye on its live servers once it fully launches. Here’s hoping the issues I’ve seen get smoothed out quickly, because I’d very much like to get back to the business of hunting down naive teens and evading evil Klowns. We’ll see if that holds up, and I’ll be back with a final review before too long. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Steam Support’s answer confirmed that, nope, both accounts and games on Steam are non-transferrable, so they can’t grant access to someone else or merge your library into another account in the same way as handing down your records or forcing someone to take possession of your lifelong collection of novelty steins.</p>
<p>If you were thinking “well, I’ll just leave them my password instead”, technically you’re not allowed to do that either. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam’s terms and conditions</a> specify that “you may not reveal, share, or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve”. (That officially includes by writing your password down, as the terms point out later on.) While Valve might arguably be swayed by your heartfelt plea to hand on the complete Leisure Suit Larry series to your loved ones, by the letter of the Subscriber Agreement, you’d have to get explicit permission first.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, literally writing down your password on a bit of paper and giving it to someone is something that Valve is unlikely to ever know about, even if it technically breaks the user terms - something you might not be so fussed about once you’re dead. Steam has also introduced its own built-in ways of sharing your game library with family members, with the added benefit that they can then play on their own account rather than giving your friends list a shock when you log in after passing on. But in terms of easy, convenient ways to hand on your digital game library, it seems there isn’t one at the moment. Best achievement-hunt while you can.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise to anyone that nearly a decade later, Rainbow Six: Siege continues to bring in crowds of people. It’s such a winning formula that, even for those who aren’t competitive, you can’t help but check out the most recent content or watch a competitive tournament. But there’s always more on the horizon. So, when does the new Rainbow Six Siege season start?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-season-of-rainbow-six-siege">When is the Next Season of Rainbow Six Siege?</h2>



<p>The upcoming season of Rainbow Six Siege, revealed recently as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-operation-new-blood-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation New Blood</a>, will kick off sometime in June. Unfortunately, no one has an exact date yet. What we do know is that Ubisoft generally follows a set schedule for seasonal releases around this time. </p>



<p>Following BLAST R6 Major Manchester, which concluded on May 26, the next season of Rainbow Six Siege will enter its test phase on the beta branch for approximately two weeks. Following this testing period, we’ll see the next Rainbow Six Siege season start. If the timeframe remains similar to previous years, then Operation New Blood begins in mid-June.</p>







<p>What’s New in Rainbow Six Siege Operation New Blood?</p>



<p>While the list of changes to Rainbow Six Siege in Operation New Blood proves extensive, we’ll focus on the biggest, most hard-hitting tweaks coming to the 5×5 game!</p>



<ul>
<li>Boost to anti-cheat and player protection mechanics</li>



<li>Fenrir and Solis nerfs</li>



<li>Full launch of the Rainbow Six Siege Marketplace</li>



<li>Warm-up game mode Endless Drill</li>



<li>Arcade game mode Attrition</li>



<li>New Recruits: Striker and Sentry</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-teaser-90s-gulf-war-confirmed-frank-woods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For some time now, we’ve been hearing two key rumors about 2024’s entry in the blockbuster Call of Duty franchise – a) that it would be a continuation of the Black Ops series developed by Treyarch, and b) that it would be set during the 90s with the first Gulf War being a focal point. Well, last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> was <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially announced as this year’s CoD title</a>, and now a new live-action teaser has essentially confirmed that 90s Gulf War setting.</p>
<p>A new teaser trailer posted to the Call of Duty YouTube channel entitled “Open your eyes” hits the player with a barrage of 90s imagery, from Chia Pets, to Bill Clinton, to George Bush (the first one). Perhaps most notably, there are also lots of snippets of the Gulf War and few sightings of Saddam Hussein. Since this is a Black Ops teaser, there’s also a conspiratorial tone, and hey, Treyarch will certainly have a wide choice of conspiracy theories to pick from regarding the Gulf War. Oh, and the teaser also contains a snippet of a cheesy 90s drama called “Frank’s Woods,” so you know he’s coming back (not that there was much doubt about that). Anyways, enough of my preamble, check out the teaser for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="open your eyes #thetruthlies" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEjmwoVrF0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Call of Duty YouTube channel is also promising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V08UPqchVgQ&amp;ab_channel=CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another live action Black Ops 6 trailer will drop tomorrow</a>. The cover image seems to show Saddam Hussein and some coordinates that point to his former palace, perhaps hinting that’s somewhere players will visit?</p>
<p>We’ll get our first real look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 following Microsoft’s big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, which takes place on June 9. Mark your calendars.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 platforms haven’t been announced, but it’s expected to come to the regular lineup, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-6-ps4-xo-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation and last-gen consoles</a>. It’s also expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on Game Pass</a>. What do you think? Up for a little 90s nostalgia? Or would you prefer a different time period?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/27/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The 80s was a great time for fans of slasher films and horror in general, but I’d never heard of Killer Klowns from Outer Space before seeing the modern game trailer for the first time. I did know IllFonic, though, as the custodians of the late <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/friday-the-13th/">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, the more recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/predator-hunting-grounds-review-ps4-pc/">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a> and a number of other asymmetrical multiplayer games.</p>
<p><iframe title="How To Survive A Killer Klowns Invasion" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dq3NrszLYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was admittedly a little dubious, with some of IllFonic’s licensed games significantly better than others. Friday the 13th was a decent jaunt, sadly passing on with its support ending, but Predator: Hunting Grounds didn’t live up to its expectations. Thankfully for the potential longevity of this game, the film creators, the Chiodo Brothers, seem very on board with making this game a success, talking about how they want to expand the universe of Killer Klowns in a way they were never able to do before with the original movie. Of course, it helps that the game feels like a real winner.</p>


<p>Each match pits three extraterrestrial Klowns against seven humans, with the human players trying to escape the map and the Klowns hunting them down and trying to bring about the Klownpocalypse. It could easily have fit exactly into the formula of all the other asymmetrical multiplayer horrors, but the humans here can fight back, making this very much a battle of&nbsp;attrition compared to the oppressive nature of Killers vs Survivors in Dead by Daylight.</p>


<p>Case in point, I was able to get very tooled up very early as a human in one match – I found a shotgun, some bullets and a handgun – and managed to take down two out of three Klowns in a fight before being killed myself. I like this because it means you don’t have to fear for your life in each game as a human, and alongside various rescue and resurrection options, gives your team a fighting chance even with some early set backs.</p>
<p>On both sides, communication is key and the game is as authentic as possible with in-game proximity chat for humans that all nearby players can hear, while the Klowns can chat at range with… telepath, maybe. It forces would be survivors to explore and try to find your comrades so you can see what items they found and actively work together to escape.</p>
<p>Each map has up to four escape points for which you’ll need to find specific items to open and make a getaway. For instance, the boat requires having its gas tank filled, a spark plug installed and its engine started, each process requiring a skill check (timed button press) to not make noise that alerts Klowns across the map. There’s also the fact that these exits might be coated in a thick layer of candy floss which will need to be removed before you can get out – the Klowns can reapply the coating with their various ridiculous guns, as well.</p>

<p>Dotted around the map are a metric ton of pickups to find; baseballs, hamburgers, a compass, energy drinks, weapons and so much more, all of which are useful at some point during the match. I tried to keep an energy drink on me in case I got discovered by a Klown, necking the energy drink in order to boost my stamina and make a getaway</p>
<p>There are currently five different archetypes to select from; Athletic, Rebellious, Heroic, Resourceful and Tough, each one varying in stats. The Athletic type for instance has a higher stamina stat meaning they can run for longer, while the Tough type has better health.</p>
<p>There’s also currently five different types of Klown, coming with their own unique stats, weapons and skills. The Ranger comes with a cool ability which lets you hypnotise Humans into walking towards gormlessly awaiting an untimely death, while the Tracker can create an awesome Balloon Dog that will pull you in the direction of where Humans are hiding, meaning you are never truly safe from from the Klowns wrath. These abilities are not tied to the specific Klowns either, because after unlocking them, you can mix and match the abilities and guns.</p>

<p>Klowns can generally have hunt down survivors without fear and preventing them from escaping, either by killing them outright, or by using them to trigger an early Klownpocalypse – this happens once the fifteen minute timer runs out, giving one last ditch escape opportunity before the map is covered in cotton candy.</p>
<p>You can get an early Klownpocalypse by hooking up big cotton candy cocoons – either spare ones or created using downed humans – to lackey generators around the map. Each machine has four spaces, and hooking up sixteen of them will trigger an early end game. In the meantime, they will also spawn minions that roam the map, exposing the positions of humans and trying to grapple and hold them for you, making them far easier to shoot and turn into candy… or for performing a Klownality on them.&nbsp;My personal favourite is the pie finisher, where you throw an impossible amount of pies at the poor Human, before topping them off with a cherry.</p>
<p>It’s all very tongue-in-cheek which is very in keeping with the theme of the original movie. It was a horror comedy and that very much feels like the vibe here. The game is not trying to take itself too seriously and be a complete horror experience and is instead focusing on just trying to be fun. Dead by Daylight could learn from this, such as by having an in-game timer to prevent games being held hostage by toxic players.</p>
<p>The game also encourages players to stick around after death. Klowns will respawn, but humans are given minigames to complete, which reward items that you can either pass to living players, or fill your own inventory if you’re hoping for a rescue or resurrection. Some minigames feel better than others,, though success is just about reducing the time before you get a reward. The resurrection machine is a fantastic inclusion that should help massively towards the ‘entitled survivor’ that’s cropping up in these kinds of games recently.</p>

<p>It’s worth a mention, but after watching the movie between sessions playing the game, I was impressed by how accurate the game actually is, right down to how you knock a Klown out – first by stunning them and then by popping their nose – and the way it disappears. It’s very smartly done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately our time with Killer Klowns before launch was not without issues. Admittedly playing before the day one patch, we had issues with disconnections, various bugs and glitches, all of which soured the experience a little. Hopefully all of the worst issues have been addressed with the day one patch – the reason why were are not scoring this review just yet is so we can try this out – because the game is a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to compare this game to the rest of IllFonic’s releases, and for all intents and purposes, it feels like a reskin that jumbles up the player count and some other gameplay tweaks. Saying that alone doesn’t do this game justice or feel fair, though. Killer Klowns definitely feels like an evolution of the system and is much more fun to play as a result. While not quite as good or as polished as Dead by Daylight, Killer Klowns still has a place in this genre without stepping on anything’s toes or replacing them.</p>
<p><em>We will update this review after the game is publicly available and we’ve tested the live servers and day one update. Code was provided by IllFonic for the purposes of this review.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation Showcase may be planned for September to follow this month's rumored State of Play presentation, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Lunatic Ignus, who previously revealed a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-short-but-sweet-new-trailer/">Black Myth: Wukong trailer</a> would be shared earlier this month before it actually went live, said on<a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1795026168610979929"> X/Twitter</a> today that a new PlayStation Showcase will be held in September.</p>
<p>While it will be some time until we learn if a new PlayStation Showcase will indeed be held this September, it makes a lot of sense for Sony to hold one that month. Not only is it the month of the Tokyo Game Show, but it would also be the perfect time to reveal the PlayStation 5 Pro and use upcoming games to showcase the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-36-teraflops/">power of the new system</a> closer to its launch, which is said to be before the end of the year. Still, no matter how likely it sounds, we should take a showcase coming this September with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/">PlayStation Showcase was long rumored to be planned for May</a>, but according to various insiders, this month's event will only be a State of Play presentation. As Memorial Day is celebrated in the US today, if any presentation will be held before the end of May, it will likely be announced tomorrow.</p>
