<p>Johnny Silverhand and Jackie Welles have joined the <a href="https://tubbz.com/">Tubbz</a> range of collectable characters, each notable for their duck-like qualities.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-features-in-the-xbox-game-dev-kit-further-point-to-next-gen-xbox-being-a-pc-console-hybrid.1348729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Officially, we don't have a concrete idea of what the next generation of console hardware will look like from either PlayStation or Xbox. Unofficially, at least on the Xbox side of things, we're seeing plenty of hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">what's in store for the next-gen Xbox is a sort of PC/console hybrid</a>, a device that will try to take the flexibility of PC when it comes to having your <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">gaming library from multiple launchers and digital stores available,</a> with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">ease-of-use that comes with a console</a>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-preparing-for-next-gen-with-a-ton-of-new-xbox-gdk-dev-features-heres-whats-new">Windows Central</a>, the new features added to the Xbox Game Development Kit (Xbox GDK) point to Microsoft and Xbox preparing for that rumored future device, with a few standout features which, if you think about how developers and players would use them, you'd end up asking yourself, 'why add this feature if not to prepare for a future where the next Xbox is essentially a PC?'</p>



<p>A nearly 10-minute video from the Microsoft Game Dev YouTube channel goes into great detail on the key features in the October 2025 GDK update, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What's new in the October 2025 GDK" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xD7xrh8DHjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some of the key features highlighted in the video include PlayFab Game Saves, which is a feature that lets players access their game save files between Xbox and Steam. Yes, individual games already support cross-progression between PC and consoles, but those all use their own individual systems. This is closer to an extension of Xbox's Cloud Save solution, but including game saves from Steam as well, with plans to add more platforms in the future.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Package Manager is another noteworthy feature, because it is intended to help developers streamline the process for supporting Microsoft's Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which is a key element to Xbox expanding its reach to let players play their games where they want, whether through Cloud Gaming, PC, console, or PC handheld devices like the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</p>



<p>Another new feature, Cross-Platform Gaming Runtime, is specifically meant to make it easier for developers to let players send game invites through Xbox's social features while playing games on other platforms. Essentially, letting someone on Steam send you an invite through your Xbox invites. Lastly, GameInput is a feature intended to unify controller models from your controller, keyboard and mouse under one interface, and featuring full parity with PC. </p>



<p>Again, none of this necessarily confirms that the next-gen Xbox will be the PC/console hybrid that's been rumored, but features like PlayFab Game Saves and Cross-Platform Gaming Runtime lead you to wonder why they'd be implemented at all if not for this next-gen Xbox/PC. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Reported Warhammer MMO Studio Becomes Yet Another NetEase Casualty]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-mmo-jackalyptic-games-shutdown-netease</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reported-warhammer-mmo-studio-becomes-yet-another-netease-casualty.1348726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jackalyptic Games, the studio purportedly responsible for developing an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO, has become yet another casualty of parent company NetEase.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackalyptic-games_im-here-to-share-a-note-that-after-nearly-activity-7392684257858494464-6uB8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a>, CEO Jack Emmert said that his studio's "partnership" with NetEase is "coming to an end", and that Jackalyptic's "talented team members will be exploring new opportunities", so it sounds like the studio is shutting down completely.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO on which Jackalyptic Games (formerly Jackalope Games) was reportedly working was never officially revealed, but it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported back in February</a> that the studio was seeking funding for the project following a slew of NetEase studio closures and funding pulls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackalyptic-games-netease-warhammer-mmo-shutdown.jpg?itok=lj7nJz4D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackalyptic-games-netease-warhammer-mmo-shutdown.jpg?itok=vTTCLAgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jackalyptic's purported&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO almost certainly won't be happening now.</figcaption></figure><p>Ben Dahl, who was working with Jackalyptic as one of the studio's sound designers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bendahlmusic_i-suppose-the-news-is-out-with-netease-stepping-activity-7392709898251268096-cS1B/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the company's shutdown, saying that NetEase is "stepping back from their involvement in Jackalyptic". It sounds like the developer wasn't successful in securing alternative funding for the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>

<p>Jackalyptic Games was founded as Jackalope Games by Jack Emmert in May 2022, at which point it was also revealed that the studio was teaming up with Games Workshop on its first project (thus virtually guaranteeing it was based on&nbsp;<em>Warhammer</em>).</p>

<p>The studio was NetEase's first US-based gaming studio, and it was part of a major expansion into studio acquisition, with major figures like ex-Ubisoft producer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">Sean Crooks</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on" rel="nofollow">Ryutaro Ichimura</a>, and BioWare's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mac-walters-worlds-untold-netease" rel="nofollow">Mac Walters</a> teaming up with NetEase for their own ventures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it would prove to be a short honeymoon. Both Crooks' and Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">studios</a> have been&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shut down</a>&nbsp;in the past twelve months, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by another BioWare veteran, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle development team of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-iron-fist-daredevil.jpg?itok=U-9ey-2- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-iron-fist-daredevil.jpg?itok=x-QLmHNk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' development team wasn't safe from NetEase.</figcaption></figure><p>As far as we know, studios like Ichimura's PinCool and ex-Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease" rel="nofollow">GPTRACK50</a> remain operational with NetEase backing, although it could just be a matter of time before they announce their closures as well.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-exoskeleton</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton-aims-to-boost-your-movement-in-december.1348723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions and exoskeleton maker Dnsys have teamed up to create a&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-themed exoskeleton, and you'll be able to buy one in early December, albeit in a "very limited run".</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is a special&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-branded version of Dnsys' Z1 Pro model, and it'll be released on December 2nd, according to a Dnsys <a href="https://dnsys.ai/blogs/dnsys-and-kojima-productions-launch/death-stranding-2-x-dnsys-inspired-by-the-game-engineered-for-reality" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>

<p>The cost of the unit hasn't been revealed, but the company's X1 Lite exoskeleton costs around $700, and since that's on the bottom end of Dnsys' pricing range, you can probably expect to be paying quite a lot more for the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>Z1 Pro. Pricing will be revealed on release day, Dnsys says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dnsys-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton.jpg?itok=bgUSURcq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dnsys-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton.jpg?itok=NItxKLj1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is getting its own branded exoskeleton.</figcaption></figure><p>To create the new exoskeleton (which is launching ahead of the mass production of the Z1 model proper), Dnsys worked with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>artist Yoji Shinkawa, who's also known for his work on Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Shinkawa says he and Dnsys "designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>", and that the device is "something Sam Porter Bridges himself might wear".</p>

<p>According to Dnsys, the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>Z1 Pro will offer "50% extra power to steps", as well as joint protection through "offload[ing] up to 200% of body weight from the knees". You can also expect extended hiking and vertical climbing ranges.</p>

<p>If you'd like to be in with a chance of winning yourself a&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>exoskeleton, you can take part in the new Share Your Journey campaign, which asks you to tell Dnsys how an exoskeleton would help you in your day-to-day life. You can find details <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>As for <i>Death Stranding 2</i>'s creator Hideo Kojima, he's currently hard at work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">new projects&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>, although it's probably going to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years" rel="nofollow">quite some time indeed</a> before the latter sees the light of day, at least.</p>

<p>Dnsys'&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-themed Z1 Pro exoskeleton launches on December 2nd, and as a reminder, it'll be arriving in very limited quantities. Be sure to sign up to the mailing list via the official website to get the best chance of grabbing yours.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony State of Play Japan Revealed for Later This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-japan-november-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-japan-revealed-for-later-this-week.1348720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a brand new PlayStation State of Play show for this week, and it'll focus on games from Japan and the wider Asia region.</p>

<p>As outlined in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the State of Play show will air tomorrow at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and around 10pm GMT). It'll feature "great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles", according to Sony.</p>

<p>The presentation will be aired in Japanese, but it'll feature full English subtitles, so you'll be able to watch it even if you don't speak the language. You will need to watch on the Western PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PLAYSTATION" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, though, because the Japanese channel's show won't feature subtitles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-state-of-play-japan.jpg?itok=28YjJb5k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-state-of-play-japan.jpg?itok=FZOFXEtH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to see Japan-centric Sony games featured during this week's show.</figcaption></figure><p>The new State of Play will last "more than 40 minutes", Sony says, and it'll be hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, who you might know as the Japanese voice of the&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>series' protagonist Adol Christin, as well as his work on anime like&nbsp;<em>My Hero Academia&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em>.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't revealed what kind of games we can expect to see during the show, but since it's focusing on the studio's Asian development efforts, don't hold your breath for updates on titles like&nbsp;<em>Saros&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, games like Arc System Works' upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, as well as Hero Project efforts like&nbsp;<em>Exiledge&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-to-invest-in-china-hero-project-convallaria-to-shore-up-efforts-in-china" rel="nofollow"><em>Convallaria</em></a>, are more likely. I'd imagine we'll see a few new titles announced during the show as well.</p>

<p>News of the new State of Play comes after Sony reaffirmed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">commitment to its live-service agenda</a> back in August, despite the high-profile failure of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delay to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>.</p>

<p>The State of Play Japan presentation for November 2025 airs tomorrow at 2pm Pacific/5pm Eastern/10pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Last week, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-funko-pops-astarion-shadowheart-karlach-1851676142">Funko Pop company</a> hit investors with a dramatic disclosure. “There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months,” it revealed in its latest quarterly <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001704711/83187cc3-3ab8-4098-bc5f-cb16ca0775c6.pdf">earnings report</a>. This is the company warning that it’s at increasing risk of defaulting on its loans. How much is that? Roughly $241 million. I don’t think the banks will accept payment in the form of <em>One Piece</em> Funko Pops.</p>

 <p>The company revealed that it amended its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank back in July in an effort to waive certain requirements and buy time in order to refinance its debt under more manageable terms. That sounds reasonable and the company is certainly spinning this situation as business as usual, but it’s also saying, in no uncertain terms, that there’s a decent chance it won’t be able to pay out everyone it owes by the end of the next 12 months unless something big changes.</p>

 <p>“I want to reiterate the sense of urgency and opportunity around our Make Culture Pop strategy, executing across the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce,” Josh Simon, who just joined as CEO in September after five years at Netflix, said during <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-funko-beats-eps-forecast-stock-dips-in-q3-2025-93CH-4340543">the latest earnings call</a>. “In the short term, I’m looking to maintain the momentum [the chief financial officer] discussed.”</p>

  <p>He continued, “Over the long term, what’s most exciting to me, and I hope is equally exciting to our investors, are the multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth. We have a strategic advantage from building this company over the last 27 years, and we intend to leverage that legacy and relationship with our community of fans to take advantage of the huge opportunity in the increasingly global world of entertainment and pop culture fandom.”</p>

 <p>Who doesn’t love “multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth”?</p> <p>But the numbers are bad. Funko Pop lost $1 million last quarter, a harsh drop from the over $8 million in profit it made a year ago. Why is <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-funko-pop-willy-wonka-golden-ticket-holy-grail-1850683490">the collectible company</a> tumbling off a cliff? You might think it has something to do with losing certain big licenses to competitors or flooding the market with way more junk than even the most die-hard fans are willing to absorb, but the biggest kiss of death came back in the spring in the form of President Trump’s trade war. Tariffs hit sales of cheap toys manufactured overseas hard.</p>

 <h2>Funko mystery boxes to the rescue</h2> <p>The company claims that’s all in the past, however, and the new CEO is touting a big anticipated boost from the upcoming releases of <em>Stranger Things</em>‘ final season&nbsp;and <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. He was also very proud of Funko’s recent Dodgers Championship Five Pack, which he attributed to the company’s new “quick strike” team that can essentially take any major pop culture event in the world and merchandize it at warp speed.</p>

 <p>By far my favorite secret Funko strategy to not go bankrupt is its new Bitty line of mini-figures. That’s right. The company’s brilliant maneuver in its time of distress is just making Funkos smaller and combining them with loot boxes. “We are also planning new innovative retail experiences, such as selling Bitty Pop products through vending machines with a surprise or mystery element to the purchase experience,” the executive team said during the call last week. Inspired!</p> <p>Will Funko still be around in five years? Will it be be acquired by another toy company or chopped up for parts in a private equity buyout? It’s hard to day. One thing’s for certain, though: the plastic faces it has littered across shelves <a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-spider-man-harry-potter-post-malone-pokemon-1850178280">and landfills</a> will remain with us for decades if not centuries to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, it wasn’t just League of Legends that enjoyed a masterful tournament final. Honor of King’s biggest event, the King Pro League, enjoyed a grand final stage that broke records and made history. In China, an astonishing 62,196 esports fans descended upon the National Stadium, surpassing the esports spectator record set in 2016 by <strong>almost 20,000</strong> people.</p>



<p>The record of around 45,000 spectators was previously secured by PES 2016 UEFA Euro, an event held in Paris. Honor of Kings has decimated that record, and even ahead of the event taking place, there were signs that it would do just that.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-king-pro-league-smashes-records">The King Pro League Smashes Records</h2>



<p>Honor of Kings now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest live audience ever in attendance at an esports match. In the grand final of the recent King Pro League in China, 61,196 fans watched the action unfold, proving unequivocally that mobile esports is extremely powerful.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This triumph is important for a few reasons.</p>



<p>Firstly, it’s proving that the accessibility and diversity of mobile games are drawing in a stunning audience. Honor of Kings boasts 260 <strong>million </strong>monthly users, playing across a network that covers 200+ countries. It’s a massively popular game in China, which is where the majority of the game’s market resides.</p>



<p>That’s an indicator of how it was so successful at China’s National Stadium.</p>



<p>Further, mobile gaming is coming up and becoming a more international concept. It has done drastically well in Asian markets but is quickly expanding across LATAM and Africa. While Europe and North America are typically focused more on PC-based esports titles, it’s only a matter of time before the mobile boom hits those regions too.</p>



<p>This redefinition of esports spectatorship has set a new bar for mobile esports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans are rejecting a new description found within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> that describes Link and Princess Zelda as just friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An in-game journal entry from Zelda's ally Lenalia claims that the princesses' sword training was inspired by "a knight — and friend — from her own time." But while this description seems clear-cut, fans have compared it to the text found in the game's original Japanese language version — which simply refers to Link as a "familiar knight," without the explicit "friend" label.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest snippet has reignited the debate over whether Link and Zelda are more than just pals — something that Nintendo itself has kept mysterious for decades. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Lenalia's journal entry is just that — one character's recording of what she has been told by Zelda, who may or may not have been speaking truthfully. In one social media post that has now gone viral, Zelda fan <a href="https://twitter.com/IvyfulWorld/status/1986495137711849817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986495137711849817%7Ctwgr%5E313698543142c4c7282ba9eb9eebd09b2cea6a76%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FIvyfulWorld%2Fstatus%2F1986495137711849817" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IvyfulWorld</a> put it thus: "she is not fooling ANYBODY."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I guess one explanation could be she tried to downplay it out of shyness," replied <a href="https://twitter.com/big_asutaro/status/1986988454962409538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986988454962409538%7Ctwgr%5E5884557b5d53e5338008f836720dbc15021f8e96%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda%2Fzelda-and-link-shippers-are-in-shambles-after-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-describes-them-as-just-friends-but-after-39-years-we-can-read-between-the-lines%2F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big_asutaro</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo of America's localization team has this thing for wanting to portray Link and Zelda's relationship as purely platonic by adding things that aren't even present in the original text," claimed another fan, <a href="https://twitter.com/verieas/status/1986872165581324414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986988454962409538%7Ctwgr%5E5884557b5d53e5338008f836720dbc15021f8e96%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda%2Fzelda-and-link-shippers-are-in-shambles-after-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-describes-them-as-just-friends-but-after-39-years-we-can-read-between-the-lines%2F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verieas</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“and friend” she is not fooling ANYBODY <a href="https://t.co/IwULR3vRhd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IwULR3vRhd</a></p>— Ivy | Sacred Stones (@IvyfulWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/IvyfulWorld/status/1986495137711849817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout its almost 40-year history, The Legend of Zelda series has frequently suggested that Link and the princess are romantically involved. The pair hold hands in the finale of Spirit Tracks, and are implied to be settling down as a couple to found Hyrule at the end of Skyward Sword. Zelda even kisses Link (on the cheek) during Oracle of Ages, sending hearts fluttering from the swordsman's eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most recently, both Zelda and Link appear to be sharing a house in Tears of the Kingdom — which features the incarnations of Link and Zelda referenced in Age of Imprisonment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda voice actress Patricia Summersett, who has voiced the same incarnation of Zelda seen from Breath of the Wild onwards, raised eyebrows in 2023 when she stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship">she believed the pair were definitively "in a relationship</a>." However, Summersett swiftly walked back the comments just days later saying her words had been "misconstrued." (Nintendo did not comment on this kerfuffle at the time, though fans noted it had been unusual for anyone outside the company itself to discuss its characters in such a manner.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what has Nintendo itself said? Perhaps the clearest indicator of Link and Zelda's relationship status came from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-nintendo-eiji-aonuma-hidemaro-fujibayashi">series' legendary producer Eiji Aonuma, who told IGN the following in December 2023</a> when asked for an official ruling on the subject:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I will leave it to everyone's imagination [whether Link and Zelda are in a relationship]. I don't think that Zelda is a type of game where the development team says, 'This is what Zelda is, this is what the story is, this is what the game is.' Everything that the development team wants to convey has already been placed into the game. And the rest is up to the player's imagination, and their reflection on how they feel… what they've experienced in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering the most recent Zelda game features a house lived in by Link and Zelda (with Nintendo placing just a single bed into the bedroom), some fans took Aonuma's comment to be the clearest sign yet that Nintendo does indeed see the two as a couple — even if it doesn't want to explicitly apply that label in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo handles the two characters in its upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda live-action movie</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-shooting-in-new-zealand">which recently began shooting in New Zealand</a> following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-actors-set-to-play-link-and-zelda-in-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-film">casting of its two key roles earlier this year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">crossover event with The Simpsons</a>--which includes multiple Simpsons-themed skins and a new map inspired by Springfield--is one of the game's most successful events ever, with over three million concurrent players logging in over the weekend. A new short, uploaded today on the official Fortnite YouTube channel, shows how Epic Games will up the ante in tomorrow's update--if you plan to log in, keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awAmdYB6Xuc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the skis...er, skies</a>.</p><p>The short features Homer and Professor Frink speaking about the shard Homer has installed into his TV remote. Frink wants to analyze it, but Homer isn't through using it, as he immediately transforms a nearby round cloud into a massive donut, which falls from the sky. Homer then transforms Frink into a new version of Peely dressed as the professor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaYY9ghy8EQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GaYY9ghy8EQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video then shifts to gameplay footage, which showcases massive donuts falling from the sky all over the Springfield map. We also get new glimpses of some upcoming skins: Lisa Simpson, who is riding in a mech like her brother Bart; Moe Szyslak, the grumpy bartender; and Peely dressed as Professor Frink from the animated short, which seems to be the second skin available in the Springfielder Peely portion of the current battle pass.</p><p>Finally, the trailer shifts back to another animated scene, with the aftermath of Homer's antics in full view. The town is complaining to Mayor Quimby about the food raining from the sky, and the town agrees to put a stop to it. Meanwhile, Homer disposes of the shard by throwing it into nuclear waste, then falls into the waste himself--only for multiple Homers to appear, seemingly teasing the next major change coming to the Fortnite Simpsons event.</p><p>Fortnite is free to download and play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, and mobile devices. The current Simpsons-themed season is scheduled to run until November 29.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We may be about to see a whole new product line of Valve-made gaming hardware. Speculation suggests Valve has a new Steam Controller, virtual reality headset, and console-like device in development, and they may be revealed as soon as this week.</p>
<p>The speculation seems to originate from trusted leaker Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley), who stoked the fires overnight by sharing <a href="https://xcancel.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813">an AI-generated mock-up of what he says the new Steam Controller will look like</a>. Notably, the haptic thumbpads have moved towards the bottom of the controller whereas they used to be towards the top. Lynch claims there's full finger-tracking in the grips, and that the controller can detect how far away your hands are from the handles.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p><p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p><p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"Yes. It's an AI slop photo," wrote Lynch on X. "Trained on a real image of the new controller. It was just fast and easy to do it this way. I was not going to post the original one just in case it reveals any sensitive info from the source."</p><p>It's also Lynch who suggested a reveal date of 12th November, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveDeckard/comments/1oqwwla/steam_framedeckard_everything_we_know_so_far/">a coherent round-up of Valve hardware rumours on Reddit</a>. As you can see from that post, the bulk of the other patent-related rumours revolve around a new VR headset, which is believed to be codenamed Deckard - although it's also sometimes referred to as Steam Frame. That name - Steam Frame - may also refer to a new operating system developed for the device. The information suggests we're about to see another high-end VR headset priced at around the $1200 mark, possibly more.</p>
<p>The console rumours, meanwhile, revolve around something codenamed Valve Fremont, a games-capable box that features custom AMD processors and a Radeon graphics card. Again, the rumours originate from <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1957931577444561350">Brad Lynch, who highlighted the device's appearance on cross-platform benchmarking site Geekbench</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Valve has made considerable in-roads into the enthusiast-level games hardware space with the HTC Vive, a VR headset, and the more recent handheld device, Steam Deck. The attraction of a console-like device built to take advantage of Steam's enormous gaming catalogue will be strong indeed. I wonder, if it's true, how much it will cost.</p>

This is the most affordable entry point into Roborock’s premium robot vacuum lineup and it <strong>still includes the self-emptying docking station</strong> that higher-end models boast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Premium Features at an Entry-Level Price</h2>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction power</strong> puts this vacuum in serious performance territory, generating enough force to pull embedded pet hair from carpet fibers and lift stubborn debris from hard floors in a single pass. That suction strength matters greatly when you have to deal with the fine dust that settles into textured surfaces or the heavier particles that accumulate along baseboards and in corners. The<strong> edge-cleaning design</strong> ensures the vacuum captures debris right up to walls and furniture legs, eliminating those frustrating dust lines that cheaper robots leave behind.</p>



<p>The<strong> dual anti-tangle system</strong> solves one of the most frustrating problems with robot vacuums: the constant need to stop and cut hair wrapped around brushes. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> features a design that actively resists hair entanglement, while the side brush boasts a 0% hair-tangling rate even with long-haired pets or family members who shed constantly. This engineering improvement translates into fewer maintenance interruptions and more consistent cleaning performance. You can go several weeks without having to flip the robot over and go through the annoying process of cutting hair free from brush rollers.</p>



<p>Th<strong>e RockDock Plus self-emptying station elevates this vacuum from a good deal to an exceptional one</strong>. With a 2.7-liter sealed dust bag that holds up to seven weeks of dirt, pet hair, and other debris, you empty the system roughly twice a quarter, not after every cleaning session. The sealed bag does not allow dust to escape when finally needing to replace the bag so allergy sufferers are protected from the collected allergens being reintroduced into the air.</p>
<p>The integrated vacuum and mopping function covers the complete floor cleaning equation in one device: After it vacuums up dry debris, <strong>the mop functionality follows through with the ability to take on stuck-on spills and paw prints</strong>. Three adjustable water flow settings let you adjust the amount of moisture based on your floor type and just how dirty they’ve gotten-from light dampening during daily maintenance to heavier flow for deeper cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>LiDAR navigation accurately maps your home which is a far cry from what can be achieved with budget robots relying on simple bump sensors. The laser-based mapping creates a detailed floor plan that the robot then uses to calculate the most efficient cleaning path, covering every accessible area without redundant passes or missed spots. Real-time mapping updates when the robot discovers new obstacles or you have rearranged furniture, thus adapting to the changes in your home layout automatically.</p>
<p>For $219, this Roborock Q7 Max+ brings flagship features to midrange pricing and opens premium automated cleaning to households that may otherwise find these systems too expensive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase, spotlighting upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pc-cross-buy-leak-sony-handheld-ps6-2000641324"><span>PlayStation 5 games</span></a><span>. However, this one will be a little bit different when it premieres tomorrow, as it will specifically highlight games from Japanese developers, and thus will only be streamed in Japanese with English subtitles.</span></p>

 <p><span>The State of Play Japan stream will take place tomorrow, November 11, at 2 p.m. PT /&nbsp; 5 p.m. ET /&nbsp; 11 p.m. CEST, and will be hosted by Japanese voice actor Yuki Kaji, known for his roles in the </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>series overseas. According to a post on the </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/"><span>PlayStation Blog</span></a><span>, the 40-minute show will focus on games from developers in Japan, as well as Asian studios more broadly, and will have a spread of both “beloved series” and independent projects. Sometimes, when companies put on streams like a State of Play or a Nintendo Direct, Japan will get a different version than the one we see in English-speaking territories, but it sounds like this show will be the same across Japanese and English streams. The show will be featured on PlayStation’s YouTube channel.</span></p>

 <p><span>The blog doesn’t get into any specifics about what games will be shown, but Kaji hosting does make me wonder if we might hear more about the next </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> game. </span><i><span>Ys X: Proud Nordics</span></i><span>, an enhanced port of the original </span><i><span>Ys X</span></i><span>, was released earlier this year on Switch 2, so perhaps it might come to the PS5 when it launches in English next year. Or maybe a new </span><i><span>Ys </span></i><span>could be on its way? But that’s just me speculating.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, based on the show’s premise, we might not hear much from PlayStation’s internal studios because most of its first-party dev teams are based outside of Japan these days ever since Sony shuttered Japan Studio. Team Asobi operates out of Tokyo, but given that it just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a><span> last year, it’s probably too early for that team to deliver anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam could be getting ready to reveal the first details of its new VR headset. According to known Valve insider Brad Lynch, the company could be ready to announce its new device, expected to be called the Steam Frame, sometime this week.</p>



<p>He’s even been told a specific day to keep an eye on.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m just going to flat out say it,”</strong> Lynch said in his Discord. <strong>“I was told by a few sources, across a few weeks, to keep an eye out for this week. More specifically on Wednesday.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that it <strong>“doesn’t seem to be out of the question”</strong> for Valve to announce the device. Lynch says that he feels the company will <strong>“need a week or two to explain the device to people before opening orders anyway.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment on these claims.</p>



<p>Rumors and reports about the new Steam VR headset have been out for months. Earlier this year, it was claimed that the plan was for Valve to release the headset <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-vr-headset-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of 2025</a> with a price of $1,200. In September, the likely name for the device was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered via a trademark filing</a> and datamining. Finally, in early October, it was reported that the Steam Frame had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a> with initial production plans to call for 400,000-600,000 units. </p>



<p>Of the mass production claims, Lynch said that the SteamVR Beta included Deckard, the device’s codename, DV1 and DV2 models. He said that <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>The Steam Frame is expected to launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers for the device as well. But that’s not all. Steam is reportedly working on a new Steam Controller 2 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new SteamOS console</a> of some sort.</p>

			<p>Sony has announced a new type of State of Play event, which will premiere tomorrow, on November 11, 2025. It's called a 'State of Play Japan,' and is set to specifically feature games coming to PlayStation made by developers in Japan and across Asia. </p>



<p>The event will be 40 minutes long and kick off at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CET, and according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that revealed the event, it'll feature "<em>beloved series to distinctive indie creations</em>," and be hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, who players might recognize from their work on several anime series including Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, and their work in several video game series including Final Fantasy, Ys, and Fire Emblem.</p>

<p>As it is a live stream event focused on games from Japan and across Asia, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStationJapan">PlayStation Japan YouTube channel</a> will feature a full Japanese-speaking live stream. If you want to follow along but don't speak Japanese, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation/featured">watch a version with English subtitles on the main PlayStation YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike previous State of Play events, there hasn't been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">a long, stretched-out rumor cycle</a> leaking the event and what will be shown, so most of what we see tomorrow will be a surprise. That said, there are definitely a few games that come to mind that we could see tomorrow.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">is out on PS5 and PC later this week</a>, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see it appear at this event as a final marketing push. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls from Arc System Work</a>s is another game that could very likely be shown off here, as we've seen a couple of gameplay trailers by now, and it was playable at EVO 2025. We might finally get a proper release date for it at tomorrow's event, even if it might not arrive in 2025.</p>



<p>And if it doesn't arrive in 2025, then that might also be because it'll arrive alongside PlayStation's new fighting stick accessory, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike, which is due out in 2026</a>. It's a good bet that whenever Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is ready to release, the FlexStrike will not be far behind, if it isn't already out, or even launching on the same day.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego%E2%80%99s-statue-of-liberty-1-635-piece-set-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-sells-tons-at-this-record-low-price.1348606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Few ideals are more powerful to the collective of humanity than freedom and there are few symbols more representative of that concept than Lady Liberty standing tall in New York Harbor. <strong>LEGO Architecture Statue of Liberty Set #21042</strong> brings this iconic monument into your home, pieced together from an astounding 1,635 pieces, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5416/">and now is available for only $80 on Amazon, down from its regular $119 price</a>. This is the lowest price this set has ever reached and for this reason alone, it’s a great opportunity to own a piece of American history in buildable form.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5416/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>More Than Just a Monument</h2>
<p>The level of detail LEGO packed into this 1,635-piece set goes way beyond what you’d expect from a normal building kit. The <strong>flowing robe features intricate folds and textures that catch the movement of fabric frozen in copper</strong>, while the detailed pedestal includes accurate shield designs, brick detailing patterns, and columned balconies that mirror the real monument’s neoclassical architecture. The seven-ray crown sits atop Liberty’s head, with each ray individually constructed to represent the seven continents and seven seas. The <strong>upraised arm holds the golden torch</strong> that has guided ships into New York Harbor for over a century, and the iconic tablet inscribed with the date of American independence rests in her left hand.</p>



<p>The sand-green and beige color scheme is really special as it authentically represents the patina that developed on the statue’s copper exterior over decades of exposure to the elements. When France gifted the statue to the United States in 1886, it shone bright with the vibrant copper tone of a new penny. The chemical reaction between copper and salt air in the sea slowly worked to transform the surface into the distinctive blue-green hue we recognize today. LEGO replicated this with perfection, and gives the model a historical accuracy that makes it not just a toy but something worth collecting.</p>



<p>The building experience itself provides hours of engaging activity that appeals to both teens and adults. Coming in at 1,635 pieces, this set offers true complexity without becoming overwhelming and strikes that perfect balance where you’re challenged but never frustrated. The construction techniques Lego used to recreate the statue’s curves and architectural details teach valuable lessons about how angles, specialized pieces, and creative stacking can produce organic shapes from rectangular blocks.</p>
<p>When complete, the model becomes a remarkable display piece that draws the eye in any room. <strong>Standing over 17 inches tall including the pedestal</strong>, the finished statue offers visual impact that simply cannot be matched by other, smaller Lego sets. The decorative nameplate included adds a museum-quality touch that frames the model as a serious architectural reproduction rather than a simple toy. The display works equally well on a desk in a home office, on a living room bookshelf, or on a bedroom dresser, starting conversations with visitors who can appreciate the craftsmanship involved.</p>
<p>At $80, this set is a great value considering piece count, display impact, and historical significance. The 33% discount off the standard $119 price represents real savings on a set that will remain desirable long after you are done building it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re getting toward the end of 2025, but there’s still time for one final Sony State of Play showcase in November. The special Japan and Asia edition of the presentation features special looks at upcoming games where development is localized to those areas. </p>



<p>The September edition of State of Play was a biggie. We got an exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine gameplay trailer</a>, new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saros footage</a>, and much more. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was it for Sony’s State of Play events this year. However, PlayStation has one more event in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The State of Play Japan &amp; Asia broadcast takes place on November 11 (or November 12 in Japan), starting at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET / 11 PM CEST, or 7 AM JST.</p>



<p>An official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony blog</a> had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This Tuesday, we’re bringing you a special episode of State of Play running for more than 40 minutes, focusing on games created in Japan and across Asia, alongside a few other exciting updates.</p>



<p>From beloved series to distinctive indie creations, the show, hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, will be packed with great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, it will be 40 minutes long—so it’s not short!</p>

                <p>Celebrated video game composer Mick Gordon has revealed that he is working on his first full video game soundtrack in five years, for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">upcoming FPS game Defect</a>. The cyberpunk-themed asymmetric shooter will see Gordon bring his skills to the game, and for this project, he's aiming to push the music to the very edge of what's possible using his signature talent for heavy sounds and distortion.</p><p>"It's celebrating that deformity, almost like some form of rebellion," Gordon said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/mick-gordon-is-asking-how-heavy-can-we-get-it-in-his-first-full-game-soundtrack-since-doom-eternal-im-really-exploring-the-extremes-of-distortion-with-this-project/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "I'm always trying to push it, always trying to push it more. Like, how heavy can we get it? I'm really exploring the extremes of distortion with this project. How distorted can you get it, where you lose the musicality, and then bring it back."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr-kLx-ZPhM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wr-kLx-ZPhM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gordon added that he'll make use of synthesizer sounds traditionally associated with the cyberpunk genre, and he has a few ideas of how to put his own spin on those instruments. "Setting that background theme against this dystopian cyberpunk world gave me all sorts of ideas, especially with regards to synthesizers, and how synths should resemble analog machinery in a way," Gordon said. "Something that's palpable and tangible, and it must be alive within the sort of grimness of the cityscapes that this game takes place in."</p><p>One surprising influence for Defect's soundtrack comes straight out of the 1990 live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, with Gordon remarking how one scene in particular featured a track during the <a href="https://youtu.be/CDJev_Sw-j8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Foot Clan recruitment drive</a> that caught his eye--or ear, to be more precise. While Defect marks the first full soundtrack that Gordon will be working on since Doom Eternal--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-composer-distances-himself-from-the-n/1100-6476272/">a project that ended Gordon's collaboration with developer Id Software</a> after a <a href="https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce" rel="nofollow ">dramatic falling out</a>--he hasn't been sitting idly by.</p><p>Gordon helped compose a large chunk of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-crispy-critters/1900-6418033/" data-ref-id="1900-6418033">Atomic Heart</a> soundtrack and contributed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/absolum-review-a-sleeper-hit/1900-6418419/" data-ref-id="1900-6418419">Absolum</a>, DotEmu's new fantasy-themed beat-'em-up that recently launched. Between those games, Gordon also did "production role stuff" with several metal bands.</p>
