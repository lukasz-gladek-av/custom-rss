<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158402/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Regarding modern augmentations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> — released not even a month apart — have a lot of overlap. Yet, after 45 minutes of play, I was convinced that Art of Vengeance is one of the finest 2D Ninja action games ever made. Perhaps <em>the finest;</em> and such praise doesn’t come lightly.</p>
<p>After Ragebound’s dazzle, I was unsure if Shinobi could top it; yet it has. Visually beautiful, broadly artistic, and almost calligraphic in nature, the styling is well-married to its Japanese thematic. Natural elements of wood, cloth, and stone fuse with heavy machinery, concrete and military steel, the rural areas reflecting the painted landscapes of Hokusai and Taikan.</p>
<p>Lizardcube’s artists use a softening filter for a brush-like, watercolour flavour, and the grading is exceptional, bringing a picture book of panoramas to life without ever drowning out the foreground sprites. The hazy glow of orange-lantern-lit cities, thundering cornfields, and dense, raining cityscapes are majestic to behold, the camera often drawing out to allow a particular diorama to marinate. Where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>’s multimedia clash was jarring in places, Art of Vengeance nails its aesthetic with pure, curved grace. That said, on Switch 2, the game's resolution isn’t properly optimised, resulting in jaggy upscaling. Something to consider if that’s your primary console.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158399/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The score is provided by the eminent Tee Lopes (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>), and a smattering of additions by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro. It’s a fitting, occasionally haunting arrangement of traditional Japanese instruments, layered with rhythms to complement the pace of the action. As locales get more industrial, the tempo becomes increasingly dance-oriented.</p>
<p>Joe Musashi, the returning hero, cuts a fine form. Voiceless, and amusingly grunting his way through cutscene exchanges, he moves with fox-like agility and strikes with a rubber band snap. The animation flows with impeccable detail, from that slight spring of the heels to the graceful arc of a backwards evasion.</p>
<p>Joe's a blast to control; sprinting by default, and double-jumping and air-dashing freely. His invulnerable roll is cat-like, passing through dangers to position him for the kill. He can fire off Kunai for ranged attacks, drop kick onto the heads of enemies, and wields light and hard sword strikes that combo with the greatest of ease. Ninja action has literally never looked — or felt — this good.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158397/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet, what really separates Art of Vengeance from the aforementioned Ragebound — despite sharing so many of the same ideas — is its combat implementation. Shinobi doesn’t just give you a nice set of attacks and dodges: it gets <em>deep.</em> The technical opportunities here are so unflappably cool, so tightly engineered, and so seamlessly applied that each new mix-up routine leaves you with a foolish grin.</p>
<p>Unlike past Shinobi games, enemies now have life bars, tying into its new combat approach. Not dissimilar to a fighting game in its core mechanics, Joe is constantly granted new attacks and attack alternatives to try in the field. What it’s careful not to do, however, is blunt ambitions or alienate players with overbearing complexity. You don’t have to employ every trick to get through the game, as basic light and hard attack tandems, the odd Kunai, and whatever super attacks you have at your disposal will serve you well enough. You’re so tooled up by four stages in that the swordplay writes itself most of the time, leaving you to focus on your dodging, the game’s most essential move.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158398/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, if you want to get surgical, it’s ninja heaven. The impressive animation doesn’t interfere, as most of everything is cancellable into the next attack. To get an idea of the game’s motion, you can dash forward, tap 'R' to hop over a box without losing pace, before rolling through an incoming Shuriken. From there you light attack twice, tap 'R' to leap through the enemy, and slap the button again to whirlwind into them, layering the combo meter. Direct Joe to land back centrally, employ two heavy swipes and then leap for a one-two juggle, before shooting three Kunai through the opponent while they're still airborne. By this point the Execution Gauge is full, and slamming both shoulder buttons will send Joe ripping through them anywhere on the screen, releasing a bounty of health icons and gold.</p>
<p>If that sounds sublime, it’s because it darn well is. The devs have also implemented a hard-hitting use of slowdown, providing feedback when a critical hit has landed, or when you’ve taken a blow. And the full-screen super attacks, rumbling in with a falling bass line, are a sight to behold. The game also allows you to return to your training dojo from the World Map screen at any time, where you can hone new techniques and acquired skills.</p>
<p>There are some absolutes, however, that can't be ignored. For example, the charge fist, acquired early on, is required to punch through shielded enemies and inaccessible green barricades. The bosses, too, an impressive assortment of demons, machines, and guardians, are pattern-based and won’t submit to spamming. These encounters are thrilling once you get them down, compelling you to exploit your dashes, dodges, and supers in experimental ways. Art of Vengeance can be challenging, and although not quite on the level of some of Ragebound’s encounters, you are expected to be nimble, especially when navigating moving platforms or threading yourself through deadly obstacles.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158401/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those concerned that the game was <em>another</em> Metroidvania can breathe easy, as it’s a largely linear affair. From the World Map screen you can see percentages of completion, and backtracking is optional. There are five hidden orbs on each stage, and three areas where you can enter “Elite Squad” skirmishes: single-screen crowd battles to test the reflexes. Hidden orbs open up new skill options in the shops that, once purchased, can be applied through your gear menu. Here, you can customise Joe with your preferred attacks, upgrade Kunai to perform different functions, and even refashion the way the combo meter rewards you. It will be interesting to see how skilled players go down different routes with this.</p>
<p>Every checkpoint refills your life and doubles as a new teleportation spot. This means you can return to a stage — and, within that stage, a specific point — at any time. The most Metroid thing about it is that there are certain barricades that can’t be broken until you have a particular skill - but returning to them is neither obfuscated nor tedious, and in many cases either reap a quick reward or help you get closer to 100%. The primary impetus to do this is if you want to upgrade Joe faster, extending his health and super stocks. It's worth noting that even if you play it in a straight line, it's a lengthy campaign that will require around 10 hours to finish.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158403/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Stage layouts are broad but focused, with width for exploration. They run horizontally and vertically, are full of switches to trigger, and are inventively formed, with things to hang on, walls to run up, and air-dash extending portals to keep you in-flight. As per-Shinobi games of the past, Joe moves through the mountains and into more industrial territory, from factory smelting works to neon-draped cities full of fan-service Sega signage.</p>
<p>The action offers variety, too, whether racing on the back of a Yamato, Joe’s faithful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/shadow_dancer_the_secret_of_shinobi">Shadow Dancer</a> canine, or outrunning encroaching walls of flame. There are a few places where you're unsure if going down leads to a death or a new area, and it can occasionally be unclear where to go next - but this is what the map is for, ultimately. Perhaps there could have been more arcade-like variety in places, like the mountain factory’s awesome saw blade chicane, but the maps are well-engineered to exercise Joe’s skillset. Series fans will also note many a callback to the series' Mega Drive entries, with a fair lump sum plucked from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/shinobi_iii_return_of_the_ninja_master">Shinobi III</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158396/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of scoring, if it performed well, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a straight nine. It’s glorious. And that makes its frame rate issues all the more painful. Where Ragebound’s frame rate on Switch was its primary negative, Shinobi is buttery smooth for the most part. But, in certain spots where the camera scales out against busier backgrounds, it seriously suffers.</p>
<p>Initially, these instances are so brief they can be mostly overlooked, but in the Mountain Factory it suddenly becomes prolonged and increasingly severe, causing a jarring, peculiar sprite judder the like I’ve never seen before. We contacted Sega PR to see if this will be addressed in a promised patch, but we've had no response.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In reinventing the retro wheel, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance leads the way: a demonstration of how modern tools, accompanied by thought and talent, can be expanded upon to not just reboot franchises, but actually rebuild them in new and incredible ways. It’s one thing to revisit an arcade action game with new graphics, moves, and weapons, cherry picking familiar set-pieces and nostalgic visuals; it’s another entirely to create a new experience, utilising craftsmanship and a belief that the hardware can offer more.</p>
<p>Art of Vengeance, its cadence and flow, its violence and exhilaration — and the fact it makes you feel like an absolute badass from one slain enemy to the next — is a trendsetter. Fix that frame rate, and it’s pure ninja gold.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It feels like just yesterday that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>was only on my radar because the internet was memeing the hell out of one of the musical’s early scenes in which Huntr/x, the fictional girl group that would give Dante from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417"><i><span>Devil May Cry</span></i></a> <span>a run for his money on the demon-slaying front, devours their pre-show snacks in a way that can only be described as bestial. If I had listened to the dismissive jokes, I might have thought the movie was just some goofy animated slop in Netflix’s never-ending content mill and passed on loading it up to see what all the fuss was about. However, even if I hadn’t taken the plunge, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>would have become a phenomenon too big to ignore. In the two months since the movie launched on Netflix’s streaming service, the movie Sony was too cautious to release in theaters on its own has become arguably one of the most important moments in pop culture this year. How did we get here? What can we learn from the movie’s resounding success? Given how well the first movie has performed for Netflix, is there any need for the inevitable sequel to do anything differently?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success can be attributed to a few factors, but all of it leads back to it having every advantage in a world where it’s increasingly imperative that a project achieve viral recognition and good word of mouth. Launching on Netflix was undeniably a boon for the film, as kids love to watch movies on repeat, and if an audience readily has easier access to something at home, it feeds The Content Machine. YouTubers can create entire reaction videos from the comfort of their own homes, clips that aren’t just grainy camera recordings in a dark theater can circulate on social media, and its soundtrack of catchy K-pop earworms can be available on streaming the day the movie comes out. Even if its title and premise didn’t grab your attention, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was uniquely positioned to find its audience, and that audience is historically very loud.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000618423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618423"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618423">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The K-pop audience is merely one slice of the pie, however. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ stunning </span><i><span>Spider-Verse</span></i><span>-esque animation, anime-inspired action, and Disney-like musicality means that even if the core premise doesn’t appeal to you, the movie probably has something that will catch your eye. As specific as its audience appears on the surface, the film isn’t just gunning for the biggest Twice stan with a Netflix subscription. Casual K-Pop listeners like myself found a lot to love in the film’s story of self-acceptance punctuated by some absolute bangers. The end result is something that transcends K-pop fandom and has rooted itself in the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is a chart-topping success story on multiple fronts. It’s now Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-watched film of all time</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/KPop-Demon-Hunters-(2025)#tab=summary"><span>topped the box office</span></a><span> with limited </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>singalong screenings</span></a><span> that the AMC theater chain </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kpop-demon-hunters-gives-netflix-first-box-office-win-rcna226872"><span>didn’t even participate in</span></a><span> its self-love anthem, “Golden,” has </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/huntrx-golden-global-charts-number-one-sixth-week-1236051236/"><span>been at the top of the Billboard top 200 for weeks</span></a><span>; and the movie’s soundtrack is the first to have </span><a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-charts-golden-lyrics-singalong-b2813992.html"><span>four songs in Billboard’s top 10 at once</span></a><span>. All of this success with a movie for which Sony made the “safe” choice to have Netflix foot the production bill in exchange for </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kpop-demon-hunters-sony-netflix-sequel-talks-1236353972/"><span>exclusive streaming rights</span></a><span> and a split revenue in soundtrack sales. While some, myself included, have called Sony’s decision foolish, given the movie has done nothing but thrive since it arrived on Netflix, there is part of me that wonders if Huntr/x would have become a household name were </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>not so easily accessible. So much of its spread has been because it is easily clippable, screenshotable, and shareable across social media like TikTok and YouTube. Sony’s hesitation to put the movie in theaters may have been what led to it becoming the viral hit it has.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620410"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620410">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But what is the source of that hesitation? Is it because someone up top thought K-pop was too niche, or the mix of genres was too off-putting? Or is it just that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was a new property led by women? The film</span> <span>is the latest example of women-led cinema doing huge numbers, and then the rest of the world acting surprised that something ostensibly targeting young girls has an audience. The </span><i><span>Barbie </span></i><span>movie made over a billion dollars, the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>movies are some of the most successful animated films of all time, and we still need astronomical success stories to convince us that there’s demand for women-led films. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is breaking through multiple ceilings both for its own success and to pave the way for others, but only time will tell if anyone actually learns anything from this, or if the film industry’s goldfish brain kicks in again and we forget until the sequel rolls out in a few years.</span></p>

              <p>Just ten years back, it’d be tough to imagine Disney being willing to put its name to something as outstandingly gory as <em>Marvel: Rivals</em>. The new trailer reveals some incredibly gloopy deaths, outlandish violence, and blood absolutely everywhere. It’s surely one of the goriest things Disney has ever made? The show will also feature the voices of big-time Hollywood names like Paul Rudd, Florence Pugh, Elizabeth Olsen and Awkwafina.</p> <p>It’s Disney’s rush of acquisitions that mostly seems to have contributed to the once prim company now releasing some very adult content. Buying Marvel and Fox meant the not so family-friendly <em>X-Men</em> movies arrived on streaming platform Disney+, and the two combined in spectacular fashion in the&nbsp;<em>Deadpool</em> movies. It’s quite something that such films appear alongside the gallery of princesses on the subscription service. Now add <em>Marvel Zombies</em> to that discombobulation, because damn, this trailer has all the gore.</p>  <p>I had no expectations for this. The&nbsp;<em>What If…</em> series has mostly left me very flat, but <em>What If… Zombies?!</em> has inspired a whole new miniseries, due to be added to the streamer September 24, and this trailer has me absolutely in.</p>

 <p>It helps that the voice cast is absolutely incredible. <em>What If…</em> occasionally got the movie actors, but often not–this time, though, it’s a stunning collection. As you’ll hear in the trailer there’s Florence Pugh revising her <em>Thunderbolts*</em> role as Yelena Belova, along with David Harbour as her father, Alexei Shostakov. But there’s also Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Awkwafina as Xu Shang-Chi’s bestie Katy, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch (naturally a zombie), Wyatt Russell as the unimprovably named John Walker, Tessa Thompson as <em>Thor</em>‘s Valkyrie, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan. And that’s barely half the list.</p> <p>The whole thing is obviously entirely non-canon for the MCU, rather offering a chance to let the characters behave in ways they otherwise never could, in circumstances that Disney would <em>never</em> let reach the big screen. Or would they? I mean,&nbsp;<em>Deadpool</em> got to keep going! Maybe one day.</p> <p>The trailer’s highlight for me? Definitely Spider-Man (still voiced by Hudson Thames as in previous animated series) taking the heads of so many zombs at once. Very not Peter Parker-like behavior.</p>

<p>Activision has announced that all players of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone will receive 20 Battle Pass Tier skips. The move comes as a thank you to players as updates for the game wind down ahead of the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>In order to get your free Battle Pass Tier skips, players simply have to login to either Black Ops 6 or Warzone between now and September 16. Once you do, they will automatically be added to your account.</p>



<p>Activision says that the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update will <strong>“be larger on some platforms”</strong> due to <strong>“reorganizing&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;content to prepare for the&nbsp;Black Ops 7&nbsp;Beta on October 2.”</strong> Because of the size of the update, Activision will be giving players a number of double XP tokens on all platforms.</p>



<p>Those who download the update and login to the game between September 4 and October 1 will get <strong>five 1-hour double player XP tokens</strong>, <strong>five 1-hour double weapon XP tokens</strong>, and <strong>five 1-hour double Battle Pass XP tokens</strong>. That equates to 15 hours of double XP in order to unlock and level up what you’re still grinding for. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded launches on September 5. The update includes a new multiplayer map, more Zombies content, new and returning modes, and more. Full details for the update can be found on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-season-05-reloaded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty website</a>.</p>

"We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for the default settings and default users."</p><p dir="ltr">The decision to not include ray tracing was made "early on" Buhl said. In a separate interview, Buhl may have revealed why ray tracing wasn't a priority for the team, stating that a "meaningful percentage" of players during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/many-battlefield-6-fans-played-beta-using-minimum-specs-says-ea/1100-6534385/" data-ref-id="1100-6534385">Battlefield 6 beta were using minimum recommended specs</a> or below.</p><p dir="ltr">"Min spec is certainly one of our most important specs," Bruhl said. "It's super important from both a commercial and business perspective--we want as many people as possible playing the game."</p><p dir="ltr">An emphasis on ray-tracing would definitely go against that philosophy of looking to ensure the game plays well on as wide a range of PCs as possible.

<p>We were pleasantly surprised to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> make an appearance make an appearance in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Direct</a>, and as we close in on its <strong>26th September</strong> release date, Bandai Namco has some fresh gameplay footage for us so we can see how it's shaping up.</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer (above) gives us our closest look yet at the upcoming remake, with Pac-Man himself walking us through all the new additions. This includes a breakdown of his new moveset, the assist Fairy Mode and challenge Time Trial Mode, and the Pac-Village minigames.</p>
<p>The newbies are all well and good, but we're enjoying simply seeing more gameplay from the damn thing. Bandai Namco released a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-is-a-big-glow-up-on-switch-and-switch-2">side-by-side comparison</a> of the 2002 original and the remake shortly after the game was announced, and it seems to be an almighty upgrade as far as visuals are concerned.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we thought that the last Re-Pac release was perfectly solid slice of PS1 platforming, even if it did play things a little too safe. Here's hoping that the sequel can muster up something a little more imaginative.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s latest patch is following up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing">addition of fishing</a> in the only way that's natural. Bethesda have opted to revamp its base building mechanics in an effort to make thing easier for newbies and offer veterans some extra freedom to stick huge shacks full of stuff together in different ways.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4xj9qqfxl7bKHnRVkXKPKm/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-release-notes">Patch 62</a>, dubbed 'C.A.M.P revamp', menus have been rejigged and placement restrictions relaxed in an effort to have you spend 60 more hours slapping bits of wood into accomodation, rather than going off and ruining some super mutant's day. Then again, I can't imagine the green folks are too happy about the wasteland being turned into a showroom of properties that'd probably cost several million quid despite the fact they can barely keep the radiation out, such are modern house prices.</p>

<p>The aspect of the patch - which drops today, September 2nd - that's most caught my eye is the restriction loosening that the devs say will allow players to stick a number of items anywhere, "even in the air". While this doesn't apply to everything, with some stuff still demanding you set it down on the ground, the patch's trailer shows off a number of houses built atop rocky outcrops that'd usually turn everything red outside of modded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p><p>To paraphrase a British TV show, when it comes to houses it's the whereabouts, whereabouts, whereabouts that can be key, and this looks to be making killer views much more accessible. Is it wise to build your house up high and out in the open if there are nukes flying around? Probably not, but hey, video game.</p>
<p>In line with that general restriction loosening, the need to snap home components directly together has also been relaxed. "Walls can also be built beneath the floor, and upper floors can be attached to walls without the need for a staircase," Bethesda say. Yep, just get rid of your stairs and use a power armour jetpack to get upstairs. I'm sure that'll end well if your fusion core runs dry and you're bursting for the loo. Actually, I'm forgetting, this is a video game house. The very swanky and totally unnecessary downstairs commode was the second thing you built.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the building menu revamp, which aims to make it easier to find the thing you're looking for without as much rummaging through interface drawers. "We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights." There's a quote you'd just as likely find in an email from your flat-pack furniture retailer of choice.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Bethesda's got a bunch of community building competitions planned for the rest of the year, with the first set to run from the revamp's release to September 29th. Good luck beating out the loose collection of floor-walls with random clutter slapped onto it that I might submit.</p>

              <p>Last year, Sony released a new PS5 Dualsense controller themed around the then-upcoming platformer <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Astro Bot</a>.</em> The game was a huge hit with critics and fans, as was the controller, which sold out quickly and became hard to find. But now, a slightly tweaked version of the popular gamepad is returning in October with pre-orders later this month.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092">On September 2</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-five-new-free-levels-july-10-cameo-bots-ps5-1851786014">after some teasing in July,</a> PlayStation revealed that the new “Joyful” version of the<em> Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller was officially launching just before Halloween, on October 30. And gamers who missed out on buying an <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> controller last year will have a chance to pre-order the new version on September 12 at 10 a.m. local time via PlayStation’s own online store and “participating retailers.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Astro Bot returns with a new delightful twist! </p> <p>The limited edition Astro Bot Joyful DualSense launches October 30. Pre-orders start September 12 at 10am local time at <a href="https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG">https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG</a> and participating retailers. <a href="https://t.co/TLqJEyEZSt">pic.twitter.com/TLqJEyEZSt</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This isn’t the same controller that was sold back in 2024 and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controllers-are-being-scalped-for-over-150-second-hand-market-exclusive-items/">quickly gobbled up and scalped on eBay</a> for more than twice the price. Well, it’s mostly the same controller. The only real difference is the touchpad. On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">OG <em>Astro Bot</em> gamepad</a>, the eyes were open and always watching you play. This time around, the eyes are slightly closed, simulating joy and happiness. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-edition-dualsense-astro-bot-pre-order-1851607894">It’s a bit less creepy, which is nice</a>.</p>

 <p>No price was shared for this new version of the controller, but last time PlayStation sold the <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller, it was priced at $80. Still, the new<em> Astro Bot</em> pad might cost a bit more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135">The boring and ugly <em>Last-of-Us</em>-themed Dualsense controller from Sony cost $85 earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Whatever it costs, you can expect it to go for much more when resellers inevitably grab up a ton of them and sell them on eBay. Heck, the original <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller still goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Astro+Bot+controller&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313">$110 to $160 sealed on the internet’s ancient auction house</a>. So if you really want a joyful <em>Astro Bo</em>t-themed Dualsense controller and you don’t want to pay $200 or whatever, I’d be hanging out at your computer on September 12, ready to pre-order the moment they go live. Good luck with that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">22 years after it began, the Call of Duty video game series is finally getting a Hollywood movie, thanks to a deal between Activision and Paramount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both companies issued a joint statement in which they said the partnership “aims to bring the iconic Call of Duty universe to life on the big screen, delivering an unforgettable cinematic event for fans worldwide.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately we know nothing of the movie itself, except it’s a live-action feature film. There’s no release window, director attached, or cast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty fans have for years wondered why the game hasn’t had an official adaptation, considering Hollywood’s love of war movies. Call of Duty itself is one of the biggest video game franchises of all time, with over 500 million copies sold globally. A movie would benefit from launching into an established audience and instant brand recognition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from today’s announcement:</p><blockquote>Under this milestone partnership, Paramount will develop, produce, and distribute a live-action feature film based on Call of Duty, designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences. Both companies are committed to honoring the brand’s rich narrative and distinctive style, promising an authentic and exciting experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a quote from David Ellison, Chairman and CEO of Paramount, who said he’s a big Call of Duty fan who’s put “countless” hours into the franchise over the years:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true. From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand — thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s an additional comment from Rob Kostich, President of Activision: “Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount has form when it comes to successfully adapting video games. Its hugely popular Sonic movies have proved critical and commercial hits, but it’s worth noting Paramount also made the Halo TV series, which was canceled after Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that all we have now is news of a partnership. Hollywood is littered with the bodies of adaptations that were announced but failed to become a reality for whatever reason. This is an important first step, and perhaps the most promising first step a Call of Duty movie has ever had, but this is far from the end of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it's fun to speculate about what the Call of Duty movie might look like. Will it go down the OG Call of Duty route and tell a World War 2 story? Or will it pick one of the stories already established by the Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-brands? If so, will we see popular characters such as Price, Ghost, and Soap, or Mason, Woods, and Hudson? If we see those characters, which actors will play them? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Call of Duty movie news comes ahead of the crucial launch of Black Ops 7, which launches this November amid what is expected to be stiff competition from rival first-person shooter Battlefield 6. To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback">Activision has U-turned on goofy skins for Black Ops 7’s launch, and will not feature a carry forward option for cosmetics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Gameplay footage of what appears to be Battlefield's new battle royale has surfaced online in an apparent leak, highlighting some features that could distinguish it from the competition.</p><p>About <a href="https://streamable.com/3slup3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">nine minutes of footage</a>, watermarked by a Bilibili user called Misaka_Mikoto_01, shows what looks like an early build of the Battlefield battle royale. The build could be from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-labs-testing-program-kicks-off-again-this-week-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6534336/" data-ref-id="1100-6534336">latest Battlefield Labs test</a>, which began late last week. The beginning of the video includes the loading screen and loadout menu before the player airdrops onto the battle royale's massive map.</p><p>The footage shows buildings and other geometric elements popping in. The player also swims in water and later takes out a sledgehammer to demolish the walls of a bathroom in classic Battlefield fashion. Each wall took about two sledgehammer swings before completely coming down. Grenades, ziplines, and a ladder gadget are also used in the leaked footage.</p><p>Publisher EA publicly confirmed this past summer that the series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">getting a new battle royale</a>. Ripple Effect, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Portal mode and is one of the four studios under the Battlefield Studios banner, is developing the mode.</p><p>This won't be the first time that Battlefield has flirted with the battle royale format--2018's Battlefield V featured Firestorm, which had a max of 64 players. The closing ring was, as the name implies, a giant ring of fire, as opposed to the toxic gas in Call of Duty: Warzone or the storm in Fortnite.</p><p>Releasing during the initial boom of battle royale games, Firestorm didn't take off the same way Warzone, Fortnite, or Apex Legends did. Unlike Warzone, which was free to download separately from the main Call of Duty games, Firestorm required the purchase of Battlefield V.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-is-getting-a-new-battle-royale-mode-it-seems/1100-6533613/" data-ref-id="1100-6533613">teaser for Battlefield 6's yet-to-be-officially-named battle royale</a> features a wave of destructive fire, implying that the new mode is a return to Firestorm.

			<p>A Call of Duty movie adaptation is in the works thanks to a deal between Microsoft-owned Activision and Paramount (which recently merged with Skydance in an $8 billion deal). <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Variety</a>, while the first order of business will be to make this film, the agreement includes the potential creation of a 'Call of Duty universe' across film and television series.</p>



<p>Paramount Chairman and CEO David Ellison said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty, this is truly a dream come true. From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly. We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand – thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation.</em></p>



<p>Rob Kostich, President of Activision, added: </p>



<p><em>Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering. With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise</em>.</p>



<p>It could be rightly said that Hollywood took far longer than expected to catch up with the entertainment behemoth that is Call of Duty, which has been dominating gaming charts for nearly twenty years, especially in the United States. To be fair, a decade ago, The Hollywood Reporter revealed the foundation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a production studio that was supposed to work on a live action cinematic universe based on the IP. They had even identified a director, Italian filmmaker Stefano Sollima, who directed 2018's Sicario: Day of the Soldado. However, this project eventually got put on hold, and Activision Blizzard Studios was shut down in 2021.</p>



<p>This time around, Activision has decided to outsource the production, clearly looking to cash in on the successful recent streak of gaming adaptations across cinema and TV (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Fallout, Sonic, Super Mario Bros.).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> campaign already features a few renowned actors, such as Milo Ventimiglia, Michael Rooker, Kiernan Shipka, and Frankie Adams. It is way too early to talk about the cast for the adaptation, though. </p>

A group of fangame developers have taken it upon themselves to make a new Sonic Rush game for PC, combining the previous Sonic Rush games for Nintendo DS into one "definitive" remastering, with extra stuff and some apparently overdue fixes. Seems bold! I missed the Rush games back in the noughties, but I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-can-a-34-year-old-sonic-level-teach-us-about-videogame-light">do like me a Sonic</a>. Here's a trailer for Sonic Rush Rerun.

<p>
"The idea behind this remaster is to take the greatest strengths of the Sonic Rush trilogy, crank them up to 11, and combine them together to bring this game formula to its PEAK," explain the developers in the blurb. "We want to make a definitive version of Sonic Rush for PC with additional content and to fix the problems with the original game." I assume they're calling it a "trilogy" in light of the general conviction that Sonic Colors is an unofficial third Rush game.
</p>
<p>
I like the energy here, but I fear I must break off this report to deliver an agonising Old Man appraisal of something that has been bugging me for years. PSA game developers: the "up to 11" line is not supposed to be repeated sincerely. It comes from 1984 rock band mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE">there's a scene</a> where lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel shows off his custom amp, which has a volume setting with 11 levels, but isn't actually any louder than an amp with 10 levels. 
</p><p>
It's supposed to be a joke about meaningless exaggeration. But because humans are forgetful, perishable sacks of meat, and perhaps because videogame-adjacent humans especially tend to venerate numbers like gods, I keep hearing the phrase "turn it up to 11" uttered <em>with what sounds like full seriousness</em>.
</p>
<p>
I don't know if there's some kind of central marketing authority I can appeal to, here, but please can you all knock it off, because whenever I read these words in press releases, I feel like I am taking crazy pills. If nothing else, game developers, the nature of the joke means that you don't have to stop at 11. You can turn it up to 12! You can turn it up to 13, even! First one to turn it up to 13 in a press release gets their game an automatic 13/10. Or would do, if we had a scoring system. See, I always give myself an out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to Sonic Rush Rerun. The project lead is MelohRush, who got into fan animations because he played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> and thought it needed "an extra punch of style". These youngsters! So impetuous. According to <a href="https://melohrush.carrd.co/">his portfolio</a>, he's worked on *grits teeth* 11 Sonic projects to date. 
</p>
<p>
He's joined by lead programmer Crimznraze, lead modeller Ozark and a small village of modellers, programmers, level designers, animators, sprite artists, composers, sound designers, voice actors, writers and graphic designers. It's a tidy production. You can find some music for the game's soundtrack on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SonicRushRerun">the Youtube page</a>.
</p><p>
Sonic Rush Rerun has no release date. Thanks to Jeremy for spotting it and lobbing it into the friendly sausage machine that is our news Slack. As ever with fangames, its eventual launch rests on Sega's willingness not to sue the pants off the creators for breach of copyright. Sega have proven pretty relaxed on this front, as large corporations go, and have reaped the fruits in the form of a lively community of Sonicmakers, busily engineering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/many-are-the-nostalgic-2d-sonic-fangames-but-sonic-galactic-might-be-the-best">forms of hedgehog-based entertainment</a> poor Yuji Naka never dreamed of in 1991. Some have gone onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">work for the Blue Blur directly</a>.

              <p>How can it possibly have taken 22 years for a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> movie to go into production? That’s how long it’s been since the very first WW2-themed FPS game in the franchise was released, and yet at no point over its many incarnations and decades has it come to movie theaters. That is about to change, as Paramount has agreed to a deal with Activision to convert the enormously popular shooty-bang games to the big screen.</p> <p>Whether the <em>Call of Duty</em> film will be directly adapted from any particular game or series is as of yet unclear, and given the series has at various points been a somber Second World War simulation, a ludicrous blockbuster futuristic war-wank fantasy, a zombie FPS, and now, more than anything else, a massive multiplayer shooter, that leaves a lot of room. You might imagine if the movie were due out soon, it’d make sense to focus on the <em>Black Ops</em> vein, given that’s the theme of both this and last year’s entries. But since it’s only just being announced as a deal, a million miles away from having a script or appointing a director, it’s possible everyone will be long over that angle by the time anything is released. Going back to the series’ roots also seems an unlikely choice, given WW2 cinema is a very well-trodden path with some legendary films against which it would be compared.</p> <p>Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a press release that the deal is a “dream come true.” He added, “From the first Allied campaigns in the original <em>Call of Duty</em>, through&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”</p>

 <p>Citing&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, presumably in an effort to show the studio has the right sort of form, Ellison said, “We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence…ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand–thrilling longtime fans of <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;while captivating a whole new generation.”</p> <p>There were no clues about the specific approach the creative team would be taking to adapting the franchise in Activision’s grimly banal press blurb either. Activision president Rob Kostich waffled about “the incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world,” and called Paramount “a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment.” Bleurgh.</p>

 <p>I’m fascinated to learn how a deal is only happening now, given&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>‘s dominance over gaming for so many years, and the games that&nbsp;<em>have</em> had cinematic conversions. It would seem like a no-brainer to slap the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” and a colon onto pretty much any war movie and rake it in, given the games long ago abandoned anything about their storytelling that is distinctive or worthwhile. A bunch of men gruffly shouting how cross they are and then running through a crumbling building doesn’t seem like a big stretch for Hollywood.</p> <p>A movie is likely at least three or four years away in the best circumstances, so don’t go trying to book tickets just yet. It seems vastly more likely that it’ll take a lot longer, as the budget will inevitably be enormous, so too many executive eyes will be on the script, then interfering with development, then driving a director off the lot in frustration…</p>

<figure><a title="Capcom vs. SNK 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f3dc2fcd885db/capcom-vs-snk-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been well over two decades since the initial launch of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a>, and although the game is now playable on Switch via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>, fans are undoubtedly desperate to see a brand-new entry.</p>
<p>Someone else who would like to see 'Capcom vs. SNK 3' is none other than Hideaki Itsuno, who served as the director for the second entry. If that's not enough, he also said that he wants to be the one who makes it.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-says-he-wants-to-make-capcom-vs-snk-3-even-though-he-now-works-for-neither/">VGC</a>, Itsuno lamented that he is no longer involved with either Capcom or SNK, but stated that if the companies were to license the game out to him, then he'd love to make Capcom vs. SNK 3. More than anything, however, he is simply keen to make a fresh fighting game; so much so that it's "at the top of my list'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bPF0AVvJULs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPF0AVvJULs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed590388jkwirn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPF0AVvJULs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I do want to make a fighting game like Capcom vs SNK, but now I’m neither Capcom nor SNK. If they license it to me, though, I want to make Capcom vs SNK 3. I want to make a fighting game, and it’s at the top of my list of games I want to make.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itsuno is currently hard at work making a new IP within the action genre; likely similar to the likes of <strong>Devil May Cry</strong> and <strong>Bayonetta</strong>, the former of which flourished under his direction at Capcom. He left the company in 2024 to form Lightspeed Japan Studio, a subsidiary of the Tencent Games-owned Lightspeed Studios.</p>
<p>As for Capcom and SNK, the two have shared multiple collaborations and crossovers over the years, perhaps most notably in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which saw the release of Terry and Mai as playable characters, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fatal_fury_city_of_the_wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, which recently welcomed Ken into its roster.</p>

        <p>I'd tell you how common they are, but I'm one of the folks still waiting for the update to install</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Terminid spelunking update, dubbed Into the Unjust, has dropped from orbit today, September 2nd. Sadly, that hellpod's impact with the game's surface looks to have triggered an uptick in crash reports, and Arrowhead are now busy "working to isolate fixes".</p>
<p>If you missed the update's announcement the other day, Edwin was strapped into the news driver's seat at the time, and has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">nice rundown of what's in it here</a>. He even consulted some very real geographers, the absolute pro. The short version? Terminid cave missions on Hive Worlds to aid Super Earth's efforts to fight an evil cloud, and some new enemies flying around.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Sadly, as Arrowhead have been admirably transparent about in the past, new additions to Helldivers 2 tend to bring with them a helping of new issues that need shooting into submission. Into the Unjust's been no different, with a wave of fresh crash reports leading community manager Katherine Baskin to let players know via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102974129734434919/1412450267361706018">Discord</a> that the devs are on the case.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the issues with crashing, which are NOT in accordance with Super Earth Standards and we are working to isolate fixes now. We apologize for this delay and will report back with updates soon," she wrote. Phew, now the many folks writing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/search/?q=crash&amp;type=posts&amp;t=hour&amp;cId=fb662426-0a5e-4086-836f-d0ebaa1542be&amp;iId=a6e9c0ab-df8d-4b22-9fab-ab9d8c622382">their own individual Reddit posts</a> about encountering crashes can chill out a bit.
</p><p>Speaking of the Helldivers 2 subreddit, in my trip there to check just how widespread the crash chatter was, I ran into a number of folks also registering their unhappiness at quite how beefy the game's file size is getting on PC. As someone who's had the update installing onto my games box since late this morning, and as of yet hasn't had it finish patching all of its files, that really hit me where I live.</p>
<p>It'd be unwise to assume that the file size is the only factor contributing to Helldivers 2 taking a while to update - I'm usually the first to go the other way and assume the problem must be on my end - but given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6f0sf/todays_update_has_now_put_the_pc_build_size_at/">a thread on the subject</a>'s amassed 9.1k upvotes and just under 800 comments in about six hours, landing near the top of the subreddit, it's maybe worth Arrowhead looking into. That said, in my case there's also the fact I've been using my PC to do my job while Into the Unjust's been downloading, and that may well have had an impact.</p>
<p>Regardless, I've got some bug spelunking planned for tonight, so you may well hear about my travails if anything noteworthy or wacky happens.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s Tuesday, but it feels like Monday thanks to Labor Day giving many of us the day off. But that weird feeling and a short week won’t stop the Morning Checkpoint. Today, we learn more about Ubisoft’s potential plans for <em>Rayman</em>, catch up on <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025 news</a>, and see how a group of modders is reviving <em>The Crew</em> after Ubisoft killed its servers last year. Also, another game gets delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>. And good news: The next Benoit Blanc murder mystery movie hits theaters this Thanksgiving.</p> <h2><em>The Crew Unlimited</em> brings the racing game back online</h2> <p>In April 2024, Ubisoft shut down the servers powering its 10-year-old open-world racing game<em> The Crew</em>. This made it unplayable, and that didn’t go over well with fans. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-killing-games-the-crew-lawsuit-shutdown-offline-1851695302">the shutdown led to legal battles and a whole “Stop Killing Games” movement</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">as reported by <em>RPS</em></a>, the game that started all of it has been revived, but not by Ubisoft.</p> <p>Instead, <em>The Crew Unlimited,</em> a free mod for the PC version of the racing game, is being built and supported by a group of modders. The mod, which has been in development for about a year now, is set to arrive on September 15. The core of the mod is a server emulator that will let players essentially trick the game into thinking the official Ubisoft servers are still operating like it’s 2014. You can even, with some work, run the server emulator on your own PC, effectively giving players the offline mode they’ve begged Ubisoft for over the last decade. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034">And something which Ubisoft is adding to<em> The Crew 2</em> and its sequel.)</a></p>

 <p>While the mod looks like it won’t be the easiest thing to set up, videos of it in action look great, with the devs even making some minor fixes and tweaks to <em>The Crew</em> based on fan feedback. If publishers won’t help preserve video games, fans will do it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">It’s been like this for decades, and I doubt anything will change soon</a>.</p> <h2>Another game has been delayed because of <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><em>Silksong’s</em> surprise September 4 launch and $20 price tag have caused many other indie games to panic and flee the days around the game’s release date. And we can add another game to the list:<em> Star Birds</em>. This is the next game from the <em>Dofromantik</em> developers and it’s a colorful strategy management game based on a popular educational YouTube channel. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2719750/view/538863491448046148?l=english"><em>Star Birds</em> was set to arrive on September 4, but will now launch six days later on September 10</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft reportedly wants to make a <em>Rayman 4</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">👊 🎉Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy 🎂🥳</p> <p>Let's kick it off with a special message from Ubisoft Montpellier that was broadcast as part of the fan event Rayman Alive, just minutes ago. <a href="https://t.co/BQ6qavIrVr">pic.twitter.com/BQ6qavIrVr</a></p> <p>— Rayman (@RaymanGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/">A new report from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> claims that the previously reported <em>Rayman</em> remake is progressing nicely, and the plan is to launch the game in 2026. <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">In a new video</a> from Ubisoft celebrating the 30th anniversary of the platforming series, Ubisoft confirmed that it was working on a new <em>Rayman</em> game but warned that more news wouldn’t come anytime soon.<em> Insider Gaming</em> reports that the remake is the new game and that if it sells well enough, Ubisoft will develop a <em>Rayman</em> <em>4</em>. Reportedly, there are already “preliminary plans” in place for that sequel.</p> <h2>Capcom president blames PS5’s high price for soft numbers</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcoms-president-says-high-price-of-ps5-has-contributed-to-low-sales-of-monster-hunter-wilds">As spotted by <em>GamesIndustry.biz,</em></a> in a recent interview, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto partially blamed the “soft” sales of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on the high cost of the PlayStation 5. While <em>MonHun Wilds</em> sold incredibly well out of the gate, becoming the fastest-selling Capcom game in the company’s history, the publisher’s most recent financial results called the game’s sales in Q1 2025 “soft.” According to Tsujimoto, you can blame that on the high price of a PS5 in most parts of the world.</p> <p>“The console costs about ¥80,000 ($538). When you factor in the cost of software and monthly subscriptions, it comes to about ¥100,000 ($672) at the time of purchase. This is not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations. This situation is not limited to Japan, but is similar overseas as well,” said Tsujimoto.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767">Our report on the <em>Borderlands 4</em> rage room at PAX West 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695">Hands-on impressions of <em>Silksong</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s</em> intro is still amazing on Switch 2</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
