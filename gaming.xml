<p>It has been one hell of a year for Fallout.</p>



<p>From the next-gen update for Fallout 4 to the release of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, the post-apocalyptic series has gone from strength to strength in the last twelve months. Earlier this year, the launch of Fallout‚Äôs live-action adaptation caused player counts to skyrocket, and that fact has reflected quite nicely in one particular title.</p>



<p>Fallout 76, the series‚Äô MMORPG entry, has hit 21 million players, according to Bethesda Game Studios. That‚Äôs up from the 17 million that was reported this time last year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-atomic-growth">Atomic Growth</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 had a hard time getting here, but it‚Äôs finally getting the praise and attention it deserves. It took an award-winning television series for many to see the value in Fallout 76, but that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì it‚Äôs a live-service game and it‚Äôll be around for quite some time.</p>



<p>Recently, Bethesda Game Studios has busied itself pouring content into Fallout 76‚Äôs ecosystem, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-map-expansion-coming-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening up new areas</a> and injecting fresh events and updates into the game for the 21 million wasteland wanderers to enjoy.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7xenCy1xRvZBNQE2tHSBSp/thank-you-vault-dwellers?linkId=100000318285297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Bethesda site</a>, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While traipsing along them country roads, we‚Äôve met over 21 million vault dwellers who bravely emerged from Vault 76.</p>



<p>That must be a huge vault!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Fallout 76 was released in 2018, it was to widespread mockery and disappointment, and it took a long time for the game‚Äôs image to stabilise. Even today, many ignorant gamers still believe Fallout 76 is the shell of a title it once was.</p>



<p>Take it from me, a die-hard Fallout fan of 15 years ‚Äì <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-76-good-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 is good</a>, at the very least.</p>



<p>Are you one of the four million new players who found their way into Fallout 76 this year? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Tonight is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2024">The Game Awards 2024</a>, the first since Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/e3-is-officially-dead-say-esa">killed E3 and consumed its heart</a> in front of a group of screaming schoolchildren. Just saying, this had better be good, <em>Geoff</em>, especially after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-embarrassing-indictment-developers-decry-last-nights-the-game-awards-ceremony">2023 show‚Äôs "embarrassing" shooing-off</a> of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.</p>
<p>Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ9Ydz7jo6I">Herald of Darkness performance</a>? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I‚Äôll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.</p>

Jim Carrey has at least one scene in the film dressed as Santa Claus, and now Paramount has released several parody posters referencing holiday film classics. This time, however, they star the blue blur, all his friends, and even his enemies. Paramount picked some of the most obvious seasonal favorites like <em>Elf</em>, <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, and <em>Home Alone</em>, now re-imagined with Jim Carrey‚Äôs face on them. Click through to see all nine posters.<br></p><p>These posters come as part of a ‚Äú12 Hours of Sonic‚Äù promotional push that included several holiday-themed giveaways and a stop-motion short that seems like an homage to the classic Rankin/Bass animated Christmas specials. All the <em>Sonic </em>characters who appear in the short are voiced by their actors from the movie, including Keanu Reeves, who makes a brief appearance as Shadow at the tail end.

<p>The Game Awards 2024 is taking place in Los Angeles, and this year‚Äôs trophies are going to be handed out to some deserving games, creators, and industry personalities. It‚Äôs one of the most highly anticipated shows in years, given that it was the 10th anniversary of the event, and Geoff Keighley and team seem poised to deliver.</p>



<p>While Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything announced at the show, awards will also be given away. Here‚Äôs the full list featuring every winner at The Game Awards 2024. </p>



<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is a running article that will be updated as the awards are announced, so make sure you bookmark this page and refresh the page when winners come in. All of the nominees are listed below.</p>

<p>Leading the way in nominations are Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, each having <strong>seven </strong>nominations to their name, which was a fair spread for sure.</p>



<p>There was some controversy leading up to The Game Awards because of the Game of the Year category, though. Many had issues with Shadow of the Erdtree being put <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forward as ‚ÄòGame of the Year‚Äô </a>because it‚Äôs a DLC and not a full, separate release.</p>

In this deep dive, we will explain how we crafted all the different systems that go hand in hand to achieve this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creative freedom is at the core of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Planet Coaster 2. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">For water parks, this means our players can:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Use free-form building tools to create pools in any shape imaginable</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Place wave machines to create wave pools with interesting wave patterns</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Explore their parks up close, using the new first-person camera</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is very important that the systems we create are highly dynamic and can respond to a wide range of situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also had to be aware of how park visitors will interact with the water. A park can have thousands of guests at the same time. Our talented animators authored thousands of unique pool animations for these guests. We wanted to ensure that all these affect water surfaces in a realistic manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A splash fight and swimming guests create ripples.

These techniques, however, break down when viewed up close.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the water to feel alive and three-dimensional at any distance. To achieve this, we use a dynamic level-of-detail system. This system works by subdividing the triangles of the water mesh based on the camera distance. This ensures that we always have roughly the same amount of geometry on the screen, achieving a constant rendering cost down to the centimeter scale. This approach is very popular for rendering terrain in open-world games, but it is rare to see it applied to water surfaces in such detail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The subdivision of a water surface. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This subdivision allows us to move the geometry of the water surface up and down with the waves and ripples. This adds a lot of plasticity to the water, which is especially noticeable when observing the surface from a shallow angle, e.g., when taking a dip in the first-person camera.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Water ripples in the first-person camera. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also put a lot of thought into the transition that happens when moving the camera underwater. By rendering the water line on the screen, we achieve something termed a "split-shot" in photography; in a screen-space shader, we transform the pixel position to world coordinates and populate a low-resolution texture with the vertical distance to the water surface. We then threshold this distance texture to render a smooth water line. I recommend giving Improved </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">by Chris Green (2007) a read if you‚Äôd like to know more about using distance fields for similar effects.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The rendering pipeline for the water line effect. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our first full update for the game post-launch, we‚Äôll also be adding a fun water droplet effect to the camera as it enters and exits the water.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Bringing water to life">Bringing water to life</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that we can render highly detailed water surfaces, we will look at how we animate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each guest type (kids, teens, and adults) has hundreds of different animations for different pool interactions. All these animations disturb the water in different ways, e.g., a swimming guest will create a wake and pull swirls behind them, and someone cannonballing into a pool may create a big splash. Park guests can also participate in splash fights. Our solution for animating the water surface must dynamically react to these interactions in a plausible manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Humans have a very intuitive understanding of the motion of water, so a fun and lively water animation should be as true to life as possible. To achieve this, we utilize a state-of-the-art fluid simulation. This allows the water to realistically flow around guests, creating swirls and ripples in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There exist plenty of different models for fluid simulations for different use-cases. (As you‚Äôre about to see, we utilize two different fluid simulations for this very reason.) Some of these models may focus more on certain characteristics of fluids, some are fully three dimensional, while others operate in two dimensions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For pools, we are interested in three characteristics of the water: Its vertical displacement (up-and-down motion), its flow (e.g., swirls and vortices), and foam. Our fluid simulation is two-dimensional since we are only interested in surface effects but not the water‚Äôs deeper layers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Displacement, flow, and foam in action. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a high level, our fluid simulation works like this: for each frame, we populate a grid of data, stored as a texture on the GPU, with the current displacement and flow vectors. If we detect that a guest, or any other physics collider, intersects the water surface, we override the corresponding grid positions with a displacement amount and the velocity of the object. The resulting displacement and velocity values are our so-called initial conditions. Using our simulation code, we evolve these initial conditions and render the output. We then use this output as the initial conditions for the next frame, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The data flow of our fluid simulation. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For our simulation code, we needed to choose a mathematical model that matches the requirements of the game. For a simple simulation, one may just use the standard wave equation. Instead, we chose the so-called shallow water equations, which also model displacement and flow. This allows us to animate even more effects, such as swirls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Turning these equations into a computer program is an art in itself, and a plethora of materials on the topic exist, ranging from beginner-friendly YouTube tutorials to highly technical scientific papers. The choice again will depend on the requirements of your game. My advice is to err on the side of simplicity and not get lost in the mathematical intricacies early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the technically inclined, I‚Äôll throw in some jargon (feel free to skip this part): we use a semi-Langrangian formulation of the shallow water equations, which we integrate using the Crank-Nicolson method. Our numerical solver is the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method. Some works we referenced are ‚Äú</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A numerically efficient and stable algorithm for animating water waves‚Äù</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Anita Layton and Michiel van de Panne (2002), </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>‚ÄúA Parallel Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Solver for the Poisson Problem on a Multi-GPU Platform‚Äù</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Marco Ament et al. (2010), and the talk </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>‚ÄúReal-Time Fluid Simulation in Shadow of the Tomb Raider‚Äù </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">by Peter Sikachev (2018). Chapter 38 of ‚Äú</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GPU Gems‚Äù</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2004) also gives a good introduction to the topic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It took us a lot of research as well as some trial and error to arrive at this solution, and it gives us very stable and accurate results. This is important as the player can control the game speed up to five times as fast as real-time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We do all this work on the GPU using compute shaders. GPUs are well suited for this task, as they are extremely efficient in updating each grid point in parallel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also simulate a foam layer on top of the surface, using the outputs from the fluid simulation to dynamically add foam and transport it with the flow of the water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All this gives us a fully dynamic water simulation that naturally reacts to whatever we or the player may throw at it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making waves">Making waves</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the ripples created by park guests, we also allow our players to build wave pools by placing wave machines on the sides of pools. Our players can create interesting and fun wave patterns in this way, and we‚Äôve already seen many creative uses of this tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A wave machine at the end of the pool creates waves in the water. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the waves from wave machines are much bigger than the ripples created by guest interactions, we utilized an additional, different fluid simulation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The model we used here is much simpler than the one used for the guest interactions. We based it on the so-called "hydrostatic pipe model" introduced in ‚Äú</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dynamic Simulation of Splashing Fluids‚Äù</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by James O‚ÄôBrien and Jessica Hodgins (1995): we subdivide each pool into a grid of one-by-one meter cells. Each cell is then connected to its four neighbors by imaginary "pipes," through which water flows freely, based on the height difference between each pair of neighbors. Creating waves then becomes trivial: we periodically remove some water from the pool and then add it back, creating troughs and peaks in the process. This is close to how some wave machines work in the real world!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The hydrostatic pipe model: Each cell has four flow pipes to its neighbors. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As this simulation affects gameplay (guests react to waves), we decided to implement it on the CPU. Each pool runs its own simulation, so we can easily distribute the work across different threads when there are multiple pools in a park. Things become a little trickier when we have a very big pool, however: the only limit to the size of a pool is the size of the playable area. We also need to update the simulation every frame in real-time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Distributing a single simulation onto multiple threads would require complex synchronization code. Instead, we heavily utilize SIMD instruction sets. SIMD is short for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>single instruction, multiple data</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and allows us to perform the same operation (e.g., multiplication) on multiple values in just one CPU instruction. This means we can update multiple grid points in parallel in just one operation! A lot of this code has been hand-tuned and continuously performance-tested to make sure the game always runs smoothly, even in large parks with huge pools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The SIMD instructions can compute eight cells in one go! Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, the wave simulation ended up being so efficient that we decided to use it for the shore waves on our island and coastline levels as well.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How everything flows together">How everything flows together</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this deep dive, we spoke about several systems, each modeling a different aspect of water: we implemented highly-detailed water surface rendering, allowing us to display water surfaces in three dimensions, even when viewed up close. A state-of-the-art fluid simulation dynamically and naturally animates ripples, flow, and foam. And finally, a simple but efficient wave simulation brings wave pools, and even shorelines, to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All these systems have their own focus, and their strengths go hand in hand to create highly detailed, immersive, and creative water parks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you so much for reading and we hope you enjoyed this little dip in the water rendering and physics in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Planet Coaster 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">! Hopefully, you have a clearer picture of how our different water systems work and interact, and maybe some of the techniques we outlined will be useful in your own endeavors or can serve as an inspiration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We‚Äôd also like you to take away from this article that games are complicated machines that consist of many moving parts. Some of these parts will be more complex than others, but they all work together to create the final experience. Do not get discouraged early on. Instead, identify the individual components of your game and iterate on them. Try simple approaches first; in many cases, such an approach will already yield amazing results, leaving you more time to iterate on the more complex areas.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Here we are again. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> is clambering out of his cryochamber for another Lord of the Rings-length showcase, in which new games will be announced, people will be given awards, and there'll probably be a lot of adverts. It's The Game Awards 2024 and you can't miss it. Or, well, you can - you can go to bed but don't do that. Don't leave us on our own.</p>
<p>The show begins tonight at 12.30am GMT, and there's going to be a 30-minute preshow followed by a main show of indeterminate length. These things normally run quite long so be warned - I wouldn't expect to be going to bed much before 2.30am, if not 3am. But don't worry, that's why we're here. We'll be keeping you up to date with everything as it happens, just in case you nod off for a bit.</p>
<p>You can either watch The Game Awards 2024 video stream here, embedded in the article, or pop it on the TV and wake everyone else in your house up.</p>
<p>So: what are we expecting to happen tonight? Some pretty exciting things, actually. The Last of Us maker <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> is expected to unveil its big new thing, which I believe is a new IP, and CD Projekt Red is rumoured to be taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> to the show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-twos-josef-fares-extremely-confident-about-next-project-stating-its-impossible-not-to-be-cocky-when-you-have-a-game-like-this">Josef Fares is already in full Josef Fares mode about his new game</a>, which is being unveiled tonight, and Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country are on the slate for tonight, too.</p><p>There is the actual awards part of the Awards as well, for which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> lead the nominees. Can Balatro beat its blockbuster brethren to get Game of the Year? We will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>See you later on?</p><figure>

Time moves differently during The Game Awards. We might have been watching for an entire year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-it-a-trailer-or-an-ad.1059153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It‚Äôs Game Awards day, when many of us stay up far too late watching an overly-long awards show that every so often remembers it‚Äôs <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed to be an awards show</a>. Yesterday, IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine asked what marks the difference between a Game Awards ad and a Game Awards trailer, and now I‚Äôm bringing that question to you.</p><p>‚ÄúWhenever TGAs are on, there are some trailers where everyone is like ‚Äòoh yeah, trailer!‚Äô and others where everyone goes ‚Äòew commercial‚Äô and tunes out. Setting aside the fact that they are all, yes, technically commercials, what exactly is the differentiator for people in an event like this? ‚Äú Valentine asked on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2qnxjdis2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>. I said this was an interesting question and should be a blog, but since I‚Äôm not the editor of every games journalist out there and cannot in fact assign them blogs, she replied that<em> </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2r6pn2vk2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I </em>should blog it</a> instead. So here we are.</p><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld2r5e2e222d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posited</a> that one difference is whether a video is about a game that‚Äôs already out (ad) or one that‚Äôs upcoming (trailer). <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamoosi.bsky.social/post/3ld2spy6du22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lots</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ld2qst46qk2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sporkyreeve.bsky.social/post/3ld2sujbtnk2j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vitzpatel.bsky.social/post/3ld2srxvgtc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> in Valentine‚Äôs replies shared this sentiment. I also suggested it had to do with the presentation of the video‚Äìwhether Geoff says ‚Äúworld premiere‚Äù or someone who made the game introduces it, or whether it just plays in a string of videos about computers and <em>Fortnite</em> battle passes. This, too, was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ld2roizrbc2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markmedina.bsky.social/post/3ld2rrgpwoc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/michaelroleary.bsky.social/post/3ld2sd4xnq22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentiment</a>.</p><p>Other folks said it was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianaltano.bsky.social/post/3ld2ta7bmfk25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> or the sense of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antoinebordeleau.bsky.social/post/3ld2r34ajrc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artistry</a> behind the trailer; there‚Äôs a narrative to a trailer, or a purpose beyond just telling you something exists to buy. But of course, one purpose of <em>every</em> trailer is telling you that there‚Äôs something you can buy, though that thing might not exist yet. And, of course, there can also be an artistry to ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>More than <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heathercoles.bsky.social/post/3ld2sen6slk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ejsponge61.bsky.social/post/3ld2rtcwmxs2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">person</a> said something along the lines of ‚Äúif I like it, it‚Äôs a trailer,‚Äù which I find to be an accurate and refreshing bit of honesty. I‚Äôd guess the only people who want to get excited about ads are, well, people who make ads. And since the trailers are the ‚Äúevents‚Äù of The Game Awards, turning the thing you‚Äôre excited about into a ‚Äútrailer‚Äù and thus an ‚Äúevent‚Äù can make it feel like you watched a ‚Äúgood‚Äù Game Awards where a lot of things happened, instead of a show stuffed with ads.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I'm partial to this line of reasoning: One of the weird things about The Game Awards, at least from the perspective of someone who's had to cover it, is that it's something that's happening where not a lot of things actually <em>happen</em>. Barring the semi-regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23501270/elden-ring-goty-stage-rushed-bill-clinton-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage-intruding</a> and the occasional excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">musical performance</a>, what <em>are</em> The Game Awards as an event? Is delineating between an ad and a trailer a way to assert narrative and agency into the formless swirl of forced hype that defines the event? (Barring the obvious option that you simply <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not have to watch it</a> at all.) Is the search for trailers humankind's deeper search for structure and meaning? </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to turn Geoff‚Äôs Day of Hype into a philosophical exercise, so weigh in in the comments. I wrote the blog. I hope you‚Äôre happy, Reb.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket is getting a brand new expansion on December 17th, and it is called Mythical Island. The major addition is a brand new booster pack that will add 80 new cards to the game, including new trainers, new EX cards, and new immersive cards. The trailer for the Mythical Island pack shows those cards and some of their abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pok√©mon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island  | Coming Soon!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUYHC2ReohA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mew is the cover Pokemon for this pack, and there will be a Mew EX card. This card has Psyshot as the basic attack, and Genome Hacking will allows Mew to use the attack of the opponent‚Äôs active Pokemon. There is also going to be an Aerodactyl Ex which has an ability to prevent opponents evolving their cards. It also has an 80 damage land crush attack. Some new cards that are spotted in the trailer include a Vaporeon art card, a Dedenne art card, Marshadow art card, Dhelmise, Morelull, a new Magmar,&nbsp; a new Tauros card, a new Exeggute card, and new trainer Blue that reduces incoming damage by 10 points.</p>
<p>There will be a lot more cards, so it is best to start saving up those hourglasses to tear open a whole load of packs in one go. Last month, the development team confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/pokemon-pocket-update-new-booster-packs-limited-trading-january/">new booster packs soon would be coming soon, and limited trading would arrive in January</a>. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>

There are a ton of things it changes, but some of the highlights are nerfs to Afterimage and instant Sparking mode skills, DP fights have capped health bar regeneration when a fighter is on standby, and 1v1 local multiplayer now lets you select from any stage, not just the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. </p><p>The Afterimage nerf is a big one. The skill doesn‚Äôt last as long now and is cancelled out if your opponent uses Perception. Whereas before it resulted in drawn out dodge battles, it‚Äôs now easier to counter. The instant Sparking mode is another major change: the new, increased Skill Count needed to deploy them means players are less likely to be able to spam Sparking mode back-to-back-to-back. DP battles where players go in with a roster of fighters should also move more quickly and smoothly since the recovery rate for constantly swapping them has been reduced (RIP to my OG Z warrior team that eked out wins by constantly tagging in and out). </p><p>The surprise update has so far been met with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near-universal praise on the the subreddit</a></span> where just days prior the community was apoplectic about the state of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and its future prospects for keeping fans engaged.

The results were incredibly faithful to the franchise, but a poor display for a game in 2024 whose main ongoing draw is its ranked mode. </p><p>The doom and gloom metastasized in part because Bandai Namco was tightlipped about <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>‚Äôs roadmap, with no real indication of what feedback it was monitoring or when players could expect fixes. After all the radio silence then, this week‚Äôs big update caught many fans by surprise. It turns out <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>will continue to get fixes, even if they don‚Äôt necessarily come at a clip players might expect from other bigger name fighting games like<em> Street Fighter VI</em> and<em> Tekken 8</em>.<br></p><p>Of course, there‚Äôs still more work to be done. Ranked mode remains far from balanced, and players have already spotted some pretty major bugs, like one apparent issue that lets players restore extra health to standby fighters in the last minute of a match. And <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>‚Äôs single-player content remains shallow and disappointing. It seems possible Bandai Namco could continue adding to that part of the game as well, though likely not for free. There‚Äôs already a big slate of paid DLC planned. </p><p>For now, though, fans can enjoy a new honeymoon phase with latest <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, including as they pick through the update for all of the possible stealth changes that aren‚Äôt even mentioned, like maybe making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Saiyan 3 Goku‚Äôs arms a bit bigger</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, maybe you're currently playing Path of Exile 2 daily. Steam will let you choose to download any updates for the action-RPG immediately, so it's always ready to go when you have time to play. Meanwhile, maybe you go back to Stardew Valley from time to time.

            <p>The anonymous solo developer behind hit poker roguelike Balatro said there's a part of him that regrets the game's success, as he misses when creating games was just a hobby.</p>
<p>LocalThunk, as he's known, wishes to remain anonymous even with the enormous success of the game - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">mobile release alone has reportedly made almost $4.4m</a>.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">GQ</a> if he regrets Balatro's success, he replied: "Honestly, yeah. Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p>

<p>The developer said he treated game creation as a hobby, but the success of Balatro had brought him a huge amount of attention. He even admitted he could retire after this game alone and just make games for fun.</p>
<p>"This last year has been by far the most stressful year of my life," LocalThunk said. "These days I try and think about, what will get me back to where I was when I was making this - when it was relaxing as a hobby. I want to return there."</p><p>He continued: "If I were to make another game after Balatro, which I'm not really thinking about right now, it would be really cathartic to make it and not show anyone. Put it in a folder on my desktop and leave it there. Just for me."</p>
<p>Still, LocalThunk said he planned to continue updating the game in 2025 and had "a lot of fun ideas for directions" to take Balatro, more than just one update's worth, though he doesn't know how many he'll be able to implement.</p>
<p>More jokers are definite though, as he hasn't added any since the game's release.</p>
<p>Balatro is nominated for the big award at tonight's The Game Awards. It's even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">part of the latest Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as a secret quest in collaboration with CD Projekt Red.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fortnite OG has now launched as a separate game type for players to enjoy, and it comes with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">own game pass</a> as well, allowing players to get rewards that they can utilize in Fortnite OG. Within just 20 minutes of the game's release, it managed to get over<a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 1.1 million concurrent players</a>, with this statistic including the OG Zero Build game. This a huge deal for Fortnite, especially after they broke their record for most concurrent users just days before, with 14 million players playing Fortnite on November 30 for the Remix Finale event. Many gamers believe that Battle Royals, including Fortnite, aren't as popular as they used to be. However, Fortnite has seen some groundbreaking statistics for the genre, and the game saw 30 million active users a day during the entirety of 2024.</p>
<p>Fortnite first launched in 2017 and helped the Battle Royale genre skyrocket to new levels of popularity. This game was initially seen as an alternative to PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, which was also launched that year. Compared to PUBG, Fortnite was entirely free-to-play, with the option to purchase cosmetic items such as skins and bling.</p>
<p>While there are many different reasons why Fortnite continues to remain popular today, a lot of it comes from the massive names they've seen collaborate with the game. The game has seen live events and concerts, such as those of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and even Ariana Grande. While these types of events do sound somewhat like a fever dream, they always have a massive turnaround and bring new players to the game.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Fortnite Remix Finale event took place on November 30, where performers such as Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Ice Spice participated. Snoop Dogg even provided a performance of "Another Part of Me (feat. Sting)" for the event. Admittedly, numbers did drop significantly after the event finished, but Fortnite continues to be incredibly popular, even after seven years of being active.</p>
<p>A lot of the popular events in the game revolve around the OG content, with a lot of the events being temporary maps that players can enjoy for a limited time. However, December 6 saw Fortnite OG be added to the game as a separate game type, now providing players with even more choices as to what experience they play in Fortnite.</p>
<p>Players who want to participate in Fortnite OG will get the choice between the original experience, which includes loot, locations, and features from the original experience. Alternatively, they can play OG Zero Build mode, which means players don't have to farm materials and build structures to survive.</p>

            <p>
Payday developer and publisher Starbreeze has officially sanctioned Notoriety, a popular heist shooter in Roblox, that previously existed as a Payday-inspired fan game.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/21532277/Notoriety-A-PAYDAY-Experience-READ-DESC#!/about">Notoriety</a> will now be relaunched within Roblox as Notoriety: A Payday Experience and feature "authentic Payday assets, characters and heists". 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the terms of this deal involve for both Starbreeze and Notoriety's development teams, though Notoriety is a hugely popular - and lucrative - Roblox experience, with more than 227m visits and 1.3m favourites from players on the platform.
</p>
<p>
"Notoriety was born out of a love for heist games, with Payday serving as a key source of inspiration," Notoriety developer Evan Pickett said in a Starbreeze press release today. "This official licensing partnership allows us to stay true to our vision while incorporating elements that fans of both Notoriety and Payday will recognise and enjoy."
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
For its part, Starbreeze said it "deeply admire[s] the skill, passion, and creativity that Evan has poured into crafting Notoriety" and that licensing Payday out opened up the Payday universe to "a fresh perspective". Hey, 227m visits means a lot of eyes on the Payday franchise. 
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> launched back in October 2023 and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">struggled to capture the same level of interest as its decade-old predecessor</a>. Various <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">game updates have followed</a> to try and turn things around, though the project's commercial failure has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">Starbreeze's CEO ousted</a>, its previous game director step down, and one employee describe its launch as "disastrous". 
</p>
<p>
"The whole stage just collapsed and everyone left," Starbreeze community head Almir Listo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">said back in October</a>. "The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/tamashii-chronicles-of-ascend-review-uniquely-neon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Straight off the bat,&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> looks <em>Cyberpunk</em>. The box, the artwork and the components on opening it scream like something out of a dystopian future full of rogue machines and evil corporations. But does this scenario-drive board game feel <em>Cyberpunk</em>? In our review, we'll talk about how some of the mechanics work, and how it feels to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=0mwLJrVh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=XuswDyTN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>&nbsp;A part of the game in&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> is played on a hex map (Photo Credit: Awaken Realms).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamashii, </em>players represent a group of rebel allies battling against an omnipresent AI. Players have a unique ability to jump into the bodies of others, seeking out and selecting those that are best pace to achieve what they need to.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do when you start playing <em>Tamashii</em> is to choose a scenario, of which the core box includes 11 (including the prologue and finale). After the prologue, you can play the scenarios in any order, but you can only play the finale once you've gotten certain results on the scenario progress sheet.</p>

<p>In each&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>scenario, games&nbsp;are split between 2 key areas. The first is a map made up of hex tiles that represent the areas you will interact with. It works extremely well as a visual representation of how your character interacts with the world. Each tile isn't an area in a building, or even a necessarily linked building or street, but simply areas that your consciousness moves through as you progress. Each map tile offers a reward for being there, but each turn you remain there increases the trace value making it more likely you'll be found, and enemies stronger when they do.</p>

This dashboard has a slot for the current body you inhabit, along with slots for upgrades, the trace track, which details how strong enemies are when they find you, and a place for enemy cards, because they attach to you, and not your character on the map. They also stack and build up on each other.</p>

<p>The final part of the dashboard, and the key part in the center, is the launcher, where you have different colored tokens. The arrangement of these tokens can unlock abilities and allow you to use basic actions along with giving access to the bodies that you can inhabit.</p>

<p>The game takes place over 4 phases, the planning phase, where you can move the tokens around on your dashboard in order to create the required patterns, the action phase, where you move and launch the actions from your dashboard, then combat and then the quest phase.</p>

<p>The rulebook doesn't do a great job of taking you through the game, but honestly, once you've played a game or 2, it all fits together nicely, and you'll enjoy the scenarios immensely, you just need to persevere when learning the rules.</p>

<p>The only characters you can play in <em>Tamashii </em>are those of the bodies you inhabit. There are 8 available initially, plus those built into your dashboard, each with their own pattern cost to inhabit and their own abilities and powers. The first bodies available are:</p>

<p>You don't hack as such in <em>Tamashii</em>, but the whole experience combines to create an extremely thematic <em>Cyberpunk</em> vibe. It all feels weirdly disembodied, the enemies attaching to you, the focus on the patterns and launching programs (which can defeat enemies without even going into combat), and the interaction with the world through the map, as well as the different bodies you can inhabit. I was honestly pretty skeptical about it at first, but it's captured the <em>Cyberpunk</em> theme better than any board game I've played previously, and aside from the original <em>Netrunner</em> card game, gives an extremely pleasing mechanics experience for hacking and jacking into bodies.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p><em>Tamashii </em>is an incredible <em>Cyberpunk</em> experience, once you get into it. The rulebook feels like hard work, but once you know what you're doing, it all feels incredibly thematic and satisfying. I'm usually slating games for their skin-deep theme, but&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>has really captured it, between the two areas of the game, and the scenarios themselves, it's a rich environment that feels completely attuned to the mechanics it uses. It's a rewarding experience overall.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>If you love all that is&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>is for you. You will love the look and the rich theme that the mechanics capture throughout. If <em>Cyberpunk</em> isn't your thing, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>loses some of its flair, as its real focus is on the scenarios that might not carry through on just the mechanics alone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update that adds the ability to play splitscreen across all of the game's stages, as well as new gameplay adjustments and more.</p>

<p>As the update's patch notes reveal, offline splitscreen matches can now be held in any of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s twelve stages. Previously, splitscreen play was limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber stage, but that limitation has officially been removed.</p>

<p>Back in June, Bandai Namco said it would be "difficult" to implement local splitscreen play while retaining&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s "core elements" of busy effects and terrain destruction, which is likely why splitscreen was previously limited to the largely-empty Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=OhDRUS0k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=PTdv00ez 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>now lets you play splitscreen on any stage.</figcaption></figure><p>However, now, thanks to this latest update's rather nebulous assertion that the devs have "improved performance and ease of use", it's possible to enjoy splitscreen play across any number of&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s levels.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the only improvement the update brings. You can also expect a number of quality-of-life improvements and gameplay adjustments, including the ability to skip battle animations during online matches, as well as a new High-Speed Dragon Dash move that lets you close distance to your opponent.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can read the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.asia/sea/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-free-update-1112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. I'd say it's almost certainly worth doing so if you're planning to jump into online play anytime soon.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest installment in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighting games, and the first game in the series since 2007's&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em>. Unlike previous games, it bears the series' original Japanese name of&nbsp;<em>Sparking!&nbsp;</em>in the West as well.</p>

<p>Placing an emphasis on lore-accurate power levels and movesets instead of pure competitive balance,&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>became the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">highest-charting Steam debut</a> when it launched in October, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million copies in a single day</a>.</p>

To accompany this news, the <em>Pocket</em> devs have revealed a rather big surprise: there‚Äôs to be a new special set of Mew-themed packs called Mythical Island, arriving in the game on December 17.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What‚Äôs Coming Out Beyond Pok√©mon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What‚Äôs Coming Out Beyond Pok√©mon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It was widely expected that a new set would join (rather than replace, given the game‚Äôs so-far redundant ‚ÄúSelect Expansion‚Äù page) the launch set, Genetic Apex, at the end of January, as this would follow the three-monthly cycle of the real-world version of the TCG. But I don‚Äôt think anyone was expecting a new ‚ÄúThemed Booster Pack‚Äù set before the end of the year. That‚Äôs the designation given to Mythical Island, which‚Äîand I‚Äôm speculating somewhat here with ambiguous information‚Äîappears to be a smaller ‚Äúspecial set‚Äù (it‚Äôs coded ‚ÄúA1a‚Äù, to Genetic Apex‚Äôs ‚ÄúA1‚Äù), with just Mew pack art, that‚Äôll throw some excellent spanners into the current meta.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> has so far featured just Genetic Apex, the unfortunately named set (everyone else sees it as the codename for a <em>Wolfenstein</em>-style enemy project, right?) that has featured Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. While collecting the entire set <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">would take you over a year</a></span> without paying astonishing amounts of money, it‚Äôs been around long enough now that most people have the cards to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">build the decks that are dominating the meta</a></span>. In fact, if you take part in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406">fun new Emblem Event</a></span>, you‚Äôll almost inevitably face either the Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise or Pikachu decks, almost without variation. So what the game really needs is a bunch of new cards thrown in to explode all that.</p><p>So hooray for news of Mythical Island in less than a week. The trailer flashes a whole bunch of new cards, including of course a Mew ex, which has a single energy 20 damage attack, but then a very Ditto-like ability for three energy (and energy of <em>any</em> type, making this a strong addition to any deck) called Genome Hacking. This lets you ‚Äúchoose 1 of your opponent‚Äôs Active Pok√©mon‚Äôs attacks and use it as this attack.‚Äù</p><p>However, I think the real game-changer is going to be an Aerodactyl ex that has an Ability to prevent your opponent from evolving their Active Pok√©mon. Given how much of the meta is based around such a move, this should shake things up! Better get used to evolving on the bench.</p><figure id="" data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pok√©mon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A series of Pok√©mon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pok√©mon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pok√©mon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also briefly glimpsed is a Vaporeon special art with a new Ability to transfer water energy between cards, and gorgeous special arts for Dedenne and Marshadow.</p><p>There are new Trainers, too, including Blue, who will reduce all incoming damage for a turn by 10 points, and Leaf who‚Äôll really mess everything up by reducing retreat costs on your Active Pok√©mon by <em>two</em>.
