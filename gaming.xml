			<p>Developer Oxide Games and publisher Stardock Entertainment have announced Ashes of the Singularity II, a sequel to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-9-7900x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-appears-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-benchmark/">2016 original</a> that is set to arrive sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>The news came along with an announcement trailer that showed off a cinematic look at the game, but unfortunately did not show off any gameplay. Ashes of the Singularity II continues the story of the first game, with humanity coming together to fight back against a highly sophisticated AI that has overrun most of the Earth.</p>

<p>"<em>Ten years ago, we set a new, literal benchmark for RTS games with massive battles and groundbreaking technology,</em>" says Stardock Entertainment's chief executive officer, Brad Wardell, in a press release. "<em>With Ashes of the Singularity II, we're raising the bar even higher, delivering strategic gameplay depth that RTS fans have always dreamed of.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Obviously, in the first game the number one request was to have a human faction</em>," Wardell continued. "<em>Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines. We're really excited to bring the humans into the war and watch how they fare against the massive mechanical armies of the Substrate and the PHC.</em>"</p>

            <p>
Former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah has posted a sprawling video about the development of Anthem, EA and BioWare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">ill-fated</a> mech <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> shoot-me-do. We've heard about this remarkably torrid period in the RPG developer's existence from other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-never-grasped-dragon-ages-value-as-an-rpg-says-inquisition-writer">ex-BioWare honchos</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-cancelled-rumour">anonymous sources</a>, but perhaps never quite this extensively: the video tops out at an hour long, and this is just part one.

<p>
There's a bit of gossip and speculation from Darrah, but it's an engrossing listen, assuming you're not absolutely sick of the tale of how EA's GaaSy ambitions screwed up BioWare. Here are some highlights based on a quick skimplay.</p>
<p>Darrah begins with the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>, at which point EA were apparently really hammering home the "single player games are dead" angle, and trying to get BioWare onto live service gaming. It was at this point that Mass Effect 3 game director Casey Hudson pitched Dylan, the early codename for Anthem. EA higher-ups apparently loved the talk of a new approach to multiplayer storytelling, but the Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams were, Darrah continues, less than thrilled by the Dylan team's suggestion that BioWare had to move with the times.
</p>
<p>
Darrah himself is ambivalent about Dylan's initial pitch, calling it vague. This vagueness created problems in 2014 when Hudson left the studio, with nobody else quite sure what the game was supposed to be. According to Darrah, too much time was spent at this stage defining the game against the likes of Borderlands and Destiny.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, there were arguments that Dragon Age 4's development team should be reassigned to the Dylan project. Other spats include a fiery response to a particular demo from Patrick Soderlund, CEO of Battlefield developers DICE, and negative feedback from EA to a perceived reduction in the number of Anthem exosuits, or Javelins, based on some WIP figures.
</p>
<p>
As for the name, there was a push to call it Javelins, but EA preferred "Beyond", only to discover that Sony already had a trademark for this. Darrah notes humorously in passing that the original Dragon Age didn't even have dragons when it was given that name.
</p>
<p>
The video brings us up to approximately late 2017, when Darrah himself became involved with Anthem. Look out for the second part down the line. Thanks to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-darrah-talks-about-the-early-development-of-anthem.1263345/">Resetera</a> for passing this on.

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock ‘N Awesome, goes live tomorrow and ahead of that, the developers have revealed all the new additions of this season. </p>



<p>Fortnite’s Power Rangers collaboration was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-power-rangers-collaboration-confirmed-in-new-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed yesterday</a> through a brand new teaser by Epic Games. The same teaser also revealed that Chapter 6, Season 4 is called Shock ‘N Awesome and will have players dealing with hordes of bugs. The latest blog post provides all the details of the new season, including new POIs, weapons, enemies and more. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome-update-details">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome Update Details </h2>



<p>Bugs have infested Fortnite in the new season, and players will have to stomp and smash this swarm with the O.X.R., the Island’s anti-bug military defence force.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-pois">New Fortnite POIs</h3>



<p>Four new POIs have been introduced in the latest Fortnite Season, including The Hive, Swarmy Stash, O.X.R. HQ. and Rangers Ruin. The Hive exhibits signs of high insect activity, and players are bound to encounter a swarm in this area. O.X.R. HQ is where players will find troops stationed in barracks, commanders at battle operations, an OXR Armoury, and more. The Rangers Ruin is a former weapons lab, formerly an O.X.R. base, that was overrun by an infestation. No specific details about Swarmy Stash were revealed. </p>

<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-bug-enemies">New Fortnite Bug Enemies</h3>



<p>There are three types of new bugs Fortnite will introduce in Chapter 6 Season 4, Shock ‘N Awesome, including the Swarmer, Bomber and the Queen. The Swarmer is a bottom-feeder, but it can take you down if not dealt with quickly. Bombers are bugs that are guarding nests. They can burrow and pop up behind the player and also attack with a goop lob from afar. Last, but not least, is the Queen, a massive bug that is taller than most buildings. She can body slam you or even summon more bugs to make your life difficult. </p>

<h3 id="h-new-fortnite-shock-n-awesome-weapons-boons-and-medallions">New Fortnite Shock ‘N Awesome Weapons, Boons and Medallions</h3>



<p>When dealing with hordes of massive bugs, players will need appropriate equipment to take them down, and that’s where O.X.R. comes in. The game now features O.X.R. ranks, and all players start with a C rank and can progress up to S+ rank with their party. Each rank up will provide players with an O.X.R. Drop Pod, which brings a lot of loot and a Super Soldier Boon. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h4>



<p>There’s a special weapon, the Bug Blaster, which can shoot loose explosive plasma projectiles and deal a heavier attack when charged. The other new item is called Roly Poly, which allows players to roll and bounce around the map or charge it up and unleash a big burst of speed. There are some O.X.R. issued weapons too, including Leadspitter 3000&nbsp;minigun,&nbsp;Sweeper Shotgun,&nbsp;O.X.R. Rifle,&nbsp;Wrecker Revolver, and the laser-guided&nbsp;Swarmstrike&nbsp;rocket launcher. </p>



<p>With this season introducing Power Rangers to Fortnite, we also receive a special themed sidearm, the Blade Blaster. It is a sci-fi energy pistol that can fire in quick-tap mode or charged bursts. The other exotic weapons and items include Eradicator O.X.R. Rifle, Double Trouble, Shock N’ Slow Shockwave Launcher, Marksman Wrecker Revolver and Exotic Slap Berry Fizz. </p>

<h4 id="h-boons">Boons</h4>



<p>Coming to Boons, players will find new sets in O.X.R. chests and Hive Sacs, they can also be purchased from the Armory. There are three standard boons: Agile Aiming, Extended Magazine, and Storm Forecast. Then there are 4 Super Soldier-Ranked Boons, which are exclusive to O.X.R. drop pods. The Super Soldier Boon Rank B provides reduced energy consumption during sprint, Rank A boon provides Rank B abilities with increased reload speed. Rank S provides A and B abilities with reduced weapon recoil and spread, Rank S+ provides A, B and S abilities with increased sprint speed and unlimited energy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h4 id="h-medallions">Medallions</h4>



<p>When clearing out swarms in certain POIs, players will be able to battle one of three Queen Bugs. Each bug provides a unique mythic weapon and medallion. Check out what each Queen provides at the three POIs below: </p>



<ul>
<li>The Hive’s Queen delivers players with Mythic Enhanced Wrecker Revolver and&nbsp;Surge Medallion, which increases movement speed and gives a burst of speed when sliding. </li>



<li>Ranger’s Ruin Queen provides players with a Mythic Tactical Shotgun and&nbsp;Springleg Medallion, which gives you the ability to double jump, with fall damage immunity. </li>



<li>Demon’s Domain Queen pgives Mythic O.X.R. Assault Rifle and&nbsp;Carapace Medallion&nbsp;which gives 50 Health when you eliminate an opponent, and passively gives 3 Shield per second up to 50 Shield.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-whirlybird">Whirlybird </h3>



<p>Fortnite’s Shock N’ Awesome season will also introduce the Hammerhead Choppa later in the season. It functions like a helicopter and can briefly hover mid-air when players switch seats to lay down suppressing fire on the other side. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-new-blitz-royale-poi">New Blitz Royale POI</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the new Fortnite Blitz Royale POI, which comes with new medallions and mythics. On August 12, players will be able to take flight with Kinetic Ore as the new Oathbound Citadel POI arrives on the map. On August 19, new Medallions, Boons, and select Mythics &amp; Exotics from Shock ‘N Awesome will be added.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-regrets-board-game-review-like-bringing-dredge-to-the-tabletop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deep-regrets-board-game-review-like-bringing-dredge-to-the-tabletop.1263612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, a video game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dredge-review">Dredge</a> hit a collective nerve with its story of trawling the seas for an increasingly horrible and disturbing catch of fish. One of the people it inspired was horror fan and board game designer <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/114290/judson-cowan" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judson Cowan</a>, and he set about riffing on its inspiration to deliver a cardboard equivalent, a marriage of theme and delivery as yet untapped on tabletop. </p><div catalogid="38514f7c-d341-458a-a4e6-6515bd2c8acb" id="226461"><div id="226461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Deep Regrets</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is Deep Regrets, and we’ve climbed aboard and sailed it out so we can check whether all’s shipshape and Bristol fashion. We also wanted to see how it compares to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games"><u>top horror board games</u></a> on the market. </p></div><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192418469-1754491160356.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Deep Regrets comes in a small box but it’s heavy with contents. Lifting the lid reveals a number of small player boards. There’s a main one to track the fish swimming in the three different depth levels available to dredge, a port board for when you sail back to dry land to sell your catch and equip your boat, the ocean madness board that tracks each player’s state of mind, and a number of double-sided player boards for tracking the status of your game. The sides are functionally identical, it’s just that one side has a sinister-looking old sea dog and the other side has... an even more sinister-looking old sea dog. That tells you a lot about what kind of game this is going to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the weight comes from various decks of cards. There are three decks of fish, one for each depth, plus a deck of “dinks,” tiny fish you can gain if your main catch gets away. There are also decks of rods, reels and “supply” that you can buy at port. The biggest deck of all is the deck of regrets which you pick up for undertaking regrettable actions at sea. There’s also a cloth bag of custom dice shaped like fishing floats, various chunky wooden tokens and a metal “fish coin” used to flip and resolve some card effects. Finally there’s a paper pad for tracking your catches in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> variant.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest deck of all is the deck of regrets which you pick up for undertaking regrettable actions at sea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate just how evocative the visual design of the game is. Everything is decorated with art by the game’s designer, even the inside of the box lid. He’s a talented artist, creating detailed, imaginative visuals that strike a pitch-perfect stylistic balance between fun and creepy. Once you start flipping the fish cards, the chance to see new ones, or re-examining familiar ones for details that you missed becomes a major draw to replay the game alongside the fun of dice-rolling and decision-making.</p><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How it Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250725-101709531-1754491251318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is normally played over six days from Monday to Saturday. Each day starts out with you rolling your clutch of dice and placing them in your fresh pool: you start with three but can gain more, which have higher numbers than your starting dice. You then make one of the game’s key decisions, whether you’ll spend the day at sea or head to port. Everyone starts at sea, so we’ll go through the possible actions as you plough the waves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of your turns at sea involve trying to catch fish. Each depth has three card piles, called shoals, and the card backs indicate whether the card represents a small, medium, or large fish, with bigger fish generally taking larger dice values to catch. You pick which shoal you want to fish in and flip the top card. Some fish have effects when revealed, such as the whiptail stingray, which allows you to reroll one die. All fish have a value in “fishbucks” in one corner and a difficulty value in the other. To catch a fish, you’ve got to spend dice equal to the difficulty. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192131139-1754491385922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes flipping fish a calculated gamble, as it’s possible you won’t have enough dice to reel in whatever horror you’ve hooked. If you can’t, you get to take a dink card as a consolation prize, which generally gives you a small bonus like the shrimp, which reduces the difficulty of a fish by one. In addition, not all fish are created equal. Some have values that are significantly different from their difficulty, while others can have both good or bad effects on you or other players when caught. They also come in two flavors: fair, which are normal, real-world fish, and foul, which are body parts, repulsive mutants, occult creations and worse.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They come in two flavors: fair, which are normal, real-world fish, and foul, which are body parts, repulsive mutants, occult creations and worse.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However you fare in the fish lottery, the process is almost always enormously fun. For starters, there’s the big reveal, not only with the anticipation of matching the difficulty against your dice but of seeing what kind of freakish thing you’re up against and enjoying the art. There may be a reveal effect to resolve, many of which affect all players or otherwise mix up the expected catching process. Then, you may have an awkward decision about whether you want to spend multiple dice on it, whether you even want it at all, or whether it’s better to sacrifice a die and take the relative safety of a dink draw instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending days at port allows you to sell fish for their value and buy equipment. Rods, reels and supply cards all help your fishing efforts in various ways, and you can also buy additional one-use dice to roll, meaning you can land more and more difficult fish. But be careful with what you sell, because the value of your unsold fish is your score at the end of the game. You can also mount fish into one of three slots while in port, which multiplies their value by two or, in the top “prize catch” slot, three. Choosing which days to spend in port rather than at sea is a key strategic decision in which you’re torn between wanting better fish to sell or mount, and wanting to spend as much time on the waves for a bigger catch.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192035419-1754491715291.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing foul fish generally leads to you drawing regret cards. Each of these has a numeric value between zero and three as well as a narrative tagline which varies from bleakly funny – “got a bad tattoo” – to seriously sinister – “partook of human flesh.” Depending on the number of regret cards you’ve accumulated, you may go increasingly mad, slowly reducing the value of fair fish, boosting that of foul fish and raising the maximum number of dice you’re allowed to use in a day’s fishing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s a major catch. While the number of cards you have is public knowledge, the values on them are not, and the player with the highest total value at the end of the game must discard one of those precious mounted specimens and the multiplier that goes with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice aren’t just spent on catching fish but can also be discarded to allow you to fish in deeper waters, which have more difficult targets and a higher proportion of foul fish. This allows you to manipulate an overall strategic curve. You can save dice, stay in safe waters, maximizing the value of your fair fish and resting safe in the knowledge you won’t be the one discarding when the game ends. Or you can dredge the depths, catching more and more appalling abominations, revelling in the horror and crossing your fingers that you’ll have fewer bleak regrets than your fellow fishermen when the game ends. Or try to chart a course between the two extremes, adjusting carefully depending on other player’s decisions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192659428-1754492137500.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On a tactical level, the game gathers momentum towards the finale. Initial fishing trips are fairly bland but as you begin to gain dinks, equipment, and a collection of fish, some of which can be eaten for an immediate ability, you can start to look for combo effects between the different cards. This snowballs as you get more and more of each, meaning you can pull off some pretty spectacular fishing turns late in the game, once you’ve learned to spot them. But each of these is laden with various risk vs reward decisions, most obviously that eating a fish means you no longer benefit from its value. In particular, once the regret deck runs out, additional regrets must be taken from other players, making for some very swingy turns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are definite strategic and tactical choices of this kind in the game, it’d be overselling things to make too much of them. Fundamentally, this is a push-your-luck game where you’re eternally hoping for the highest dice rolls, the best fish card reveals, and for the fish-coin flips to always go your way. Experience and planning help, but anyone around the table can win, with that hidden regret value being particularly punishing. This cuts both ways, as it can make the game feel over-long at high player counts, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>hardcore strategy hounds</u></a> may find the game too lightweight to satisfy, but newer players will enjoy rolling with the punches in the knowledge that they’re in with a chance to win right up until the bitter end.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250606-212534925-1754492525443.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8de?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAyKm?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Game Nerdz</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRypK?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Tettix</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 6, 2025 4:12 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Given that our real-world deep ocean trenches are full of nightmarish life forms, horror fishing isn’t an especially new idea in games. However, rarely has it been delivered with such a delightful balance of horror and humor, nor strategy and randomness. The result is a game that’s simply fun, thanks to its engaging artwork and push-your-luck mechanics, and what it fails to deliver in demanding strategy, it makes up for in thrilling moments and entertaining discoveries. Your sinister fisherman alter-ego might be piling up the regrets from time spent on the waves, but you’ll sail home to port with little buyer’s remorse at all.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-regrets-board-game-review-like-bringing-dredge-to-the-tabletop]]></content:encoded>

In fact, there are a total of four precons available for fans of Magic’s most popular format. Even better yet, Amazon has finally dropped the price of three of the decks and a bundle that includes all four.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Finally Discounts Final Fantasy MTG Commander Decks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, each of the decks focuses on a different entry in the series, and while I personally would’ve loved an Eikon-focused deck inspired by Final Fantasy 16, the ones we get are focused on the sixth, seventh, tenth, and fourteenth entries instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As has been the case,<a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OxDL?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Final Fantasy 6’s Revival Trance is under MSRP</u></a>, and it’s now down to a new low of $50.36 (according to price tracker CamelCamelCamel).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy x Magic: The Gathering - Commander Decks Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also at all-time lows are <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnyE6?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 10’s Counter Blitz</u></a> (now $64.18), and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObkWD?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 14’s Scions and Spellcraft</u></a> at $60.51.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47KZD?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 7’s Limit Break deck is still sitting at $89.84</u></a>, which is more than MSRP.

That’s pricey, but is still <em>slightly</em> cheaper than buying all four at their current prices.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The MTG Final Fantasy Commander Decks - Ranked</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s great to buy Commander Decks to collect, we’re going to rank them for how well they play out of the box (without upgrades). Still, as with any deck ranking, this is entirely subjective, and there’s nothing to stop you from having a ton of fun with any of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that out of the way, here’s our ranking.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Revival Trance</h3><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="222831"><div id="222831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Revival Trance Commander Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not just focused on Final Fantasy 6, but specifically the back half of the game, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OxDL?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Revival Trance</u></a> is helmed by Celes, tasked with rebuilding a party after the world goes to ruin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’d be a great theme for a revival deck, but there aren’t that many cards that, well, revive fallen comrades from your graveyard or anyone else's.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also no big reprints of note here, which is a shame.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Scions and Spellcraft</h3></div><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="222832"><div id="222832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Scions and Spellcraft Commander Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObkWD?object_uuid=40216374-35ea-4248-a13a-293b662e6f95&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 14’s Commander deck</u></a> is somewhat of a rare beast insofar as it’s a spellslinger-style deck in Esper colors (White, Black, Blue).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, its focus is on non-creature spells and dishing out damage with Y’Shtola, one of the two Commanders.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls  - PS5 Closed Playable Beta Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>That's an ambitious goal for the Marvel fighting game, but not entirely impossible. For comparison, Capcom has supported its last three mainline Street Fighter games for several years after launch with gameplay overhauls and new characters, and Arc's Guilty Gear Strive has regularly been updated with new characters since it launched in 2021--including Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/guilty-gear-strive-official-lucy-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-season-pass-4/2300-6466227/" data-ref-id="2300-6466227"> who joins the game later this month</a>.</p><p>The challenge here lies in keeping interest in the game alive, as it'll take more than just an influx of new characters on a regular basis to keep fans interested, no matter how good the gameplay is. Marvel's parent company, Disney, likely won't pass up the opportunity to license the IP out to another studio for a different fighting game, if the pitch is solid enough. A lot can also change in the span of a decade, but you have to admire just how confident Sony is about this upcoming game.</p><p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls doesn't have a set release date yet, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-how-to-sign-up/1100-6533659/">but you can sign up for the upcoming closed beta right now</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-marvel-fighting-game-is-coming-from-arc-system-works/1100-6532114/">First revealed in June</a>, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-every-character/2900-6640/">current roster includes iconic characters</a>--Captain America, Doctor Doom, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, Star Lord, and Storm--and with enough time, that roster could grow into a pantheon of costumed brawlers. The goal to support the game for years to come could also allow for several surprise characters to be added to the game, like Taskmaster, Nova, or Uncle Ben--if he's given a one-hit health bar.</p>

The new studio debuted today, with a stated focus on "advancing the rhythm game genre."</p><p>If RedOctane conjures memories of plastic guitars for you, it should; RedOctane was the moniker for brothers Charles and Kai Huang's rhythm game studio, one half of the partnership (alongside Harmonix Music Systems) that brought Guitar Hero to the world. According to the studio's press release, the new RedOctane Games will have Charles and Kai Huang on a special advisory board. Simon Ebejer, the production director on several Guitar Hero games at Neversoft, is also at the helm as studio head.</p><p>"Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay they’re about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other," said Ebejer in a statement. "RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMpdAXrO3tk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMpdAXrO3tk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>RedOctane Games is apparently already underway with its rhythm-focused goals, as the team has already gone through pre-production and entered production on its debut rhythm-based game, which will be announced later this year.</p><p>The new RedOctane Games exists within Freemode, one of the Embracer Group's subsidiaries, alongside the likes of Limited Run Games and Middle-Earth Enterprises.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/06/redoctane-games-is-a-new-rhythm-game-studio-founded-by-guitar-hero-veterans]]></content:encoded>

Xbox Insiders can start testing a preview of the Gaming Copilot integration in the Game Bar today, and Microsoft is planning “further optimizations” for this new feature on the upcoming Xbox Ally handhelds.</p><p>“Gaming Copilot knows what you’re playing and understands your Xbox activity to provide an experience centered around you,” says Taylor O’Malley, principal program manager at Xbox. You’ll be able to ask the Copilot for help with the game you’re playing, as well as access achievements and play history. The Gaming Copilot will be available as a widget inside the Game Bar, and it includes a voice mode so you can talk to the AI assistant without having to alt + tab out of a game.</p><p>The Gaming Copilot will even use screenshots of your game to help answer questions about it, without you having to describe things in detail. That could be as simple as asking “what am I looking at?” while facing a boss in a game, and Copilot should respond with details about the boss and perhaps even methods to take it down.</p><p>This is the first step in Microsoft’s vision to turn its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Xbox Copilot into an AI gaming coach</a>. Microsoft is positioning the Gaming Copilot as a sidekick, one that will accompany you through games and offer tips and information about game worlds. Microsoft has previously demonstrated using the Gaming Copilot with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, letting it recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team.</p><p>This early preview is only available in English and limited to the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and a few other regions. Microsoft isn’t making it available in the UK or any other European markets yet. It’s planning to release the Gaming Copilot in additional regions at a later date, but it’s not clear yet when exactly that will happen.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test]]></content:encoded>

The expansion will once again have three different versions--Base, Heroic, and Epic--and each one will grant housing early access.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when that early-access period will start, the bundles don't say, but Blizzard is also continuing the controversial practice of selling a three-day head start to the expansion itself for those who purchase the $90 Epic Edition of the expansion. Blizzard first offered a three-day early-access period with The War Within, WoW's current expansion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4544921-1233557.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544921" data-ratio="0.98605577689243" data-width="1004" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4544921-1233557.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544921"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW: Midnight's leaked preorder bundles (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4544921-1233557.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Epic Edition additionally includes beta access and a number of exclusive cosmetics, including a Midnight Housing Bundle with light- and void-themed housing decorations. It's unclear if players will be able to earn these decorations or variations of them through gameplay, or if purchasing them is the only way to earn them.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not yet commented on the leaked preorder bundles and we still don't know exactly when Midnight will release. At BlizzCon 2023, Warcraft executive producer Chris Metzen said Blizzard is looking to release new WoW expansions on a faster schedule than the MMORPG's usual two-year cycle. Midnight seems to be lining up with that approach, and could possibly release early next year, though that is still speculation.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> infamously flopped upon its arrival way back in 2019, and at the start of next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-anthem-shutting-down-entirely-will-be-unplayable-starting-next-year/1100-6532956/">it will no longer be playable</a>. Now, in a lengthy YouTube video, former BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah has spoken about how the game came to be, and how it got its shaky start. He explained that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/" data-ref-id="5000-25502">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson was not only pitching a new game, but a fresh vision for BioWare.</p><p>"What Casey is pitching to EA is BioWare as a new thing," Darrah said. "It’s BioWare as a new thing. It's BioWare doing storytelling but doing it in a live service, always online, brand-new business model, brand-new way of thinking about the way we tell storytelling."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9_QY8F8z_4c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to Darrah, a lot of what Hudson initially conceived didn't really make it into the end result, but it's "why Anthem was able to generate this much momentum within the organization, because what Casey was essentially pitching was, 'What if it's a BioWare game but it could do FIFA numbers?'"</p><p dir="ltr">The former executive producer even went as far as saying that Hudson and his team weren't just pitching a game, but a new BioWare. He spoke of a video he believes was "intended to be shown to executives," that was "very much presented in, if you imagine the typical early vision video from a slick tech company, it’s very much like that video."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah continued, "In this video, however, it talks about how a lot of what BioWare has done in the past is old-fashioned and its time has come and gone and that BioWare needs to change and BioWare needs to be something different for what I believe to be the originally intended audience. This is exactly what they want to hear. Executives want to hear that BioWare believes that it needs to change, that BioWare needs to be something different. This is what they wanted to hear in this time period."</p><p dir="ltr">Anthem was being pitched as a game that could continuously bring in revenue at a time when live-service games were gaining steam, but ultimately, it struggled to come together. Hudson himself left BioWare during development, something Darrah noted as a big reason why the game struggled to find an identity.</p><p dir="ltr">Hudson pitched it as "the future of storytelling", but no one still at the studio when he left really understood what that meant. "It’s not even clear if Casey knew what that means," Darrah said. "But even if he did, he’s not around to clarify that statement, to be involved in the process of discovering what that actually means."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah also said that he would often argue in favour of delaying Anthem to give it more time, even suggesting that Dragon Age 4 should be released first. This obviously didn't happen, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> only releasing last year.</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah's video doesn't answer every question about why Anthem went wrong, and his perspective is only one side of it, but he did share his intention to make more videos detailing the game's production in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver have announced that upcoming sci-fi action FPS Metal Eden has a new release date, and will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>Metal Eden was initially set to arrive earlier this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">May 6, 2025</a>, with a demo even being made available a little less than a month ahead of that May release date. A little more than a week after the demo went live, however, the game was delayed, with a new release window set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/">sometime during summer 2025</a>. </p>



<p>According to Reikon Games, the delay was meant to give the studio time to respond to feedback it had received from players who checked out the demo, as it said at the time that it "<em>saw some clear areas where we can improve</em>."</p>



<p>Now, it seems like Reikon is confident that it has fixed many of the issues players were noting with the demo, and that Metal Eden is ready for prime-time in less than a month from the time of this writing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I checked out the Metal Eden demo as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">June's Steam Next Fest</a>, and at a time where there are hundreds of demos made available for players to try, recommended it as one of the demos to play before the Next Fest has ended due to the fast-paced action that reminded me of Ghostrunner but with more of a ranged-combat focus compared to Ghostrunner's melee combat.</p>

            <p>Stardock and Oxide Games have announced Ashes Of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/singularity">Singularity</a> II - or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ashes-of-the-singularity-2">Ashes Of The Singularity 2</a>, as people who hate unnecessary extra keyboard presses may prefer - sequel to the sci-fi real-time strategy game Brendy called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-review">"gorgeous, but plain"</a>, adding "there's nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better". The new RTS aims to improve that verdict by introducing: humans. It's a bold strategy, Cotton, but perhaps it'll work out for them.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, in the first game, the number one request was to have a human faction," observes Stardock CEO and sometime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Wardell">Gamergator</a> Brad Wardell in the announcement release. "Back then, we just couldn't support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines." The battling bipeds will join the returning robot and bionic post-human factions in continent-sized scrums encompassing thousands of units. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game will release in 2026, a decade after the first game, and in a show of pure commercial poetry, its story also takes place a decade after the events of the first. Remember to cite this next time somebody tells you that games can't be art.</p>
<p>The new chapter puts you in charge of the United Earth Forces, "a powerful human alliance forged between NATO, China, and Russia, determined to reclaim Earth's territories - including Australia and Africa - as well as vital outposts on planets and moons across the solar system, all previously overtaken by relentless AI and formidable Post-Humans." We'll prise the Sydney Opera House from their stinking cyborg fingers, and paint the surface of Pluto with those quarrelsome brains-in-jars.</p>
<p>Ashes Of The Singularity 2 is the work of a "significantly expanded" dev team, and will feature co-operative and competitive multiplayer together with a skirmish mode. There's a lot more backstory on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intense%20skirmishes%20against%20intelligent%20computer%20opponents">Steam page</a>, together with the announcement that "this is a game that celebrates your strategic skills and rewards you for understanding that logistics, planning and terrain matter." Total Annihilation diehards rejoice, possibly. "We're determined to make the BIG both simple and fun," adds <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3499790/view/547868787733430463?l=english">a dev diary</a> that delves just a little deeper into the base-building aspect.</p>
<p>After being kicked around by Brendy, the original Ashes fell afoul of Fraser Brown (RPS in PCGamer). In a feature about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/learning-to-love-imbalance-in-strategy-games">learning to love imbalance in strategy games</a>, he noted that "its bland campaign reveals its focus: it serves only to get people into the multiplayer component." Did you play the multiplayer? I have to confess, this game passed me by.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-humans-are-revolting-in-ashes-of-the-singularity-2-the-latest-planet-scale-rts-from-oxide-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i><span>Spider-Man: Brand New Day </span></i><span>just started filming this month in Glasgow. Marvel’s team turned the Scottish city </span><a href="https://x.com/Clyde1News/status/1951237551877996843"><span>into a stand-in for NYC</span></a><span> so Tom Holland could swing around and do sick flips while wearing a new red-and-blue suit. Over the weekend, Marvel and Sony released a teaser video of Holland in the new suit, and it’s giving “back to basics.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Tom Holland New Suit Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vsn7sVxCq1M?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>At a glance, that probably doesn’t seem like a big deal. He’s wearing a Spider-Man suit that looks like plenty of others. If you’ve been around Marvel fans long enough, however, you’ll find that people have very strong opinions on costuming, especially as the MCU movies have become so reliant on CG that some actors </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhkdYGJF4k0/"><span>will play out scenes in motion-tracking tech suits</span></a><span> instead of what you’ll eventually see them wearing on screen. Spider-Man has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spiderman-2-peter-parker-best-suits-playstation-5-1850950369"><span>so many different looks</span></a><span> across comics, movies, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><span>video games</span></a><span>, and television shows that fans of the web slinger love to argue about the most minute details in each appearance. Now, there are a lot of set pictures and videos being taken by passersby in Glasgow that show Holland and his stunt doubles swinging around in the full suit, and they’re making even those who doubted the suit believers.</span></p> <p><span>As some viewers have pointed out in the trailer’s comments section, Holland’s suit looks like an homage to those worn by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the previous Spider-Man actors who both appear in </span><i><span>No Way Home</span></i><span> back in 2021. The raised webbing is a big part of what made those suits distinctive, but that’s not the only element of the design that seems to draw from the outfits of prior Peters. The spider symbol is much larger than it was on the Tony Stark-developed suits Holland’s Peter has worn throughout his movies, but also looks more practically made rather than leaning into the high-tech maximalism of some of the later suits in </span><i><span>Infinity War</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>No Way Home</span></i><span>. Since </span><i><span>No Way Home </span></i><span>ended with Peter losing his connection to the rest of the MCU via Doctor Strange making the world forget him, he has to go back to making his own suits rather than relying on Stark tech. His making something that pays tribute to the Spider-Men who helped him save the world, while also going to something homemade, is a nice touch.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of that is cool from a character design standpoint, but it’s also really nice to see Peter wearing something vibrant and comic-accurate. That has caught a lot of fans’ attention, as the set photos and videos that are sprouting up online show that the suit looks great in motion as Holland swings through Fake New York.

<p>You can grab DayZ for free as part of Sony’s PlayStation Plus Monthly Games scheme for August 2025. The promotion has seen a huge surge in players and given Bohemia Interactive cause for celebration.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-new-in-dayz-1-72-heres-the-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DayZ</a> is still popular on multiple platforms all these years later. Its 2019 launch on PS4 and Xbox One gave the MMO multiple platforms to scare the pants off players on. By being a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-headlines-augusts-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS Plus game in August 2025</a>, newbies are getting to find out what the fuss is all about.</p>

<p>The DayZ <a href="https://x.com/DayZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page reports that “DayZ has been claimed by 1.3 million new players through PlayStation Plus monthly games.” This doesn’t mean everyone is playing it, but over one million game libraries are now infected with DayZ fever.</p>



<p>Continuing: “On Day 1 alone, over 300,000 freshies arrived in Chernarus and Livonia.” </p>



<p>This means nearly a quarter of the people who downloaded DayZ hopped into the game straightaway. Combine this figure with all platforms, and it had over 650,000 players at once.</p>



<p>The sudden influx of players did cause some significant stress on the game’s servers. Despite adding over 300 new servers, the post had to apologize for server issues.</p>



<p>Still, this is a great accomplishment, and many more will likely find the drive to survive.</p>



<div><article><p><span>📢Good news, survivors!
DayZ has been claimed by 1.3 million new players through PlayStation Plus monthly games. On Day 1 alone, over 300,000 freshies arrived in Chernarus and Livonia.
We hope you’ve already met some friendly survivors out there.

To those who experienced server </span></p></article></div>

"The real cash cow is GTA Online and its recurring revenues, so limiting GTA VI's total addressable audience at launch to make a quick buck wouldn't be smart. Let's also not forget there's a cost-of-living crisis happening globally," he said.</p>

      </div>
<p>Elliott also mentioned that Rockstar will need to find a way to convince GTA 5 players to move from that game to GTA 6, and keeping the standard edition's price point relatively low could be part of the plan. "A higher floor for the switching cost would limit the GTA 5-to-GTA 6 player acquisition," Elliott said. "Players not budging from GTA 5 is probably one of GTA VI's biggest threats--one GTA hasn't really faced before."</p><p>Beyond these reasons, Elliott said Rockstar can always release a premium version of GTA 6 for $100 or more that includes bonuses like early access or GTA Online currency. "Players with the disposable income to pay that will pay it. It's the best of both worlds, and it's the norm for AAA games these days."</p><p>Elliott said Rockstar could charge $100 for GTA 6's base edition if it wanted to because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">data shows that people are ready and willing to pay extra for a game they really want. </a> However, Elliott said Rockstar may not "charge more than it needs to," and ultimately, Elliott believes Rockstar will settle on $80.</p><p>Elliott shared these thoughts after Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Telegraph</a> that he expects GTA 6 to cost $100 for the base edition.</p><p>Take-Two will release its next earnings report and take questions for analysts on August 7, at which time the company may share more about its plans for GTA 6. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>After a delay, GTA 6 is now set for release on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Indie World Showcase Hopes" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71310d8c49aa3/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-hopes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is going absolutely crazy as tomorrow, 7th August 2025, we're getting our second video game showcase for the Switch 2 and Switch. And it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/surprise-nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-thursday-7th-august-2025">an Indie World</a>.</p>
<p>Indie World showcases are always a nice surprise, and given that this is the first for the Switch 2 gen, we might well be seeing a little more Mouse Mode in action — or, quite literally, <em>mice</em>.</p>
<p>The showcase is around 15 minutes long — a little longer over in Japan — so we've cobbled together and picked one game each (well, for the most part) that we've love to see pop up tomorrow. Some we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-partner-direct-predictions-what-do-you-expect-to-see">Partner Showcase piece</a> last week, but we've also left a few of those out for a little variety.</p>
<p>Well, let's not waste any more time; let us know what you want to see in the comments, but make sure you read through our hopes and dreams below...</p>

<h2>Mass farmicide (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Grave Seasons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f33926df7d1b5/grave-seasons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Blumhouse Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had to really dig deep to come up with something for this, because let's be honest, predicting an Indie World is often a fruitless endeavour. That said, I'm really keen to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grave_seasons">Grave Seasons</a>, the upcoming farming sim with a serial killer twist from developer Perfect Garbage.</p>
<p>Is it an indie game when it's being propped up by a titan like Blumhouse? Eh, I don't know man, I'm just looking forward to it. It's not due until 2026, so it's likely we'd only get a fresh look at some gameplay at the most, but that's enough for me.</p>
<p>I really need something to inject some life into the dreadfully overcrowded sim genre, and this looks like it might just do that.</p>
<h2>Solid Gold, man (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="The Eternal Life of Goldman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee9d126adbfc0/the-eternal-life-of-goldman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: THQ Nordic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm a sucker for T2, but honestly I'm happy to just wait and see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2: No Fate</a> arrive fully formed at the end of October.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/eternal_life_of_goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> is the one I'm keen to hear more about, though. It's tough these days to stand out in the indie crowd when there's a parade of lovely-looking trailers coming one after another after another. Great-looking art alone simply doesn't cut it when there's just so much out there - which made Weappy Studio's platformer all the more impressive for catching my attention <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/round-up-every-nintendo-reveal-and-more-at-thq-nordics-2024-showcase#the-eternal-life-of-goldman-tbd">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully the game's other elements — specifically its mechanics and narrative — can match the quality of the stellar animation.</p>
<h2>You've got mail! (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Tanuki: Pon's Summer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/614129286bbe0/tanuki-pons-summer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Critical Reflex</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few obvious picks I could easily cram in here since the indie and small developer scene continues to awe me. But I want to use this spot to highlight something we haven’t talked much about at NL: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tanuki_pons_summer">Tanuki: Pon’s Summer</a>.</p>
<p>You’re Pon, a tanuki who delivers mail on a BMX. His boss thinks he’s lazy, but really, Pon just wants to do tricks and flips all the time. You get to make friends, play baseball, and rebuild a shrine, among other things. It’s got lots of typical “cosy” elements, but you’re also a really cool little racoon dog doing sick tricks in the air, and there’s a healthy dose of chaos involved.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218570/TANUKI_Pons_Summer/">demo on Steam</a> is absolutely delightful, and it’s been getting a ton of buzz in the showcase scene, so I <em>really</em> hope this gets a chance to shine at a Nintendo showcase.</p>
<h2>Anything is good, as long as it's not Silksong (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a50f0a2a3c77/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, I'm fairly easy when it comes to this Indie Direct, to be honest, I love to dive into unexpected indie delights headlong... just as long as we don't get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>. That's my only hope.</p>
<p>Yes, if you're out there, Team Cherry, if you're seeing this, we definitely DO NOT want to see the game that we are all dying to play suddenly stealth drop during the broadcast. No thanks. Anything but Silksong. No release date, no new trailer, no stealth dro...</p>
<p>OK. Listen. I see what you're playing at. Ice cold mode. Gloves off, then. Just give us the game and nobody gets hurt. What do you want from me?</p>
<p>Oh, and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> news would be good.</p>

<p>So many games that I'd <em>like</em> to see, but I'm going to ring the bell for Yacht Club's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Mina The Hollower</a> again because it looks so very up my street and I've waited for long enough. Now yes, we're still technically waiting on console confirmation, but there's no way that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> devs let a game that <em>so clearly</em> takes inspiration from <strong>Zelda</strong> miss out on a Nintendo release.</p>
<p>The PC launch is set for 31st October (spooky), and my fingers are crossed that we Switch Heads are treated to the same.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Guitar Hero and DJ Hero developers, and the creators of the new line of <a href="https://crkd.gg/">CRKD</a> guitars have come together to form <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/">RedOctane Games</a>, a new rhythm game-focused studio that has just entered full production of its debut title, which is set to be revealed later in 2025.</p>



<p>If the RedOctane name sounds familiar to you, that's because RedOctane Inc. was the studio who teamed up with Harmonix to create and publish the first Guitar Hero game back in 2005. It also worked on Guitar Hero II with Harmonix before it was acquired by <a href="https://archive.ph/20120905022821/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/activision-paid-100-mln-redoctane">Activision in 2006</a>, and then under the Activision banner, made Guitar Hero III and Guitar Hero World Tour alongside Neversoft. However, like many other studios under Activision, RedOctane Inc. was caught up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-12-activision-shuts-down-redoctane-underground-development.html">in a round of layoffs in 2010</a>, with the whole studio being shut down and laid off.</p>



<p>Now, RedOctane Inc. is reborn in the form of RedOctane Games, headed up by Simon Ebejer, who worked on the Guitar Hero series since Guitar Hero III as part of Neversoft, and most recently worked on Diablo IV as the vice president of operations on the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Brothers Charles Huang and Kai Huang, who originally founded RedOctane Inc. in 1999, are still part of the RedOctane journey, and confirmed to be members of RedOctane Games' special advisory board.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond Ebejer and the Huang brothers, a press release for the announcement states that the studio is made up of veteran talent who worked on the games that RedOctane was known for nearly two decades ago, and "<em>proven emerging development talent and community leaders from across today's rhythm gaming space</em>." And while the team's first title is set to be revealed later this year, the studio is currently working on "<em>a range of innovative rhythm-based experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay, they're about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other,</em>" Ebejer said in the press release. "<em>RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions</em>."</p>



<p>The press release also continues to say that RedOctane Games "<em>is ready to deliver the next evolution in rhythm gaming</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This game won’t be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband. This is something new," </em>a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1">blog post</a> on the studio's website from Lee Guinchard reads. "<em>A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what RedOctane Games has in the works. Rhythm games are still a significant part of the video game industry, even if they're not taking over living rooms with multiple plastic instruments anymore. Hopefully, we're not waiting too much longer into the rest of 2025 to see what RedOctane Games' debut title is.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/blackbird-mmorpg-leaks-gta-dan-houser-eso-free-2000615981</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sometimes-the-coolest-sounding-games-are-the-ones-we%E2%80%99ll-never-get.1263480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser finally has a publisher for his first project since <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. A game banned from Steam amid the NSFW censorship crackdown goes free-to-download. And Microsoft’s canceled “<em>Blade Runner</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>” MMORPG <em>Blackbird</em> continues to sound really cool in fresh leaks. Welcome to <em>Kotaku</em>‘s latest Morning Checkpoint, a daily rundown of what’s going on in gaming and beyond, like what James Gunn’s Superman would have looked like <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/superman-trunks-costume-james-gunn-resisted-david-corenswent-pitch-1236252273/">without red underpants</a>. I think he made <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1952851885490356613">the right choice</a>.</p> <h2>More details on Microsoft’s canceled MMORPG <em>Blackbird</em> leak</h2> <p>A recent <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">report from True Achievements</a> shares apparent plot details from <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629">the ill-fated ZeniMax Online project</a>. Its setting included a planet divided between fire and ice, a floating mega city controlled by AI, and various alien factions vying for power. The game would kick off with players investigating a high-profile murder, embarking on missions that would net them more powerful gear, and dealing with firefights that would erupt between the various groups. It all sounds very neat, making the project’s cancelation all the more unfortunate. Of course, it’s easy to take the most broad contours of an unreleased game and transform them into something amazing in your head, when the actual game, had it survived development and actually shipped, might have been anything but. At least with ZeniMax’s unannounced looter shooter, however, Microsoft executives <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives">were apparently also very impressed</a>.</p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> briefly goes free-to-play</h2> <p>The Bethesda MMORPG will let folks dive in without paying as part of QuakeCon 2025 which starts August 7. <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68521">The deal runs through August 12</a>, which should be plenty of time to get through the tutorial section and find out if you dig <em>ESO</em> or not. Released back in 2014, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-elden-ring-nightreign-1851786793">blowing up on Xbox again recently</a> thanks in part to the arrival of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year. If you’re desperate for more <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,<em> ESO</em> is your best bet right now. <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in active development but probably still a couple of years away.</p>

 <h2>The post-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> Absurdaverse draws one step closer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-games-gta-6-what-is-dan-houser-nexts-game-1851058701">Ex-Rockstar creative Dan Houser</a> and Korean publisher Smilegate announced a partnership on Wednesday to ship Absurd Ventures’ “upcoming AAA, open-world, sci-fi action-adventure game” set in the “mind-bending A Better Paradise” universe. What does any of that even mean? Time will tell. Houser is crafting the story alongside fellow <em>GTA</em> veterans Lazlow Jones and Michael Unsworth, with a studio helmed by ex-Niantic and Pandemic Studios boss Greg Borrud. For a taste of what any of this might be building toward, you can check out Houser’s 2024 audio book series <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/book"><em>A Better Paradise Volume 1: An Aftermath</em></a>.</p> <h2><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> comes to console</h2> <p>Strange Scaffold’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-tactical-takedown-review-impressions-steam-tactics-1851782184">fun turn-based tactical riff</a> on<em> TMNT</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0prD_mVl45g">revealed</a> it’s coming to Xbox and Nintendo Switch on August 14.</p> <h2>The <em>Hell Is Us</em> Demo arrives on August 12</h2> <p>Don’t sleep on this upcoming horror action game led by the<em> Deus Ex</em> art director. Preview buzz back in May <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LRDO-y9mNI">was surprisingly positive</a>. It’ll be free to try later this month on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p> <h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em> returns from Steam censorship as a free download</h2> <p>The horror game about uncovering toxic online relationships by combing through someone’s computer files <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">was swept up in the payment processor NSFW game crackdown late last month</a>.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil/">Resident Evil</a> games may be full of terrifying monsters, but none might be as persistent or relentless as Duolingo's mascot, Duo the green owl. As he constantly reminds users to complete their language lessons, almost haunting them, the official <a href="https://x.com/REBHPortal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil Portal</a> account posted a crossover nobody expected. </p><p>"Our new biological weapon.

Duolingo Japan responded with an edit of its own, placing Duo in the role of the T-00 Tyrant (Mr. X) from Resident Evil 2. Given Mr. X's reputation for relentlessly chasing players, fans then understood the assignment. </p><p>The fun continued when Resident Evil Portal posted the popular "English or Spanish" meme, asking fans which language Leon Kennedy is studying. Fans pointed to Resident Evil 4, where Leon travels to Spain, and agreed he must be learning Spanish. The Portal account followed up with an image of Leon practicing <a href="https://x.com/REBHPortal/status/1951961277770932250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">basic Spanish on his phone</a>, as he desperately tried to communicate with hostile villagers from the opening scene. </p><p>The latest reply from Duolingo Japan featured another buff version of Duo, now wearing Mr. X's signature fedora. He warned that he'll chase fans until they can play Resident Evil in English. Fans joined the joke by posting their app progress, which Duo approved. Some are even joking that this is why Leon is missing from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">Resident Evil Requiem</a>--because he's still trapped in a never-ending Spanish lesson. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Original&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>publisher RedOctane has been revived, and the new version of the studio is apparently already hard at work on a brand new rhythm game.</p>

<p>As revealed on the studio's <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the new version of RedOctane will be helmed by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on a number of&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>titles while employed at <em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&nbsp;</em>developer Neversoft.</p>

<p>The announcement also says that the newly-revived RedOctane "includes creators and developers who helped create and scale&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>DJ Hero&nbsp;</em>nearly two decades ago", and that newer developers and creatives from the rhythm gaming space are also joining the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guitar-hero-redoctane-multiplayer.jpg?itok=HA11ll9o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guitar-hero-redoctane-multiplayer.jpg?itok=TnPCjfFM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>RedOctane oversaw the creation of the&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>franchise in its original form.</figcaption></figure><p>Charles and Kai Huang, the brothers who originally started RedOctane back in the 2000s, will "join a special advisory board" for the revived iteration of the studio, which will bring "deep heritage and insight" into RedOctane's "future direction".</p>

<p>Ebejer says that RedOctane is currently working to deliver "the next evolution in rhythm gaming". In an accompanying <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, RedOctane's Lee Guinchard says the project "won't be&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero</em>,&nbsp;<em>DJ Hero</em>,&nbsp;<em>Guitar Freaks</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>", but "something new".</p>

<p>Guinchard, along with several other staffers joining the ranks of the new RedOctane, is part of the <a href="https://crkd.gg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CRKD team</a>, a studio that creates modern rhythm game peripherals for old-school&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clone Hero</em>.</p>

<p>It's not entirely clear whether RedOctane's new game will utilize one of these peripherals (or, indeed, whether it'll come with an entirely new piece of hardware), but given Guinchard and company's expertise, it would seem odd if that wasn't the case.</p>

He joined in 2018.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo recently made the unexpected decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">increase the prices of its last-gen Switch hardware</a> due to “market conditions,” adding $30 to the cost of the $199.99 Switch Lite, $40 to the standard $299.99 Switch, and $50 to the $349.99 Switch OLED. The price difference between the Switch OLED and the standalone Switch 2 now stands at a mere $50. But we found a deal that’s worth checking out for those who don’t want to spend anywhere near $400 for a Switch OLED.</p><p>Woot is still offering the <strong>Switch OLED that comes with white Joy-Con controllers and a free download code for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></strong>, which is one of the console’s best games. You’ll pay just $289.99 at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle-international-model-2" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>, which was already a good deal at the OLED’s original $349.99 price, let alone compared to its new, inflated price. This deal is available for the next four days, or until supply runs dry.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->290</span></p><div><p>The Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle includes a digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p></div></div><p>While the Switch 2 is currently getting all of the attention, the Switch OLED remains a great choice due to its vast game library full of modern classics. Some of its games may run better on the Switch 2, but you’ll still get the same experience overall on the last-gen console. In fact, the Switch OLED’s screen is superior in some ways to what’s offered in the newer hardware.</p><p>Looking past the facts that it’s a smaller 720p screen and locked to 60Hz refresh rate, the OLED panel knocks the socks off the Switch 2’s LCD when it comes to color accuracy, contrast, and brightness control. Since there’s an abundance of vibrant games available for the console, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, to name a couple, the Switch OLED’s screen will likely impress whoever’s playing on it.</p><p>Something to note: The discounted Switch OLED model is the “International version,” and the biggest difference between this and something you can get at Walmart or Target is that it has a 90-day warranty through Woot. If you can look past that, it includes a power adapter for US outlets, and the console itself is region-free, meaning that games from any region will play as intended.</p><div><p id="other-deals-you-might-like"><h2>Other deals you might like</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>This month’s <strong>Humble Choice lineup for PC gamers</strong> is worth the price of admission. <a rel="sponsored" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/482924/2091208/25796?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership">$14.99</a> is all that it costs to get Steam codes for <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, cozy game <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, <em>Lil Gator Game</em>, and more.

Its usual $1,399.99 price isn’t too much to ask, given that it has a 3K 120Hz OLED screen, AMD’s fast Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an <em>enormous </em>trackpad.

Something unexpected about this laptop is that its integrated graphics are more capable than we expected. It can run games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at above 60 frames per second with some settings turned down.</span></li><li><span>If you’re a fan of Studio Ghibli films (how could you not be?), some of them are available on <strong>Blu-ray in gorgeous Steelbook editions</strong> starting at $16.29 at Amazon — a 40 percent discount off their usual $26.99 list price.
