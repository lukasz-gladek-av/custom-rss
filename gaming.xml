<p>It's tennis, again, but with a Fever Racket gimmick that gives the whole thing a fun party twist. With a 38-character roster — the biggest in series history to date, no less — and 30 different rackets to try out, there's an impressive amount of variety on display here, and we can see it cropping up at its fair share of game nights down the line.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the wonderful PJ O'Reilly thought. "The adventure mode is a letdown, and solo players don't have a ton of options," he wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">our review</a>, "but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come".</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932inyhrl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>We'd wager that a fair few of you lovely lot have been getting to grips with Mario Tennis Fever over the past few days, so we thought it only fair to throw this review open to a doubles match and let you have your say about the game, too.</p>
<p>You can share your Fever review score by filling out the poll below. And don't worry if you're mid-rally and not set on a definitive ranking at the moment, you can leave a score now and then come back to change it down the line, if you'd like!</p>

            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a>? I acknowledge that this might come across as a tad mean, but in this ridiculously fast-paced world we find in, it can genuinely be hard to remember one failed live service game from the next. For a refresher, this was Ubisoft's attempt at a battle royale game back in 2020, though it didn't pan out as it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-battle-royale-hyper-scape-will-shut-down-this-april">shut down only a couple of years later</a>. Well, anyway, it's back! Sort of, not quite, but it might soon, or actually probably eventually, will be thanks to the efforts of a group of people hoping to revive it.
</p>
<p>
Over on Zitter, a user by the name of Fiirce shared a clip playing a very sparsely populated version of the games (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battle-royale-shooter-hyper-scape-gets-fan-revival-project">Eurogamer</a>). The post refers to it as Hyper Scape Revival, though I'm not sure if that'll be the official name of this rebirth. For now, the game is only currently playable singleplayer, and it'll apparently be a while before a multiplayer version is available, with the post noting it could take months or even years. Sorry to say that if you've got any interest in playing it, you'll have to hold out, as it's just being tested privately right now.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
I never played a lick of Hyper Scape myself, primarily because I'm not a shooter guy, but also because aesthetically I found it to be quite dull (and honestly likely a notable factor as to why it didn't really take off). That isn't to say it didn't put an interesting spin on the genre, instead of the classic enclosing circle, different sections of the map would disappear, which certainly makes for some big changes in terms of the spatial experience of it all.
</p>
<p>
I'm also just always enthused by the reclamation of a game like this. Whether Ubisoft will do anything or not is obviously up in the air, but I reckon they're a bit too busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">trying to lay off a bunch of staff</a> (and dealing with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">massive strike</a>).

<p>The Highguard website is experiencing issues and is currently unavailable. </p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s latest shooter, Highguard, has not been experiencing the smoothest launch, with player counts dwindling as the days go by. The developers recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, with “most of the team” affected. Now the website has been affected as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-website-unavailable">Highguard Website Unavailable </h2>



<p>At the time of writing, if you head over to the Highguard <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2023814755904090520" rel="nofollow">Wario64</a> on Twitter), you will see that the site is down and has been for some time. The error pop-up states “SITE UNAVAILABLE. This site is currently unavailable. Please contact <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="76050306061904023615191213021e1f04020f0201195815191b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> for assistance.” No other information was revealed, and the developers have not provided any clarity yet. </p>



<p>Highguard developers recently released a big update for the title, in the hopes of bringing more players to the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-episode-2-adds-ranked-mode-new-heroes-and-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Episode 2 </a>features new heroes, a ranked 3v3 competitive playlist where players can climb through 7 ranks, a new map, and additional quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. However, this addition has not helped bring up the concurrent numbers.</p>



<p>Several factors could have led to Highguard’s failure, including the Game Awards 2025 finale moment, the social media blackout, and more. Interested readers can check out a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full guide</a> on it here. </p>







<p>In other news, a tech artist who worked on Highguard has reflected on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highs and lows of the game’s development and launch</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5v5 Raid Mode</a> has been made permanent.

An updated demo will be playable throughout Steam Next Fest: February 2026 Edition. <span id="more-1027080"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via DIE SOFT:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Inspired by Winsor McCay’s works, <em>Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland</em> transports you into the colorful, hand-animated world of Nemo’s dreams. Once a peaceful place, Slumberland has been besieged by the mysterious Oblivion, which threatens to destroy this precious world and its inhabitants. It is now up to you to push back and stop the Oblivion from spreading, consuming Slumberland and anything within it as it grows.</p><p>While Nemo is sound asleep, you’ll be able to explore the many domains that make up Slumberland, each with its unique characteristics, inhabitants, and collectibles to discover. As you progress, you’ll also meet a unique cast of characters ready to guide you through the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> and work together to prevent Slumberland’s destruction! But beware: this cute dream world is not as safe as it once was. Strange creatures have been emerging from the Oblivion, turning Slumberland from a dream into a dangerous nightmare.</p><p>If you want to save Slumberland, you must be prepared to overcome challenges, defeat increasingly more frightening enemies and face off against nightmarish bosses. As you explore Slumberland, you’ll find Nemo’s favorite Toys, each of which will grant you a new ability to help you avoid hazards, defeat enemies, and even find new pathways through Slumberland! Make sure to keep an eye out for Nemo’s Pajamas, Little Buddies, and other collectibles, which will make your journey through Slumberland a little more fun!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Primarily developed by DIE SOFT founder Dave Mauro, <em>Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland</em> draws heavily from its <a title="Platforms > NES [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/nes">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>-era ancestors. The game’s revamped gameplay is designed with approachability and accessibility in mind, but can also scale up to appeal to more experienced Metroidvania veterans. Commenting on the game approaching its release date, Dave said: “It’s been so exciting to work with a character and setting I’ve always been a bit obsessed with, and I can’t wait for players to finally get to see what I’ve been working on all these years”.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>A lush, hand-animated world, composed of many distinct thematic domains, all seamlessly connected.</li><li>Defeat challenging bosses, discover collectibles, and unlock new abilities to progress.</li><li>An original soundtrack composed entirely by Peter Berkman of Anamanaguchi.</li><li>Tight and responsive controls for retro-inspired platforming <a title="Genres > Action [3,413 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</li><li>Designed with approachable and accessible baseline experience, that can be ranked up for more skilled players.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PC Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Little Nemo - PC Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvCqVL0BOCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/little-nemo-and-the-guardians-of-slumberland-launches-march-31-for-pc-later-in-2026-for-switch]]></content:encoded>

<p>As ever, the event is only available for those with the Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC, and it'll challenge you to complete the roguelike mode with limited perks and upgrades.

			<p>Here's something we weren't really expecting to read: <strong>John Romero</strong>, the man behind some of the greatest old-school first-person shooter games (<strong>Wolfenstein 3D</strong>, <strong>Doom</strong>, <strong>Quake</strong>), revealed that his most-played game of all time is <strong>Blizzard's World of Warcraft</strong>. That's about <strong>as far from the games he's most renowned for as you could imagine</strong>, being an MMORPG with stylized visuals and tab-targeting combat. And yet, Romero himself <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/doom-co-creator-john-romero-adores-ghost-recon-and-has-over-3-000-hours-in-world-of-warcraft-god-i-lived-in-that-game-every-day-for-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told PC Gamer</a> that <strong>he lived in Azeroth for five years</strong>:</p>



<p><em>It's World of Warcraft. I have probably 3,000-plus hours in WoW. God, I lived in that game every day for five years. Six hours usually, every day. And then weekends were as long as I could stay awake. I was making an MMO at the time, and studying that game was really important to me as far as "Why do I want to do this? Why am I putting up with this? What are you thinking about second to second while you're doing this?"</em></p>



<p><em>I was in a raiding guild. You name it, I did so much stuff. I have five main characters with all the gear of different classes. And I had 10 characters total. When you start a new character, you're starting the game from the beginning, but I knew how to optimise burning through. I could get to level six in half an hour.</em></p>



<p><em>It's always important to look at those successful games and the systems that are in them as a battle-tested system. The way that they implemented this has been played by millions of people, and they have kept it for years. It works. That's really important for design to just look at those examples. Not that you would directly copy anything, but that you understand why it was done that way and how it works.</em></p>



<p>The MMORPG John Romero mentioned working on was never revealed, though it was likely during his time at <strong>Slipgate Ironworks</strong>, between <strong>2005</strong> and late <strong>2010</strong>, which fits the five-year timeline and also coincides with <strong>World of Warcraft's heyday</strong>. We only know it was based on an original IP. The game designer is also credited with a Special Thanks for the free-to-play MMO <strong>Marvel Super Hero Squad Online</strong>, which was launched in 2011 by Gazillion Entertainment. </p>



<p>Romero recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-romero-talking-companies-finish-game-funded-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>he's talking with other companies to continue developing his next game</strong> after <strong>Microsoft pulled out as a funder</strong>. He then <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-have-never-played-a-game-like-this-before-doom-creator-john-romero-compares-next-game-to-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that it's a very unique game that will be innovative in a similar way to what <strong>FromSoftware's Elden Ring</strong> did for open world games.</p>



<p>As for World of Warcraft, Blizzard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the roadmap toward the launch of the game's eleventh expansion pack, <strong>Midnight</strong>.</p>

              <p>Clickout Media is a group that buys up gaming sites and then forces them to host endless unmarked advertorial content for gambling sites and casinos. Now the owner of <em>The Escapist</em>, <em>Adventure Gamers</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Esports Insider&nbsp;</em>is, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clickout-media-owner-of-the-escapist-pivots-to-ai-holds-mass-layoffs/">reporting by&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming</em></a>, going to “pivot to AI,” and of course that means firing swathes of staff and demolishing the remains of all the sites it’s ruined.</p> <p>“Sad to say that my role at <em>The Escapist</em> is up for redundancy,” wrote that site’s&nbsp;contributing editor Lloyd Coombes on BlueSky. On LinkedIn he added, “<span><span dir="ltr">that means a lot of things that I’m still not quite getting my head around.” Coombes is just one of many people who are losing their jobs as a result of ClickOut’s ridiculous folly. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reports, “It was said that Clickout Media will be maintaining a skeleton crew of ‘AI Editors.'”</span></span></p>   <p>“That’s me and my team gone from&nbsp;<em>VideoGamer</em>,” says Cat Bussell. “Very sad day. I’ll probably do a bigger post on this later on down the line. Still reeling.”</p>   <p>It seems that all these sites might be completely wiped out with so many job losses, all to be replaced by the illusion of AI.</p>

 <p>ClickOut is a peculiarly shy company, describing itself as a “PR and marketing agency” despite its acquisition of gaming sites, and focus on crypto and web 3. It’s so shy, in fact, that it keeps its company’s name off the sites it buys, and goes out of its way to hide its ownership, as we discovered last year when the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/adventure-gamers-forums-gambling-ads-jack-allin-1851784764">bought the beloved&nbsp;<em>Adventure Gamers</em></a> and reduced it to shilling for online casinos. The site is almost abandoned now, after 27 years of passionate adventure gaming coverage, with the last couple of stories from mid-2025 sitting ghost-like at the top above “reviews” of online slot machines.</p> <p>The same is true on&nbsp;<em>The Escapist</em>, a site that’s been through many iterations from its highbrow beginnings as an online magazine, through its grim pro-GamerGate era, to its most recent form as a solid, well-written gaming news site from people who genuinely care. The staff has demonstrated a special knack for covering lesser-known games among the big hitters, albeit one that is constantly undermined by the enforced inclusion of “guides” for online gambling that all read suspiciously like a robot might have helped. The same is true all over again on <em>Esports Insider</em>, which continues to put out solid journalism about the esports world, in between wildly incongruous articles about stock prices of betting firms. And then there’s the esteemed <em>VideoGamer</em>, which has battled on despite being plagued with casino ad shite.</p>

 <p>It’s not just gaming sites to which ClickOut commits this vandalism.&nbsp;<em>ReadWriteWeb</em> was once a web tech site, launched in 2003 and well-respected, but now it’s just a site pushing sports betting, casinos and poker. It also spent last year <a href="https://pokerindustrypro.com/news/article/222041-cardplayer-pokerscout-pokerstrategy-clickout-finixio">buying many, many poker sites</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.igbaffiliate.com/en/articles/mergers-and-acquisitions/clickout-media-buys-gambling-insider-for-up-to-14-million/"><em>Gambling Insider</em></a>.</p>

 <p>We’re not able to confirm how many people have lost their jobs today, because as&nbsp;<em>Insider Gaming</em> reports, those affected have been required to sign NDAs in order to ensure they receive their severance. We’ve reached out to ClickOut, but based on previous experience, their shyness seems to prevent them from replying to emails, too.</p> <p>We wish all the best to everyone affected, in a continuingly grim era for games journalists.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[We Should Use Social Media The Same Way Manga Authors Write About Their Week]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/weekly-shonen-jump-author-comments-social-media-sucks/</link>
            <guid>1438519</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I’ve long believed that <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitter-elon-musk-grok-antisemitic-mechahitler/"><u>social media is a suck</u></a>, and if I didn’t have to use it for my job, I wouldn’t. If it isn’t showing you long paragraphs of hot garbage cosplaying as Socrates from folks who should know better than to put screenshots of discourse on your timeline, <a href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications/"><u>it’s some other bullshit</u></a>. But what doesn’t suck—and honestly feels downright aspirational—is mangaka author comments, which should be the blueprint for how to use social media.</p><p>Back in the day, when Borders bookstores were still around, you could flip to the inside cover of a manga volume and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/15syrck/those_cute_little_notes_that_manga_authors_do_at/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>read an anecdotal paragraph from creators</u></a>, like<a href="https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/akira-toriyama-tankobon-introductions/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Dragon Ball</em>’s Akira Toriyama</u></a> writing about spoiling his kids and trying not to get bored making manga. While you can still read lengthier ramblings today, like<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/12r1ira/tatsuki_fujimotos_author_comment_from_his_second/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Chainsaw Man</em> creator Tatsuki Fujimoto</u></a> recollecting how he ate his girlfriend’s pet fish instead of telling her he killed it, you can also read what a collective of mangaka has to say about their weeks like a curated, pseudo social media feed.&nbsp;</p><p>In the modern digital age, authors’ comments are still going strong, preserved online in blog posts where Weekly Shonen Jump’s rotating roster of creators drop diary entries with the same energy as NBA players in a post‑game interview—hands on their hips while on the court, still catching their breath, saying whatever stray thought about their week pops into their heads. Shonen Jump’s author comments, stylized as <a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/tagged/1806/author-comments?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mangaka musings</u></a>, are exactly that: a collection of off‑the‑cuff messages from creators published in Weekly Shonen Jump, giving fans a quick peek into their day‑to‑day lives.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Valid. </span><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-07-21-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><span>(Shonen Jump)</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes, author comments are about the chapter they slaved away on in the meat grinder that is weekly manga production, <a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-08-04-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>congratulating a creator for finishing their series</u></a>, or sharing updates about a live-action or anime adaptation. But more often than not, it’s just them posting about random occurrences in their lives and their thoughts about them. Those thoughts can range from <em>One Piece</em> creator Eiichiro Oda praising a <a href="https://aftermath.site/kiss-or-die-netflix-review-comedy-variety-tv-yakuza-like-a-dragon/"><u>very bad variety show</u></a> as “<a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-10-26-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the pinnacle of human achievement</u></a>,” <em>Sakamoto Days</em>’<em> </em>creator updating readers on <a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-11-30-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><u>his progress in <em>Nightreign</em></u></a>, everyone’s obsession with butter caramel Pringles, or the emotional arcs of their procurement and piecemeal <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/2038/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>consumption of choco eggs</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The beauty of the grab-bag randomness of mangaka musings is that they’re oh so brief. They’re unfiltered, shower thoughts-level of relatable, and they paint enough of a picture that you feel better having taken the time to read them. Here are a handful of authors’ comments I like that would go triple platinum as social media posts:</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-11-03-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>(Image: Shonen Jump)</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-11-09-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-02-01-2026?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-21-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-07-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-07-27-2025?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-12-08-2024?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-12-01-2024?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-08-2024?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.viz.com/blog/posts/mangaka-musings-09-08-2024?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Shonen Jump</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, a lot of these comments read like exasperated asides blurted out because they had to write something on top of drawing 21 pages of their ongoing manga for reader enjoyment. But it's that exact “I’m not gonna hold you” brevity that makes them worth checking out every week. Sometimes it’s just nice to see what someone found worth mentioning, no matter how superfluous it is.</p><p>Manga author notes should be the aspiration for how we use social media, because the smallest, most offhand thing is more human than any algorithm-optimized screed rewarding ragebaiting, forced discourse, and low-effort engagement farming sludge we doomscroll past on the daily.

I think that with a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, you'd be well within your right to have an eyebrow pre-raised considering its online, sort of free-to-play (depending on where you live) predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> regarding the like of microtransactions. I know I certainly have! At a glance Crimson Desert certainly looks like it could fall into similar pitfalls if only based on vibes alone. However! Developer Pearl Abyss would quite like you to know that, in that regard at least, you have nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">Dropped Frames show</a> (ta, <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217">Okami13_</a>), marketing director at Pearly Abyss America Will Powers explained, "I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions. It’s a monetisation model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop."
</p>
<p>
This is, admittedly, an annoying thing to have to be thankful for. I sure would like it if games weren't designed to exploit the most exploitable of us! Still, it's something, even if this doesn't totally rule out other bits of, admittedly still annoying but slightly less so, DLC, expansions and the like.
</p>
<p>
Last month, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game got a bit more of a lengthier look-in which quite honestly befuddled me at points. It's obviously very much a medieval fantasy setting, but it's just so realistic looking that the flashy particle effects, literal mechs, and just straight up dragons feel like they don't contrast as well as they potentially might in a more stylised setting. Ah well, at least you only have to pay for it all once!

              <p><span>According to Rémi Verschelde, project manager of Godot Engine and co-founder of the platform’s financial backer W4 Games, the never-ending wave of “AI slop” pull requests on Godot’s GitHub is becoming “increasingly draining and demoralizing” for its maintainers, to the point that over 4,600 pull requests are currently open on the engine’s GitHub page.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-co-founder-says-ai-slop-pull-requests-have-become-overwhelming"><i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, Verschelde’s comment on Bluesky was made in response to a post by Adriaan de Jongh, the developer and publisher of the 2017 indie puzzle hit </span><i><span>Hidden Folks</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adriaan.games/post/3mexoxyaui22x"><span>which stated</span></a><span> that Godot’s GitHub has been overrun with countless undisclosed AI-generated pull requests. “Changes often make no sense, descriptions are extremely verbose, users don’t understand their own changes…It’s a total shitshow.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/app.bsky.feed.post/3meyerixvhs2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifnwjboai3ml34oyyl7f2o3d7dtktxqmqrbt5hepzzs4xebfw2qea"> <p lang="en">Honestly, AI slop PRs are becoming increasingly draining and demoralizing for #Godot maintainers.</p> <p>If you want to help, more funding so we can pay more maintainers to deal with the slop (on top of everything we do already) is the only viable solution I can think of:</p> <p>fund.godotengine.org</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz?ref_src=embed">Rémi Verschelde (@akien.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/post/3meyerixvhs2p?ref_src=embed">2026-02-16T15:33:57.699Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyerixvhs2p"><span>In reply</span></a><span>, Verschelde noted that the problem has become such an issue that Godot’s GitHub maintainers are being forced to “second guess every [pull request] from new contributors, multiple times per day.” Although he stated that Godot prides itself on “being welcoming to new contributors,” Verschelde also doesn’t see a way out of the situation, beyond further donations to help pay more maintainers. “Maintainers spend a lot of time assisting new contributors to help them get PRs in a mergeable state. I don’t know how long we can keep it up.”</span></p>

 <p><span>A cursory glance at the </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"><span>closed pull requests</span></a><span> on Godot’s GitHub page proves that this isn’t an exaggeration, as dozens of pull requests have been denied or reported as spam by Godot’s maintainers within the past month alone, with comments left by maintainers pointing out AI-written code appearing on a daily basis. Godot has been used to ship a bunch of hit indie games over the last few years like <em>Brotato</em> and <em>Until Then</em> and is a valuable alternative to proprietary game engines like Unity, which have been <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-promises-deluge-of-new-games-prompted-into-existence-by-ai-as-its-stock-tanks-2000669483">rolling out their own genAI tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Verschelde stated that paying more maintainers would be the simplest option, he also stated that Godot may have to raise “the barrier to entry” for its contributors instead. When quizzed about the possibility of automating the process, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyf4t77ds2p"><span>he replied</span></a><span> that it “seems horribly ironic to have to run an AI on our CI to detect AI slop.” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3mextjgn2g22i"><span>Chet Faliszek</span></a><span>, writer for several Valve titles including </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Portal 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Half-Life 2: Episode One</span></i><span>, believes that the onus to fix the system should be on GitHub instead. “Really is just exhausting to watch all this playout and github promoting this, not fighting it.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Disney and Lucasfilm released the latest trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, the first new <em>Star Wars</em> movie since <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> hit theaters back in 2019, and it includes everything I want from a movie set in this famous galaxy: eierd aliens, sci-fi action, deep cut references, and a voice cameo from famed director Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>The upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> flick stars Pedro Pascal as fan-favorite bounty hunter Din Djarin alongside his faithful little buddy Grogu, aka Baby Yoda. Set after the events of the original trilogy and the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series, this new movie, which hits theaters on May 22, is set to tie up plot threads involving the remnants of the Empire trying to destroy the New Republic. It will also likely provide more answers about Grogu, a member of Yoda’s species. Here’s the trailer:</p>

   <p>And yes, that shopkeeper alien we see at the start who gets spooked when asked to provide information about a Hutt is voiced by the one and only Martin Scorsese, the director behind films like <em>Goodfellas</em> and <em>The Wolf of Wall Street.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/martin-scorsese-joinins-star-wars-universe/">Disney confirmed as much with <em>Polygon</em></a>. I can’t wait to see how angry online commenters who can’t stop yelling about the famous director’s MCU comments will react to him appearing in what looks to be a big, dumb, super-expensive <em>Star Wars</em> summer blockbuster.</p> <p>As for the rest of the trailer, I’m super into all the weird, goofy aliens and monsters that appear in it. The fact that a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mantellian_Savrip">Mantellian Savrip</a> shows up at the very end of the trailer as the big monster alien Mando and Grogu fight in the city made me giggle a little, I have to admit. This is an alien that first appeared as one of the holochess pieces in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> movie. Cool to see it here in the flesh. <a href="https://x.com/sw_holocron/status/2023761695026577621">Meanwhile, seeing Embo</a>, a bounty hunter from the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series, pop up was fun, as was seeing Zeb from <em>Rebels</em> show up again after first appearing in live action back in the original <em>Mando</em> show on Disney+.</p>

 <p>Will all these silly cameos and references be enough in and of themselves to make<em> Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> a good movie? Nope. But at least this thing seems like a big movie, and I’m happy about that. <em>Star Wars</em> belongs in theaters, even when it’s bad, and I’m happy that after a few years away, we are finally getting a new cinematic <em>Star Wars</em> adventure. Let’s just hope it’s halfway decent when it arrives in May.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-game-length/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length could stop you from buying the game—don’t lie, it’s because you’re too scared. If you are legitimately concerned about how long Capcom’s latest entry is, this guide should provide clarity.</p>



<p>Previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games have always had a decent length to them, with some being way longer than others. The RE speedruns are legendary, with players mopping up the main story in one brief sitting. If this is putting you off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, let’s take a look at what you can expect.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-resident-evil-requiem">How Many Hours To Beat Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say Grace. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There have been conflicting reports about Resident Evil Requiem’s game length, but based on sources, you should expect around 10-16 hours of main-game content, with completionist save files expected to clock in around 30-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Reports have been circling about the game’s length, but truth be told, no one has an <em>exact </em>bearing on Requiem’s game length yet.</p>



<p>Three voices have managed to give a ballpark region for the game’s runtime: The director, the producer, and long-time leaker Dusk Golem.</p>



<p>Initially, it was suggested by the game’s producer that Requiem would be comparable to Resident Evil 4 in terms of game length. Everyone’s mileage varies, but the fourth main game is up there with one of the longest runtimes for main content. It’s amazing how much extra time is added for having crazy chainsaw people cut Leon’s head off.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-explains-leons-ruthless-anger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Director Talks Leon’s ‘Ruthless Anger’</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This gave everyone hope that Resident Evil 9 would also be a meaty adventure. Since then, the game’s director has come out and said the horror title’s length is hard to gauge. Finally, Dusk Golem—who provided details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-embargo-date/" id="177337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem’s review embargo date</a>—gave information on what they knew:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve heard myself it’s longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Village’s game length (particularly for a first-time playthrough) is around the 10-hour mark. So, even if Requiem finds a healthy middle ground, the first playthrough should be around 12-14 hours, with a wider margin of 10-16 hours capturing everything—not too shabby.</p>



<p>Obviously, the details are more hit and miss than the original Resident Evil’s dialogue. The expected game length mark shouldn’t be too far short if it is.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/3)-The producer claims the game is "roughly" the length of RE:4, though the director stepped in to say that estimating game time is hard, so to just expect a "Resident Evil" amount of content.<br>-Separately, I've heard myself it's longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2020691307052859637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-does-resident-evil-9-compare-to-other-resident-evil-games">How Does Resident Evil 9 Compare To Other Resident Evil Games?</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length sounds like it’s more in keeping with recent Resident Evil games, rather than the earlier entries, which were very short in comparison.</strong></p>



<p>You get indie horror games nowadays that are longer than the original Resident Evil trilogy entries! Resi 4 really advanced the series and gave players a long and winding adventure. It’s been fairly consistent ever since.</p>

</ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HowLongToBeat</a> (which aggregates playthrough from hundreds and thousands of players), here’s the average playtime for every mainline Resident Evil game—and we’re using the remakes where applicable.</p>

<p>WWE 2K26 is bringing plenty of changes to the popular Universe Mode.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the wide variety of changes coming to Universe Mode. The name of the game is control in WWE 2K26, and this year’s Universe Mode provides even more options for players to meticulously manipulate the in-game sandbox while also allowing for set-it-and-forget-it options for those who just want to kick back and watch a simulated Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-re-a-wizard-wwe">You’re a Wizard, WWE</h2>



<p>This year’s WWE Universe Mode features a new Universe Wizard that lets players choose which weekly shows and PLEs to feature, assign Superstars to each show and their champions, and set the calendar start month. Players can choose an existing show, such as WWE Monday Night Raw. However, they can also either import a show they downloaded or start from scratch with a brand-new creation.</p>



<p>Players can edit details for default shows like Raw and SmackDown, including rosters, championships, and divisions. Each show supports up to eight titles across men’s and women’s divisions, including tag team and intergender titles, plus two Money in the Bank briefcases.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-more-customization-options-in-universe-mode-for-wwe-2k26">More Customization Options in Universe Mode for WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 expands Universe mode with new match setup options, including enhanced settings and sliders. Players can now adjust matchmaking sliders to fine-tune match card sorting, scoring, and bonuses for title matches, rivalries, and match types. </p>



<p>For those who want to start from scratch, there are settings to remove all default rivalry options and start with a blank canvas.</p>











<p>Promo options are also updated. This year, players have even more control over the outcome of Universe Mode promos. When challenging a rival to a match, the challenger can now directly select the match stipulations. Players can take the direction of their promos in new avenues, including babyface and heel turns.</p>



<p>There are also customization options for wrestlers’ attire for weekly shows, pay-per-view events, and WrestleMania. Once again, allowing even more customization options.</p>

Kennedy in Capcom's hugely anticipated game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem has been pitched by Capcom as a special title in the series — one that returns to the franchise's origins to wrap up long-standing plotlines and feature fan-favorite characters — such as Leon, of course, but also what appears to be Sherry — as part of a much-anticipated return to Raccoon City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, Resident Evil Requiem is believed by some fans to likely be the final time we see or play as some of these characters, as Capcom moves its franchise forward. (Also, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/women-in-particular-were-pretty-strict-when-reviewing-his-design-resident-evil-requiem-director-says-hot-uncle-leon-s-kennedy-has-many-fans-at-capcom">hot uncle Leon</a> is one thing, but hot grandad Leon seems less believable.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which is to say that there's a particular level of concern around Resident Evil Requiem plot leaks — with some fans now saying they will be avoiding social media fully for the foreseeable future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early," wrote noted Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023701578654642421" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dusk Golem</a>, who repeatedly stated that Leon was in the game months before Capcom made it official. "Funnily enough someone I vaguely know &amp; have talked to a few times, no spoilers out there yet but brace yourselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The account then shared a link to an image of a boxed PlayStation 5 copy of Resident Evil Requiem, seemingly out in the wild. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early, funnily enough someone I vaguely know &amp; have talked to a few times, no spoilers out there yet but brave yourselves.<a href="https://t.co/xoDURKOWVw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xoDURKOWVw</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023701578654642421?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, the best advice to avoid spoilers is simply to avoid the internet as much as you can before next week, but particularly to be careful of YouTube and Twitch comments where people spread spoilers in chat.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/valves-steam-deck-intermittently-out-of-stock-as-ram-shortage-drags-on/</link>
            <guid>1438474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this month, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">announced</a> it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.</p>
<p>Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">noting</a> that the device would be “out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” None of Valve’s three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations</a> that Valve sometimes offers.</p>
<p>Valve hasn’t announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck’s de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344310/valve-discontinues-steam-deck-lcd-oled-versions-remain#g344310-2">announced in December</a> that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn’t be restocked once it sold out.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck’s hardware is four years old this month, and faster hardware with better chips and higher-resolution screens have been released in the years since. But those Ryzen Z1 and Z2 chips aren’t always dramatically faster than the Deck’s semi-custom AMD chip; many of those handhelds are also considerably more expensive than the OLED Deck’s $549 starting price. When it’s in stock, the Deck still offers compelling performance and specs for the price.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1438459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, is out on PS5 and PC in a little more than two weeks' time from the time of this writing. Despite it having a rough road to launch, now that we're so close to it, the game looks more impressive than ever, and its new 'Death Awaits' trailer ahead of its <strong>open preview server slam test</strong> next weekend is the latest example of just how solid it looks.</p>



<p>The server slam test will give Bungie the chance to let the servers get pushed to their limit right ahead of launch, as the test will take place from <strong>February 26 to March 2</strong>. Marathon arrives on PC and PS5 three days later, on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on Marathon's journey, how it looks is not the only impressive thing about it; it's also impressive to see the buzz around the game. It was always going to have an uphill battle, coming in as the game that had to shoulder Bungie's future hopes while its marquee franchise, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">Destiny</a></strong>, continued to flounder.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH AWAITS | Marathon Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marathon lost its <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">game director amidst a scandal </a>near the beginning of its production. It's suffered through <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">more than one round of layoffs at Bungie</a>. It had a massive scandal regarding the game's whole artistic foundation and aesthetic being <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">ripped from another artist without permission</a>. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a>, ad even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">believed to be dead</a> by some of its biggest doubters. </p>



<p>Its closed, NDA-protected beta tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-leaked-closed-technical-test-bungie/">kept leaking gameplay like crazy</a>, and the last major public beta test <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/">wasn't as well-received as Bungie would've hoped</a>, even providing a solid sounding board for other games to do better.</p>



<p>Now, though, as we sit days away from launch, even though it's still far too early to say Marathon has the ability to 'save Bungie,' it looks clear that this won't be a flop. Marathon has the chance to start off strong and grow into another strong title in Bungie's portfolio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Will Steam Deck Consoles Be Back In Stock? Out Of Stock Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-out-of-stock-explained/</link>
            <guid>1438450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamers hoping to pick up a Steam Deck in 2026 could face quite a battle, as Valve is among those who have been hit by the widespread RAM issues, leading to stock shortages.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-out-of-stock-alerts-ram-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out-of-stock alerts for Steam Deck models</a> in the United States have caused a stir, with uncertainty about when Steam Decks will be available for purchase again.</p>



<p>If you’ve encountered stock shortages when trying to purchase a Steam Deck, Insider Gaming has all the details on the availability of the console and when it could be available to purchase.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-steam-deck-be-back-in-stock">When Will Steam Deck Be Back in Stock?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited options. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Valve has provided no indication of when Steam Decks will be back available, and it could be a while until the systems are back on the first-hand market.</strong></p>



<p>Like most tech companies, Valve is having to cope with the lack of available RAM, which is also affecting the likes of Nintendo, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-buy-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potentially pushing up the price of the Switch 2</a>. Unfortunately, this is completely out of their hands, and there is no indication that demand will be reduced anytime soon.</p>



<p>Valve’s storefront in the US states that Steam Deck models may be unavailable “intermittently in some regions,” and there’s no indication of when products will be back on the market.</p>



<p>The shortage of RAM is expected to remain a problem throughout 2026 and potentially into 2027, with it expected that it will cause a delay to the release date for next-generation consoles from the likes of Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-steam-deck-lcd-model-be-available-again">Will The Steam Deck LCD Model be Available Again?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Valve will not have the LCD Steam Deck model available again, as the console has been discontinued entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Valve is no longer making the LCD Steam Deck models, which were a cheaper entry point for fans, and will not be restocking the console on its website.</p>



<p>This means that if you’re on the hunt for a Steam Deck LCD Model, the only options available are the second-hand market, which is likely seeing a price increase, too, given the demand for the consoles.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> completely overhauls elements of the Creation Suite, including new additions exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/">WWE 2K Ringside Report</a> features updates to the Creation Suite. It was previously announced that the number of created wrestler slots would increase from 100 to 200. That is twice as many opportunities to create new wrestlers and bring existing non-WWE stars to your roster, either by creating your own versions or by downloading them in Community Creations.</p>



<p>It’s also now known that Create-an-Image slots have doubled. This means there are now 2,000 free slots available to create custom images. You can also find custom images on Community Creations. Nintendo Switch 2 now features the image uploader for the first time. They’ve also added the ability to use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls for greater precision when customizing your wrestler.</p>

<h2 id="h-even-more-customization-options-in-create-a-superstar">Even More Customization Options in Create-a-Superstar</h2>



<p>Additionally, the Create-a-Superstar offers many more direct control options. The layer system has been improved. Previously, there were 60 layers across the entire Custom Superstar. Now, the head and body are in separate sections, while the attire options are drawn from separate pools. In total, there are 60 layers for attire and 40 for head and body. Players can also choose from 40+ body templates as a starting point and further customize the body with morphing tools.</p>



<p>Plus, there are all-new two-tone hair blending options for even more creativity and authenticity.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-not-all-coming-to-creation-in-wwe-2k26">That’s Not All Coming to Creation in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Additional updates to the Creation Suite include a revamped menu for Create-a-Championship and Money in the Bank. This section also includes new available championship parts. </p>



<p>They also added advanced timelines to entrance customizations and the ability to create victory and entrance motions for four-person and five-person stables.</p>

            <p>
Classic arena shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament-2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> has risen from the grave and is now available to download for free, all thanks to a dedicated group of fans working with developer Epic Games' blessing. And the upshot of all this is the much-loved arena FPS has received its first patch "in over 20 years".
</p>

When Unreal Tournament 2004 originally launched, Eurogamer branded it the "mother of all first-person shooters", praising its massive map roster, its 32-player Onslaught mode, and the welcome introduction of vehicles. All that was enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-ut2004-pc">earn it ye olde 9/10</a>, and plenty of other people loved it too. However, support for Unreal Tournament 2004 officially ended in 2022, when Epic terminated its legacy online services and pulled the game - alongside a number of titles - from digital storefronts.
</p>
<p>
But it turns out the end was not the end. Late last year, fan community OldUnreal announced it was working to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 (the group previously resurrected Unreal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> 1999), patch it with bug fixes and quality of life improvements, then release it for free - all with Epic's blessing. And that day has finally arrived, with Unreal Tournament 2004 (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/unreal-tournament-2004-is-now-available-for-free-thanks-to-its-fan-community-and-theyve-even-updated-the-game-for-modern-pcs-this-is-the-first-public-patch-for-unreal-tournament-2004-in-over-20-years/">PC Gamer</a>) available to download right now.
</p>
<p>
By <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/ut2004/full-game-installers/">heading over to the OldUnreal website</a>, interested Windows users can download and run the group's newly released installer. That, in turn, will grab the original Unreal Tournament 2004 disc image from OldUnreal's servers, extract their contents, install the game, and automatically patch it to the latest version. Linux and macOS are <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/FullGameInstallers/releases">pointed toward the group's Github page</a>.
</p><p>
"Please note that this is the first public patch for Unreal Tournament 2004 in over 20 years," project manager (and professor of computer science) Stijn-volckaert writes in the game's <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases">new patch notes</a>. "We have implemented numerous fixes and improvements, written a new SDL backend for Linux and macOS, and even a new renderer. We have also migrated the entire codebase to modern build systems. Some new bugs may have slipped in!"
</p>
<p>
So there you go! The "mother of all first-person shooters" can now be downloaded and played for free - and what better time to start revisiting some video game classics than right now, when AI companies are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">making it increasingly difficult to buy new hardware</a>?

<figure><a title="Super Bomberman Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162067/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most pleasant surprises of this month’s Partner Direct was the reveal and shadow drop of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, a compilation of some of the eponymous hero’s earliest games with some extra goodies thrown in. Though it’s ultimately little more than the sum of its parts, Super Bomberman Collection does a great job of presenting these timeless games in their best possible light. If you’re looking for a great game to play with others for some excellent competitive couch multiplayer, read on.</p>
<p>So, let’s run through what’s included here. The headlining games are <strong>Super Bomberman 1-5</strong> for the SNES, the latter three of which never even saw an official release in the US, while the first two NES Bomberman games and some boss rush modes are included on the side as fun extras. Additionally, there’s some cool museum content on display between an art gallery, music player, and original scans of the boxes and instruction manuals. It's a comprehensive and content-rich package; retro collections like these are increasingly more common these days, but you don’t always see developers going the extra mile to include as much as Konami did here.</p>

<p>Gameplay across all five of the SNES titles is roughly the same, with more features and gimmicks as you move through each sequel. If you’re playing in single player, the aim is typically to navigate the mazes and either trip switches or defeat all enemies on-screen by dropping bombs at intersections that send fiery might in every orthogonal direction. With each blast, more breakable walls fall away and leave more of the field open, and if you happen to get caught in a blast, Bomberman goes down.</p>
<p>It can be very easy to not realize until it’s too late that you didn’t leave yourself an exit after dropping a bomb, and there’s something delightfully thrilling about tensely tracking the movements of Bomberman, enemies on the field, and various hazards as you try to navigate safely while knocking everyone else out. These single player modes are <em>fine</em>, but it doesn’t take too long before the maps start to get a little repetitive and samey. Plus, there’s just something about the generally slower pace of these levels that makes them feel more like training for the <em>real</em> game that picks up when you have some friends nearby.</p>

<p>Multiplayer is where the compilation really shines, pitting you and up to four other friends against each other in a brutal contest to be the last one standing. Balancing careful strategy with quick skill is necessary to win a given match, as you plot out how to box your foes in without accidentally blowing yourself up in the process. There’s something about the snappy nature of a two minute battle, fighting for control of power ups and scurrying away from bomb blasts left and right, that gets the blood pumping. Every match begins roughly the same, but it rapidly gets much more dynamic as the powerups keep accruing and opponents start finding increasingly more aggressive ways to corral each other into an early death.</p>
<p>It'd be enough fun on just “The Classic” map, but different stages add all sorts of new gimmicks, such as an ice level where cracks in the ice can destroy backtracking routes or a mining stage where mine carts allow players to zip around to different points. These go a long way in adding variety to the gameplay without distracting too much from the core mechanics, heaping on lots more replayability and naturally leading to the emergence of some favorites with a given friend or family group.</p>
<p>I think the real brilliance of Bomberman lies in the genius of its simplicity; although the powerups and environmental gimmicks add some welcome depth, anyone can pick it up and learn how to play in a matter of minutes due to the simple controls and concept. This makes it a very easy party game to break out when others are over, and it doesn’t take long for things to get joyously competitive in all the best ways.</p>

<p>Yet, the main drawback with the multiplayer is that there’s a puzzling lack of a native online component. which feels like something that would’ve been relatively easy to implement here and would’ve gone a long way in adding to the replayability. The main caveat to this is the Switch 2 version has GameShare functionality, which allows you to play online if you set up a GameChat room with friends, but this feels like a hokey way of implementing something of that should be simpler.</p>
<p>This being an emulated collection, Konami also saw fit to include some welcome quality-of-life updates to present these games in their best possible light. Not only do you have an array of display options such as different borders and screen filters, but there’s also support for save states and an easily toggled rewind feature. The save states help to get around the somewhat antiquated password system for marking progress through each story mode, while dropping a bomb in the wrong spot is now something you can cleanly erase by just holding down a button to rewind time a few seconds back for a do-over.</p>

<p>And though it’s certainly not the main draw of the experience, I want to point out the special attention that went into the museum content. Little touches like being able to ‘unbox’ each game and see a render of its original cartridge alongside the original box show how much the developers cared about small details. Plus, it’s really fun seeing all the handmade concept art from around the time each game launched. Game preservation is a big point of discussion these days with many games at risk of becoming lost media, and I think supplementary content like this museum is an important part of ensuring that future generations can receive these games, too.</p>
<p>One topic that bears discussion are the (few) upgrades you get with the Switch 2 Edition. Alongside the aforementioned GameShare functionality, the expected resolution bump is pretty forgettable given that you only really see it when you’re in the menus between the games themselves, and while the online gameplay via GameShare and GameChat is nice, it should’ve been in the base game to begin with. It’s only five dollars to upgrade, but I think the base <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_bomberman_collection">Switch version</a> is perfectly fine to play on either console.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Super Bomberman Collection showcases some of the very best gameplay that Bomberman has to offer. Between the various games on offer, there are dozens of hours of exciting couch multiplayer battles to be had, demonstrating that it doesn’t take the latest and greatest tech for a game to simply be <em>fun</em> to play with others.</p>
<p>Though the lack of native online is disappointing, the great gameplay coupled with some robust museum content that honors the legacy of these games makes this one a no brainer—especially given the relatively cheap price. If you’re looking for another game you can pull out on game nights with friends, I’d highly suggest you pick this one up.</p></section>
