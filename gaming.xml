<p>Maika Monroe fans, unite</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom has released a new live-action short as part of its marketing campaign for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, and it's a banger.</p>
<p>Starring Maika Monroe (<strong>It Follows</strong>, <strong>Longlegs</strong>) as a doting mother caught in the midst of the Raccoon City outbreak, the short effortlessly captures the frantic panic that ensues when the iconic location is overrun by zombies and BOWs.</p>
<p>Toward the end (<strong>spoiler alert if you want to watch it blind</strong>), we see a lonely figure shuffle through the ruined remains of Raccoon City, a photo clutched in her hand as she stops at what seems to be a grave made for a child. Yes, it's Monroe's character, but she's been zombified. A bullet from an unseen shooter takes her out before the following dialogue sounds out over radio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That's the last of 'em. Facility secured."</p>
<p>"Copy that. Raccoon City is ours."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following on-screen message then reads "Evil has always had a face". Intriguing, no?</p>
<p>It's a pretty impressive advertisement for the game; one that comes close to the surprisingly emotional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg">Dead Island trailer</a> from way back when. We know, of course, that the undead featured in Requiem have some remnants of their personalities intact, so we assume this is why the mother is visiting her daughter's grave as a zombie.</p>
<p>Kudos to Capcom for bagging Monroe for the lead too; she's well-loved around these parts for her roles in the horror genre.</p>
<p>We won't have to wait long to see what happens in Requiem. The latest mainline Resident Evil entry launches on the Switch 2 later this month on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/</link>
            <guid>1423045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's officially February, which means that we're finally within the release month for <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>. The new mainline entry in the long-running horror franchise looks like it could be one of the series' best, if it's able to strike the right balance between <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">its <strong>RE2</strong> and <strong>RE7</strong>-inspired sections featuring <strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong> and its <strong>RE4</strong>-inspired sections</a> with the iconic <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/leon-hot-uncle-resident-evil-requiem-capcom-female-staff/">Leon Kennedy</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be arriving on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on <strong>February 27, 2026,</strong> and ahead of that release date, developer <strong>Capcom</strong> has shared a new short film to get players in the mood for the new entry, and to further play on one of the new features the game will include, namely the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-more-unpredictable-than-ever/"><strong>zombies will retain</strong> some of their human memories and actions.</a></p>



<p>The three-and-a-half-minute short film titled "<em>Evil Has Always Had a Name</em>" stars Longlegs actor <strong>Maika Monroe</strong>, and as one viewer put it, it is "<em>better than most RE movies</em>." The film follows a mother and daughter living in Raccoon City ahead of the outbreak that RE2 centers on. It ends with a heartbreaking shot of the mother, now a zombie, visiting her daughter's grave with a photo of them in her hands.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>She's shot by an unidentified patrol group clearing out zombies in the area, but it's clear that her visit is meant to emulate what we've already seen in trailers for Requiem, with zombies repeatedly carrying out actions they did in their human lives.</p>



<p>It's an emotional short that really sets the mood and tone for Resident Evil Requiem, and serves as a tragic reminder that when you're facing off against zombies in Requiem as either Grace or Leon, they were all people once, with their own lives, families, and loved ones.  If the storytelling in the game is able to carry the same emotional weight this short film does, then we're in for an incredible horror experience when Requiem arrives on February 27.</p>



<p>Even before its official release, Requiem is setting up Capcom for a strong year. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">a strong third-quarter financial report for the company (save for the sales of <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> compared to its predecessor)</a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shares-soar-great-sales-forecast-resident-evil-requiem/">company's shares rose by 10%,</a></strong> with strong forecasting thanks to Resident Evil Requiem's imminent arrival, followed by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> coming up in March 2026.</p>



<p>When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">got the chance to check out Requiem during Gamescom 2025</a>, Wccftech's Francecsco De Meo noted that the demo he played "<em>did an excellent job showcasing its survival horror mechanics and how technological advancements will enhance a fairly classic experience</em>." Requiem also made the list for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2026-a-new-era-of-dread/">Wccftech's Most Anticipated Horror Games in 2026</a></strong> and our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-the-return-of-aaa/">Most Anticipated Games of 2026</a></strong> overall.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gog-ai-art-banner-ad-confirms-discord-message-small-team-slop-2000665056</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> (GOG) found itself at the center of online controversy after users claimed a banner ad for a big sales event was created using AI tools. The firestorm only grew larger when a GOG employee seemingly confirmed the ad was created using AI. However, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-caught-using-ai-generated-artwork-2000663836">GOG wouldn’t confirm with <em>Kotaku</em></a> how the banner ad was made. But it has since explained the situation to paying supporters in a private Discord server.</p> <p>On February 2, <em>Kotaku</em> received a screenshot of a message addressing the New Year Sale AI-generated banner situation that was posted in the official GOG Patron Discord server earlier in the day. This is a special Discord server created by GOG for fans who pay <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/patrons">$5 a month to be a part of the store’s Patron program</a>, which lets them talk to other like-minded users while helping to guide the future of the store and being credited when old games are saved.</p>

 <p>In the message, a GOG employee with the username Arthur Slay confirmed that the banner was made “with the help of AI tools” but claimed it was still a “work-in-progress” and wasn’t meant to be displayed on the store publicly. <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/author/artur/"><em>Kotaku</em> believes this user is a GOG marketing employee, Arthur Dejardin.</a></p> <p>“This shouldn’t have happened,” posted Arthur Slay. “We failed on at least two levels: Quality-control of the asset that landed on the front page, and then reacting quickly enough when we noticed the error.”</p>

 <p>Arthur further said that GOG hears all the “disappointment” and acknowledged that it’s “a sensitive topic for many of you.” As for why they used AI tools? Arthur says GOG has been testing different “technologies” ever since the store was founded. “Some experiments are successful, and some (like this banner) are not.” Arthur added: “Exploring various tech gives us the reach of a much larger team, so we never have to settle for doing less.”</p>

 <p>“I also want to be honest about how we chose to explore technology,” posted Arthur. “We don’t have the infinite resources of the industry giants. We’re a dedicated, but small team, working our asses off every day for game preservation. To keep that mission alive, bring more games back to life, and make more games DRM-free, we experiment with tools that can allow us to do more with the limited hands we have.”</p> <p>On January 30, after the ad was called out online in numerous places, GOG told <em>Kotaku</em> via email that it was unable to “comment publicly on our internal processes or tools.” <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted GOG about this Discord message and why the store didn’t share these details with us last week.</p> <hr> <p>Here is the full message from the private Discord as shared with <em>Kotaku</em>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Hi everyone, I’d like to address the case of our recent New Year Sale banner.</em></p> <p><em>First of all, regarding the quality of the asset: This banner was a work-in-progress asset that we mistakenly allowed to be displayed on the storefront. This shouldn’t have happened. We failed on at least two levels: Quality-control of the asset that landed on the front page, and then reacting quickly enough when we noticed the error.</em><br> <em>Second, I want to confirm that this WIP asset was indeed made with the help of Al tools. We hear your disappointment with the use of this technology, and see that it’s a sensitive topic for many of you.</em></p> <p><em>I also want to be honest about how we chose to explore technology: We don’t have the infinite resources of the industry giants. We’re a dedicated, but small team, working our asses off every day for game preservation. To keep that mission alive, bring more games back to life, and make more games DRM-free, we experiment with tools that can allow us to do more with the limited hands we have.</em></p> <p><em>We’ve been testing different technologies since our beginnings. Some experiments are successful, and some (like this banner) are not. Exploring various tech gives us the reach of a much larger team, so we never have to settle for doing less.</em></p> <p><em>Lastly, I’m aware that some of you have concerns about a GOG team member leaving the Patrons Discord server. Please understand that in heated moments, people sometimes need to step back for their own well-being. That was a personal decision, and we respect it.</em></p> <p><em>Thank you, everyone,</em><br> <em>Arthur</em></p></blockquote>

Enemies basically do a little dance before they bring their weapon down on your party, and you’re expected to memorize and dodge every pattern lest you end up dead before your Gommage. Naturally, fans took this as a challenge, and one person has finally beaten Sandfall Interactive’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161"><span>GOTY sweeper</span></a><span> without taking any damage.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber Hayete Bahadori has uploaded a four-hour </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>walkthrough showcasing a damageless run using only one party member in every fight the game allows. Three encounters require you to have a party of three, which doesn’t count against the rules Bahadori set because they’re hardcoded into the game. Pulling off a run like this requires intimate knowledge of just about every required enemy encounter in the game, and Bahadori’s commentary running through each fight sheds plenty of light on patterns that players typically only pick up after repeat plays. If you want to watch the full thing, you can do so below, but it also has time stamps for the big boss fights if you want to jump to a specific encounter.</span></p>

  <p><span>Bahadori says in a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1qs6wtk/i_completed_expedition_33_on_expert_using_a_solo/"><span>Reddit AMA</span></a><span> that the hardest fight to pull off was actually the final battle against Renoir, which has some of the trickiest attack patterns. Despite the video evidence, some </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fans were skeptical that the game could be beaten without taking any damage, as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>emotional damage of its tragic story</span></a><span> is not so easily parried. To which Bahadori responded, “you caught me.”</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the inevitable </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> sequel</span></a><span> will give speedrunners a chance to dodge and parry their way through some crazy attack patterns once again. Or hey, maybe whatever Sandfall Interactive cooks up next will be something completely different. It sounds like the studio is trying </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall-interactive-sequel-2000656692"><span>not to feel beholden to any specific expectations</span></a><span>, so who knows?</span></p>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6">Wordle games are <strong>updated daily at 12 am or Midnight in your respective time zone</strong>.

<h2 id="block-96ac6df0-5b63-4788-9eff-98ceece739ee">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does ARC Raiders Have A PvE Mode? ARC Raiders PvE Rumor, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pve-mode/</link>
            <guid>1423027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Between PvP, PvE, and PvPvE, there are a lot of terms to remember in online shooters. ARC Raiders is notorious for its player versus player and player versus AI gameplay, but many raiders just want a PvE experience.</p>



<p>The thought of coming up against another human player is a double-edged sword in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders.</a> On one hand, they could be a noob and a far less tough adversary compared to AI, or they could be a pinpoint wizard who can laser you from a mile away.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-there-a-pve-mode-in-arc-raiders">Is There A PvE Mode In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All too familiar. Credit to Embark</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders does not have a dedicated PvE mode, and playlist options are restricted purely to PvPvE gameplay, incorporating both human and AI threats.</strong></p>



<p>The call for a PvE-specific game mode grows stronger week by week. ARC Raiders’ player base is still holding strong months after launch, but a large segment of the audience wants PvE.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More IG: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-budget-was-75-million-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders budget was $75 Million, it’s claimed</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Embark is freshening things up, but a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking</a> option isn’t something people are crying out for. The community wants PvE, and they currently aren’t getting it.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-pve-rumor-explained">ARC Raiders PvE Rumor, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>A social media post from the <a href="https://x.com/SperanzaIntel"></a>Speranza Intel X account unexpectedly went viral and caused a lot of confusion as it unintentionally caused ARC Raiders fans to think Embark had confirmed a PvE mode was arriving in 2026.</strong><a href="https://x.com/SperanzaIntel"></a></p>



<p>On February 1, <a href="https://x.com/SperanzaIntel"></a>Speranza Intel posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Embark Studios has officially ⁿᵒᵗ confirmed the introduction of a PvE mode, planned for release in Q2 2026.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of the way it’s worded and the style of the font and size on “not,” it’s very easy to overlook the word. The message has since racked up over 800,000 views on X, and word of mouth through the grapevine is a powerful and dangerous tool.</p>



<p>The account later apologized for the initial message, outing its “joke tweet,” and confirming that Embark has given no confirmation about a PvE mode.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry, we didn’t expect this tweet to blow up. It was meant to be a joke tweet, but since many of you seem to have misread it, let us clarify. It says that Embark Studios has not officially confirmed this.</p>— Speranza Intel (@SperanzaIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/SperanzaIntel/status/2018064473148502143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-will-pve-ever-come-to-arc-raiders">Will PvE Ever Come To ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More of this would be nice. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The developer is always working on new content for ARC Raiders, and while Embark has not mentioned that PvE is coming, it’s always a possibility.</strong></p>



<p>This is 100% specualtion more than anything else. However, Embark generally listens to fans. With so much planned in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 roadmap</a> and more game modes and LTMs on the way, it’s impossible to rule out a PvE-only mode arriving.</p>

Why do we bring this up now, you might ask? Well, because <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> creator Yuji Horii will soon get the same treatment (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/manga-detailing-the-life-of-dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-in-educational-rpg-style-to-release-on-february-24/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Unofficially titled '<strong>Dragon Quest Creator Yuji Horii: New Educational Manga Biography</strong>' (translated by Automaton), the manga is supposedly a semi-dramatised retelling of the developer's life, predominantly focusing on his Dragon Quest work — no surprises there, then. Its <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=nlife0b-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon listing</a> even suggests that it'll frame the story as an RPG itself, with Horii-san recruiting people to his 'party' and 'levelling up' with new skills.</p>
<p>The manga is being published by Shogakukan, with illustrations by Iori Makoto, and it'll feature an interview with Horii-san himself at the end. While no official English translation has been announced at the time of writing, the book is set to launch in Japan on <strong>24th February</strong> for 1,210 yen (roughly £6/$8).</p>
<p>We can't take a peek at the manga's contents just yet, but here's a closer look at the cover art:</p>
<figure data-uuid="dc61910ccbb0e"><a title="Yuji Horii Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc61910ccbb0e/yuji-horii-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4092702078?tag=mare07-22&amp;linkCode=osi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1">Shogakukan</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This will be the latest game developer to join Shogakukan's biography series. Back in 2018, the publisher released a similar deep dive on Pokémon's Satoshi Tajiri, all about the founding of <em>another</em> hugely popular RPG series. Who will be next, we wonder?</p>

            <p>
NaissancE developers Limasse Five have released a big update for SenS, their early access open world spelunking game in which you search an enveloping Structure for Unique Places, tools and artefacts. The ExistencE of SenS is news to me, despite it being very much my cup of ImpossiblE ArchitecturE. 
</p>
<p>
Launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966170/SenS">Steam</a> in 2022, it’s a work of torqued cuboids, sunken pockets of city, and vaguely fractal fissures. While there are no living or active threats, as far as I can tell, you do have to worry about traps and Unstable Zones - “simple or even abstract architectural structures at the beginning, but getting more complex, vast and labyrinthine the further you go.” Unstable Zones change in the dark. So you’ll need to use Luces - glowballs - and other tools to solidify paths and access points.

<p>
The Unique Places, meanwhile, are “strange and beautiful” portals to other parts of the Structure. Some harbour objects you can decorate your starting home environment with. Others contain tools such as “bags to carry more stuff, tools, candles, lanterns and gas, lamps and electric cables, ropes to climb [and] ladders”, plus objects that give you new “capacities”.
</p><p>
SenS is "the evolved vision of the Naissance project", lead developer Mavros Sedeño writes on Steam. It’s certainly not hard to trace the throughline from NaissanceE, though this appears to be a much larger gameworld. The developer’s cited influences may not surprise you either, if you’re a seasoned blunderer of the Backrooms – Blame! mangaka Tsutomo Nihei, Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and Foundation SCP. 
</p>
<p>
The new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1966170/view/515231646168909598?l=english">released earlier this month</a>, follows a long break in development. It makes it “possible to experience some layers of the exploration gameplay”, including “a few unique safe places hidden inside the Unstable Zone”. Sedeño cautions that the game’s systems are still at the prototype stage, and that you can expect a few bugs. It sounds like the bugs will be perfectly at home in these cosmic dungeons.
</p>
<p>Sedeño hopes to offer more regular updates in future, which "should be easy considering the last update was over a year ago". He already has some new Unique Places to add, but it "takes time to build an interesting level design to reach those, as well as coding and debugging new features to improve the gameplay up to what I have in mind".</p>
<p>He would also "love to improve the visual quality on the level art, effects, sounds and music, but it's also very time consuming and I prioritize the work on the overall game experience, [leaving] the game art in unfinished state for now." I'd say the game art is pretty eye-grabbing as it stands.</p><p>
SenS is clearly a long way from done, but if you’re convinced, it’s 20% off till 4th February. I adored NaissanceE’s space and architecture, though I agree with Jim Rossignol’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naissance-review-pc">withering assessment</a> of certain jump puzzles. I look forward to getting lost in this new cathedral of godflesh.

            <p>Team Fortress 2 Classified is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3545060/Team_Fortress_2_Classified/">out now on Steam</a>, the mod having finally earned Valve’s blessing after a bit of a tizzy with its former name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-mod-classic-is-now-classified-literally-and-gets-a-short-delay-into-2026">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a>. That makes it an easy one-click job to install, assuming you have the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">TF2</a> installed, and it’s a fine piece of modding work in general: inspired by the shooter’s past without being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">beholden to nostalgia</a>, while expanding itself with restored modes and weapons that Valve left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>Wisely, Team Fortress 2 Classified doesn’t drag itself all the way back to TF2’s very earliest days, where sticky bombs could explode through doors and glitched-out Engineers could build sentry guns in the sky. It is a simplified game in some ways, its lack of comedy cosmetics a proud selling point, but it keeps most of Valve’s best balance tweaks (Pyro airblast, movable Engie buildings, fewer bullshit pipe bombs for the Demo), Thus, it never feels like an stubborn old man of a mod, refusing to get with the times.</p>
<p>Its own additions are thoughtfully worked in, too. VIP mode, in which one team escorts a waddling businessman while the other attempts to give him the Archduke Franz Ferdinand treatment, was ditched by Valve on account of it essentially spoiling one player’s – the VIP's – round by making them a defenceless civvy. In TF2 Classified, they’ve become more of an active support class, defensively buffing nearby teammates and occasionally powering up his bodyguards with a spell of mini-crits. The mode still plays out broadly like Payload, Valve’s bomb-pushing official replacement, but the 'It sucks being VIP' problem is solved; he’s the one teammate everyone wants to hang out with.</p>
<p>I’m less sold on some of the guns. The Scout’s nailgun, for instance, behaves almost indistinguishably from the Medic’s default syringe gun, and denies the little Bostonian nitwit the timelessly high risk/high reward Scout play of ploughing through someone with two point-blank Scattergun blasts. The Soldier, meanwhile, gets a weird arc-firing rocket launcher alt whose single shot makes playing Solly even more of an exercise in reloading. All the base game defaults are here, though, and sticking to them is no bad time. If anything, they reminded me of how lightning-in-a-bottle good TF2’s class loadouts are: for all the sidegrades and alternatives Valve have poured into it over the years, the original tools have always stayed viable and reliable.</p>

<p>Team Fortress 2 Classified understands that, and shows that knowing what <em>not</em> to touch is an important to a great mod as knowing what to change. I’ll definitely be playing more of it, and I may even be willing to overlook its one serious offence: in entirely removing custom cosmetics, the mod makes it impossible to wear <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Horace">the Horace hat</a>. Pshaw! Be sure to express your own disapproval of this wanton act of endless bear prejudice (and claim your own wearable Horace) by joining the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subscribe">RPS Premium Supporters programme</a> for the low, low price of £5.99 per month. While stocks last, which because they are pixels, is forever.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>A home is not a given.&nbsp;</p><p>Living in a place, like game designer Luke Li has in the United States for the past 14 years, does not give you a right to call it home forever. And increasingly, at least as far as the U.S. is concerned, fairness is not necessarily part of the equation.</p><p>“Our deadline is in about six months,” said the 27-year-old, who currently resides in New York, in a recent interview with <em>Remap</em>. “We have to get out in six months if we don't have anything.”</p><p>Li is part of a team called BROKENCIGS, made up of roughly eight developers, a mixture of part-timers and contractors. A few developers are U.S. residents, but others, like Li, are from China. BROKENCIGS came together during their time at the renowned NYU Game Center. Some team members, worried about rejected applications and financial stress, have gone back home to China. Others, like Li and a fellow BROKENCIGS designer, Cindy Fan, want to stay.</p><p>art19:f9f19d71-d5a0-4c9a-8999-ddc918d4c697</p><p>“Living in New York for two years together with our teammates is a really essential memory for us,” said Fan, who's been in the U.S. for nine years. “To still stay together and keep doing what we're doing [is important].”</p><p>Why New York? <em>Because it’s New York</em>. Li and others were drawn to it because of its cultural appeal. People who want to make it big come to New York. They did. And then it became home.</p><p>"New York really blew my mind with the amount of stimulation there was when I first visited," said Li, who is from the northern part of China. "The events, museums, bars (there are just too many good bars out here), people, and game-focused opportunities are all reasons that we do not wish to let go of yet."</p><figure><figcaption><span>BROKENCIGS hopes to continue working on </span><i><em>Inkression</em></i><span>, no matter what happens.</span></figcaption></figure><p>BROKENCIGS’ guiding light for the past few years <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2965930/Inkression/?ref=remapradio.com">has been <em>Inkression</em></a>, an ambitious narrative game inspired by their home away from home and its art scene. <em>Inkression</em> is, interestingly, a story about a home being ripped away from you, a place you love disappearing because of a policy change. Forces beyond your control. It’s a lot like the situation BROKENCIGS is facing.</p><p>“I’m talking to my friends who've played our demo already and they were like ‘Huh, did you guys write this story because of this situation?’” laughed Fan. “Sometimes it feels like it's like a big foreshadowing in a movie.”</p><p>What prompted our conversation was a plea for help in an email pitch. It’s easy to scroll past the dozens of games vying for your inbox attention, but the humanity behind this one stood out.&nbsp;</p><p>“I am writing to you to kindly ask about the potential possibility for a press coverage as our team's current status in the country is about to expire,” reads an email I received in early January, “and we are looking at petitioning for the O-1 visa so that we could continue working on our dream games in the city that inspired all of them.”</p><p>I've read a lot of pitches in my years. But nothing like this.</p><p>“The question for us immigrants is just really about,” said Li. “Do we want to go back to where we came from? Or do we want to continue doing what we do here in where we are right now?”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a sucker for nostalgia, so I have yet to tire of the enhanced ports, remasters, and remakes that are all the rage these days. I love revisiting games from simpler times, sporting fresh graphics and handy new features, but I also enjoy completely new takes on them I would never have expected. Dragon Quest VII already got the latter treatment on 3DS a decade ago, and now Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is ringing in the 40th anniversary of the series with a fine third iteration, though it’s not one without sacrifices. This time around, there is a clear focus on improving the pacing of one of Dragon Quest’s most notorious entries, and Square Enix has succeeded in that regard – but some of the other adjustments Reimagined makes in an effort to appeal to newer players have come at the expense of longtime fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alone on a small island in a vast ocean, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined tells the tale of a humble fisherman’s son (your main character) and his childhood friends, the outspoken Maribelle and the rebellious and brotherly Prince Keifer, as they seek out fragments of 17 magical tablets in an effort to restore the world. Their quest takes them to the pits of volcanoes, under the sea, high into the sky, and even through time itself, meeting new allies and uncovering dark secrets from history along the way. I’ve always thought Dragon Quest VII stands out among the series, approaching its storytelling in a different and engaging way thanks to those time-travel elements and how it reveals the overarching story over the course of the adventure. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of a single sprawling plot that grows increasingly complex, Dragon Quest VII weaves a tapestry from many seemingly independent strands into a final work of art – a grand story the Dragon Quest games are known for, but one that’s hidden at the start. That really helps drive home its themes of isolation, with the oddly disconnected nature of each island’s tale being lessened as you literally rebuild the world. Add in that you get to see how your actions in the past echo through into the present, and this still remains one of my favorite stories of the Dragon Quest series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing the world of Dragon Quest VII into the modern era of high-definition graphics, Reimagined sports a brand-new art style inspired by a puppet-and-diorama aesthetic that does a really good job of depicting Akira Toriyama’s original cast of characters. The proportions of these particular heroes have always been a bit more chibi compared to others in the franchise, but here muted tones and being able to see the fabric materials of hats and clothing have replaced the vivid colors and dramatic, anime-inspired outlines that I usually adore about Dragon Quest. The fact that Reimagined removed the 3DS version’s outfit changes for the different vocations saddens me as well. I admittedly found myself growing more accustomed to the puppet-y look as I went, and both my wife and my two-year-old loved to point out how cute everything was as I played, but I’d still be fine if this art style ended up being a “one and done” affair. </p><p>This remains one of my favorite stories of the Dragon Quest series.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Reimagined retains much of the same classic RPG goodness that the Dragon Quest series has held onto these long decades, but it also introduces more goodies than just a facelift to mix up the adventure. New Monster Heart accessories impart unique aspects to the character they are equipped to, such as reducing your MP to zero but doubling your strength or increasing the damage you dish out with each subsequent attack. You can now take out weaker enemies in the field without ever entering combat as well, cutting them down from the world map itself. As nifty as both of these additions are, they are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I found more fun to mess around with and build my team around were the powerful Let Loose attacks, which are super moves that act as Reimagined’s take on the Square staple Limit Break concept, and the ability to have characters equip two vocations at a time. Both of these can result in some deliciously broken combos that feel great to pull off. Anyone currently equipped with the Priest vocation will be able to fully heal and revive the entire party with its Born Again action, while the Troubadour's Encore ability will temporarily reduce the party’s MP costs to zero. My personal favorites were the Champion’s Divide and Monk’s Critical Stance, with the former causing three copies to appear and perform whatever action you pick that turn, and the latter guaranteeing your next physical attack to be a critical hit – a particularly devastating option when using the Monk’s Multifist attack that hits seven times. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s nice that the new Moonlighting feature that allows each party member to have two vocations at a time provides both their specific stat buffs and access to their toolkit of spells and abilities. Accessible a few hours after unlocking the vocation system itself, I appreciate the flexibility that Moonlighting offers in adjusting how you want your team to run. What I like even more is that there are no downsides or restrictions with whatever you pick for that Moonlighting spot – both vocations earn the same amount of experience points after combat, and it just speeds up the whole process of unlocking the especially good advanced vocations that require you to have mastered multiple other ones already. Keeping one of those mastered vocations equipped even gives the non-mastered role a boost with extra vocation experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, especially the original PlayStation release, were known – almost notoriously so – for how long they could take to play through or get to the cool stuff, like combat or unlocking character classes for your party of heroes. Addressing those pacing issues was a core principle behind Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, and some of those changes are more welcome than others, but the pursuit has been a success overall. You’ll get to swing your sword (or sticks, in this case) at some monsters for the first time within 30 minutes of starting Reimagined, and I was able to get to Alltrades Abbey to unlock the vocation system, the crux of your party customization, around 11 hours later. To put the difference here into perspective, at one point I booted up a save from my 3DS version of Dragon Quest VII that was at roughly the same spot: not only was I five levels higher in  Reimagined with twice as many vocations mastered, I had also done all that in half the time. When I rolled credits in Reimagined, I clocked in at just over 46 hours, with my party hovering right around level 50, which is much shorter than both previous versions – although that time doesn’t include either of the post-game dungeons or going for 100%, which will likely put you up to the 70+ hour mark. </p><p>Reimagined has smoothed away a crucial sense of discovery and challenge.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that this adjusted pacing has come at the cost of some parts of the original game being removed, with producer Takeshi Ichikawa being transparent about how locations such as El Ciclo, Gröndal, and Providence were left on the cutting room floor. Certain areas and dungeons have been reduced in size, too, with the boat the main character’s father departs on right out of the gate now being only a single level instead of two. The Sunken Citadel in the Wetlock region is another such example, with the dungeon being basically removed altogether and replaced with a short, straight-shot corridor. Losses like that are certainly disappointing, but outside of the occasional dungeon feeling a bit small, I actually really enjoyed how the story flows now, and I never felt an obvious gap or awkward break caused by “missing” content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I think has had a more noticeable negative impact on the pacing, though, is how Reimagined has seemingly smoothed over nearly every aspect of the original that could potentially cause even the smallest bit of discomfort or aggravation. That may sound fine on the surface, but it has resulted in the removal of things that have traditionally helped define this series, taking away much of that crucial sense of discovery. When I boot up a Dragon Quest game, I expect that the journey will take me into some headwinds and that there will be points where I struggle with a challenge to overcome. In Reimagined, I found none of that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In any other Dragon Quest, managing your resources – be it your HP, your MP, or your consumables – is something you always need to keep in mind. For example, you have to weigh the benefits of an encounter with whether or not you can spare the MP to end that fight quickly, at the expense of not being able to cast your biggest spells as many times in the eventual boss fight. In contrast, Reimagined bombards you with free healing statues, respawning items that refill both health and magic are all over the place, characters fully heal whenever they level up, and party members that die during a fight even respawn with a single hit point afterwards, doing away with that classic Dragon Quest imagery of seeing your lone character leading around a parade of colorful coffins in a dreary dungeon. And if you do find yourself in a situation where everyone dies, the penalty is so minimal, forcing you to lose only 1,000 gold as opposed to half of your total, that even that threat is far from scary. The first time I actually had to pay this fee was in the very last dungeon, playing on hard difficulty, and at that point I was more just curious to see what would happen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Individual carrying bags have been done away with in favor of a single shared inventory as well, making it so you don’t have to worry about strategically divvying up your items. (And you have no need to worry about accidentally equipping a cursed item you can’t get off – those are gone now.) There are some difficulty options you can toggle and adjust, such as lowering or raising the amount of experience, vocation points, or gold you earn after a fight (though, unfortunately, you can’t set them to zero), but none of the other stuff I mentioned is included in those settings. In fact, you can choose to make things even <em>easier </em>for yourself by fully restoring your party after every encounter.</p><p>This really is a literal reimagining of Dragon Quest VII as a sort of “My First Dragon Quest."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This handholding approach, where you almost can’t fail, even extends into the main questline. So much of the sense of exploration and discovery has been removed, with enough information being fed to you that quests almost turn into a simple matter of glancing over your screen to find where the big icon is. Is there a tablet fragment in your location? You’ll see a marker on your map letting you know one is somewhere nearby, which turns the hunt for them into an almost mundane task to check off a list rather than the epic, world-saving mission it’s made out to be. You don’t even have to try spells out on enemies anymore to know how they might affect them, as an icon over the monster's head will show whether the one you have highlighted is weak or strong against it, or if they will resist it altogether.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having recently played through last year's spectacular HD-2D remakes of Dragon Quests I &amp; II, all of this smoothing gave me whiplash. That package added some solid accessibility options to help newer players, but it still retained – and in many cases expanded – the challenge of the originals. Dragon Quest VII Reimagined feels like it goes in the complete opposite direction, with the only real challenge coming from the last hour of the story and the post-game grind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all said, the more I played this new version, the more I eventually came to accept it for what it was, even if that wasn’t exactly what I was expecting or looking for. Between its faster pacing, toy-like aesthetic, and insistence on reducing pain points, this really is a literal reimagining of Dragon Quest VII as a sort of “My First Dragon Quest” entry point for new players. Once that realization clicked, I just let myself enjoy the ride as I soaked in a story and characters I still adored – I just also had to come to grips with the fact that it wasn’t going to deliver the challenge and discovery that I usually play Dragon Quest games for. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Every version of Dragon Quest VII is a flawed gem, with its own blemishes and imperfections, but gems they all remain. The way it reveals its world to you stands out from any other game in this long-running series, and seeing the results of your actions in the past affect the present day is just as charming now as it was when I first put the disk in my PlayStation. That said, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined won’t be the version of this adventure I reach for when I want to revisit the islands of Pilchard Bay or the desert sands of Al-Balad. The original’s pacing issues have successfully been addressed here, but it’s unfortunate so much has been smoothed over or removed as a result – the challenge, some of the quirky personality, and that all-important sense of discovery I expect from a Dragon Quest game. I really do appreciate and applaud Square Enix for creating a beginner-friendly Dragon Quest, but I also wish more difficulty options had been included to let returning fans like me opt out of that easier tuning. So while Reimagined may not shine in the same way Dragon Quest’s other recent remakes have, this simplified quest is still one worth completing, if for nothing else than bearing witness to Keifer’s awesome chin.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been difficult at times for new mainline releases in the Civilization series of games to win over new players right out of the gate. For <em>Civilization VII</em>—which launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">just shy of one year ago</a>—the struggles seemed to go deeper, with some players saying it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">didn’t feel</a> like a Civilization game.</p>
<p><em>Civ VII’</em>s developers, Firaxis Games, announced today it is planning an update this spring called “Test of Time” that rethinks a few unpopular changes, in some cases replacing key mechanics from the original release.</p>
<p>I spoke with Ed Beach, the Civilization franchise’s creative director, as well as Dennis Shirk, its executive producer, about what’s changing, the team’s interpretation of the player backlash to the choices in the initial release, and Firaxis and 2K’s plans for the future of the Civilization model.</p>
<h2>The heart of the controversy</h2>
<p>There were of course bugs, balance issues, and missing documentation and UI features, and there have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/civilization-vii-patch-lets-you-turn-off-some-controversial-new-features/">updates</a> to address some of those issues, with more to come.</p>
<p>For example, I asked about two oft-requested features: a city connections view, and the classic hot seat local multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Beach said a connections view is in the works, though it will come after the big spring update. As for hot seat, he said that “there are some key members of our development team who feel passionately about getting that out.”</p>
<p>Shirk promised that’s coming too, but declined to say when.</p>
<p>But the real heart of the controversy is that <em>Civ VII</em> broke with what a lot of players considered core DNA for the series.</p>
<p>“We introduced all these great new mechanics because we wanted to give our players something new to chew on because they had something very similar from <em>IV</em> or <em>V</em> to <em>VI</em>,” said Shirk. “It was like if we were making <em>Madden</em> and we decided they’re going to play with a soccer ball instead of a football.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>For example, <em>Civ VII</em> lets players play any historical leader with any civilization and requires them to leave behind their initial civilization pick in favor of a new one mid-game—not just once, but twice, at the beginning of the second and third ages, phases of play with distinct tech trees and mechanics.</p>
<p>“I am a huge fan of British history, and so going from the Romans to the Normans to a Great Britain, that feels very natural to me. But it’s not natural to everybody,” Beach said. “As soon as you introduce those type of civ changes and the mixing and mashing with any leader, all of a sudden I think there’s an immersion element.</p>
<p>“We got feedback in some of our focus testing before the game shipped that there was going to be some level of controversy here, but we didn’t realize quite how strongly players identified with the idea of, ‘I need to take some people and grow them and have that specific civilization cultural set be what’s growing to face the challenges of world history,’” he added.</p>
<p>I mentioned prior big changes, like the switch in <em>Civ V</em> from the series’ classic “stacks of doom” military gameplay to a more granular, one-unit-one-tile approach to combat, and asked why the changes in <em>Civ VII</em> were so much more divisive than something like that.</p>

<p>“The difference… was the immersive storytelling versus the mechanics,” Shirk explained. Features like one-unit-one-tile “were mechanical changes that did not impact the immersion, the emotional storytelling that you’re telling yourself in your head.”</p>
<p>“It’s not all about the mechanics,” he said. “It’s about the game that players want to build for themselves.”</p>
<h2>One civilization to stand the test of time</h2>
<p>Starting with the Test of Time update, players will have the option to play one civilization through all three of the game’s ages. Each civ will have an apex age when it will have access to its full kit. In other ages, it will keep some of its kit, but it will also gain an age-appropriate culture tree, and the player will be able to use a new system to give their civ access to unique units or infrastructure from another civilization that would call the current age its apex.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>At the start of an age, AI leaders will follow the player’s lead—if the player decides to stick with their existing civ, the others will stay, too. If they decide to switch to a new one, the AI will be able to do the same.</p>
<p>The idea is that this allows for players to not only pick which approach suits their preferences, but to change their mind mid-game, without a lock-in from the game settings at initialization.</p>

<h2>Victories and triumphs</h2>
<p>The update will also rethink both how victory works in the game, and the controversial legacy paths system, which saw players trying to achieve linear, prescribed goals within each age to gain bonuses for the following one (or in the case of the modern age, to win in the end).</p>
<p>Whereas the base game delayed any direct work on victories until the third and final age (modern), Test of Time will let players begin making progress toward a victory from the very first age (antiquity), and if they manage to take a very strong lead, it will actually be possible to win the game outright in the second age (exploration).</p>

<p>As before, there will be four victory conditions, but a few will be rethought for this new context. The cultural victory will be achieved through a custom combination of wonders, great works, celebrations, and more. Military will remain focused on conquering cities and towns. Economic will, like culture, add up a bunch of things, including resources, gold buildings, factories, and treasure convoys. And the scientific victory will remain a space race.</p>
<p>Additionally, Firaxis is removing the concept of legacy paths from the game completely. It will be replaced with a new system called “triumphs.”</p>
<p>Firaxis’ goal here is to make the gameplay more of a sandbox like prior titles, with less rigidity in how players work their way toward success.</p>
<p>Instead of following a preset sequence of goals, the player will pick and choose from a large menu of possible accomplishments, each of which is associated with the six leader attributes: cultural, military, economic, scientific, diplomatic, and expansionist. Completing a triumph will either give players an immediate reward or a card they can use to set themselves up at the start of the next age.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Examples include milestones like reaching 200 population, being the first to build a university, claiming most of the world’s natural wonders, or being at war with every other civilization.</p>
<p>Beach explained his thinking on triumphs. “We purposely set it up so, rather than like pathways through an age, we’re looking at it sort of like as a constellation of objectives, and you choose four or five of those guide stars to move towards,” he said. “But they’re varied enough and they’re difficult enough that there’s no way you can complete all of them.”</p>
<p>There will be default rewards that players can claim at Age transition even if they don’t achieve any triumphs at all, an affordance Beach says is for beginner players.</p>

<p>During development, triumphs were considered alongside a very different alternative: simply doubling the number of legacy paths—two culture, two economic, two military, and two science. “But we look at that versus this sort of more open-ended triumph system, and we liked the open-endedness of it,” Beach said.</p>
<p>Triumphs are also designed in such a way that modders will be able to “easily” add them to the game. Firaxis is also workshopping something called “triumph sets,” which would allow players to configure their game at the start with specific limited packages of possible triumphs tailored to certain playstyles or challenges.</p>
<p>“We have [players] that are saying, I’d love it if you actually randomized the triumphs so I don’t even know going into the game which ones I’m going to be presented with,” Beach said. “We’re holding off on that for right now. That’s sort of a future idea.”</p>
<h2>33-33-33</h2>
<p>These are big changes that aim to walk the line of retaining what makes <em>VII</em> unique, while satisfying players of V and VI who felt it went way too far.</p>
<p>Civilization creator Sid Meier famously had a rule for sequels: 33 percent of a new game should retain systems that were established in the prior entry, 33 percent should substantially improve prior systems, and 33 percent should be brand-new systems and mechanics.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“I actually was challenged by my design team, and they wanted to change even more, way blowing past that 33-33-33 rule,” said Beach. “I would actually numerically try to add up how much change we were talking about and demonstrate to them that we had blown way past those guidelines and start to try to rein them in and say, well, out of these systems that we want to make updates to, let’s pull back a couple of these and keep a couple of them the same because we’re just overdoing it in terms of how innovative we want to be here.”</p>
<p>He said that in the end, “we still probably violated the 33-33-33 rule by going a little bit heavier into a new approach to everything, but there were some things we really wanted to tackle.”</p>
<h2>Why&nbsp;<em>VII</em> changed so much</h2>
<p>Beach and Shirk&nbsp;explained a little bit about how the game ended up where it did.</p>
<p>“I think part of that comes out of <em>Civ VI</em> being the longest development cycle we’ve ever had before,” Beach said. The team worked on that entry in some way or another for roughly 11 years.</p>
<p>Going into <em>VII</em>, “we spent longer on our postmortem than we ever had before,” Beach recalled. “We had whiteboards filled with thoughts on every single system and what was good about it and what wasn’t good about it.”</p>
<p>“We wanted to tackle that late game problem of the combinatorial explosion,” he explained—referring to how some players of prior Civ games felt that the amount of things to control becomes unwieldy toward the end of a long playthrough, thanks to “so many cities to manage, so many units to manage, too much micromanagement.”</p>
<p>“We just saw a lot of data about people never finishing games and just deciding at some point, I’ve gotten what I can out of this game, this game is now a chore,” he said.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The team also wanted to make the game more modular and extensible, so it would be easier to design and add new systems post-launch. He cited frustrations working on <em>Civ VI</em>, where the combinatorial explosion problem was already so significant that it became a deterrent to adding new things to the game.</p>

<h2>Testing a new approach</h2>
<p>Based on Firaxis’ experience with <em>Civ VII</em>‘s reception, the studio is trying some new things to incorporate player feedback earlier in the development process for new mechanics or systems.</p>
<p>“It’s the worst-kept secret in the world that we’ve had this external test team for quite a few years called our Frankenstein Group,” noted Beach. It’s a small group of people—fewer than 50—who help test out new ideas and give feedback.</p>
<p>Now, that’s being expanded with a workshop program facilitated by publisher 2K that loops in many more members of the game’s community for play sessions and feedback rounds.</p>
<p>Shirk said this is a big departure from how things were done in the <em>Civ V</em> and <em>Civ VI</em> eras. With <em>V</em>, the team would release an update, then browse Reddit and sites like CivFanatics to see the reception. “In <em>VI</em>, we actually got to introduce more data and telemetry just to see how players were playing, but still a lot of us just looking at the forums,” he added.</p>
<p>I asked if Firaxis and 2K would consider the early access model, which is more typical for non-AAA games, for future Civ titles. “It’s one of those things that you can never say never,” Shirk responded. “As developers, we’re always looking at that jealously because we see that it’s a great opportunity.”</p>
<p>Both Beach and Shirk claimed that the audience of Civilization has expanded significantly over the past few games. You can’t please everyone, but more than most other games in the 4X or grand strategy genre that can be satisfied with serving a niche, Civilization—a franchise that has intermittently been the gold standard of genre across its 35-year history—has to try.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Back in November, <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;publisher Paradox <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/cities-skylines-upheaval-developer-and-publisher-announce-mutual-breakup/">made the surprising announcement</a> that longtime series developer Colossal Order would be ceasing work on the series as part of a “mutual” breakup. Now, we’re getting our first glimpse into the kinds of patches and upgrades new developer Iceflake (<em>Surviving the Aftermath</em>) is prioritizing for the popular city-builder going forward.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/502848649741467986?l=english">a City Corner Developer Diary</a> posted late last week, Iceflake focuses mainly on the visual improvements it’s planning for its first major <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;patch. Chief among these is improvements to the game’s user interface that Iceflake admits can “sometimes be a bit confusing when it comes to communicating things.”</p>
<p>The new patch will include a “streamlined” onboarding process for new cities, more expressive and context-aware icons, and toolbars with clearer colors and visual style. A new in-game Encyclopedia will also let players search through information about different gameplay topics, though that feature likely won’t be ready for Iceflake’s first patch.</p>
<p>As for the look of the cities, Iceflake says it’s taking inspiration from <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/84638/Windows">an existing “recolor” patch</a>, integrating the ability to set custom colors for buildings, props, and vehicles into the base game. Players will eventually be able to recolor trees, plants, and other props as well, but this will also have to wait for a later patch.</p>

            <guid>1422949</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following a string of successful releases, Bethesda has struggled to deliver the same level of quality it did with <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong></a></em>. Although <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong></em> has received <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/"><strong>significant improvements</strong></a> since its launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong><em>Starfield</em></strong></a> has yet to receive the same treatment, as, aside from some minor improvements and additional content, the latest open-world RPG from the studio is essentially still <strong>the same game it was at launch in late 2023.</strong></p>



<p><span>Though it is undeniable that the game feels&nbsp;<strong>a little dated</strong>&nbsp;compared to other modern open-world role-playing games, the Skyrim design lead thinks Starfield would have been&nbsp;<strong>received</strong>&nbsp;much better if it were put out by <strong>another studio</strong>, without the burden of very high expectations</span>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout"><strong>PressBox PR</strong></a>, Skyrim's design lead Bruce Nesmith was asked about the incredibly high expectations many have for <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>The Elder Scrolls 6</strong></a></em> and the inevitable<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/"><strong>Fallout 5</strong></a></em>, and how the "<em>game of expectations"</em> may <strong>impact</strong> the perception of both games.</p>



<p><em>"I am very fond of a phrase called the game of expectations, and I've been trotting the game of expectations out for well over a decade. Bethesda's in the bad position of having expectations being so high they cannot be met,"</em> said Nesmith. "<em>Managing expectations is the number one thing a good marketing department has to do. Let's take a look at Starfield. Let's assume that a new studio had put out Starfield. I suspect it would be talked about like the second coming. But because it was released by Bethesda, the expectations were so much higher that it was seen differently. Starfield is a good game. It's a very good game. It's just not the game that people expected it to be."</em></p>



<p>Although Bethesda lost this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"game of expectations" </em>with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em>, the studio is in a<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> better position</strong> for both<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> The Elder Scrolls 6</em> and<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Fallout 5</em>, as, according to Nesmith, the high expectations for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Skyrim</em> coming from <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion</em> (whose remake proved successful enough on all formats, although <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/around-half-of-oblivion-remastered-players-on-ps5-played-for-less-than-15-hours-nostalgia-is-powerful-but-only-so-much/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nostalgia didn't translate into great player engagement</strong></a>) and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 4</em> were fully met. However, it won't be easy: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Boy, do they have their work cut out for them,"</em> Nesmith said, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">agreeing</strong> with former Bethesda Lead Artist Nate Purkeypile about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>challenges the sixth entry in The Elder Scrolls series will face.</strong></a></p>



<p>While <em>Starfield</em> has not met the high expectations of Bethesda's fans, the game reportedly has <strong>a shot to do so</strong> with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>rumored massive update</strong></a>. Allegedly launching this year when the game will hit PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2, this "Cyberpunk 2.0 style" update will <strong>address some of the most common complaints</strong>, such as load screens, improved space flight, and more.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to <strong>make players return</strong> to a game that had a lot of potential that was ultimately squandered by a series of questionable game design choices? Only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Black Tabby Games has revealed that its surreal horror visual novel <em>Slay the Princess </em>has reached a new sales milestone, and the studio has divulged sales figures for <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>as well.</p><p>Per a new press release, <em>Slay the Princess </em>has managed to reach a million sales across all platforms. As a reminder, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slay-princess-is-new-time-loop-rpg-with-gorgeous-art" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24809200-53e9-4bd9-816c-f6276e727e7a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched on PC first back in October 2023</a> before getting itself a console release in 2024.</p><p>Black Tabby's Tony Howard-Arias says the studio, which consists of Tony and their partner Abby, is "immeasurably grateful" for the reception <em>Slay the Princess </em>has garnered, and they express hope that the game's success means people will realize "visual novels are a serious medium".</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not just <em>Slay the Princess </em>that is celebrating a new sales milestone. Black Tabby's first game, <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>, has managed to hit 100,000 sales since the release of its first episode back in June 2021.</p><p>The two games are very different prospects, of course; <em>Slay the Princess </em>is a self-contained experience with an absurd amount of branching and reaction to player choice, while <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is...well, it's also that, but it's episodic, so the whole game hasn't yet seen the light of day.</p><p>Black Tabby is working to rectify that, however. <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>'s fifth episode is due to arrive on February 13th (that's next Friday at time of writing), and per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1609230/view/499470950023038028" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">progress update</a> on Steam, the episode currently "contains roughly 300,000 words", although much of that will be confined to branching paths.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked <em>Slay the Princess </em>out yet, it's a visual novel that combines distinctive pencil sketch-like art with a recursive narrative about, well, slaying a princess.</p><p>I don't want to spoil the game's many surprises, but suffice it to say there's more going on under the surface than that, so if you haven't yet, you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/slay-the-princess---the-pristine-cut/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut/9PG84GGVTSQV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Just as the noise from the fan outcry about the disappointing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> finale</span></a><span> was starting to die down, another project from the Netflix sci-fi series is putting the Hawkins kids back in the limelight. </span><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85</span></i><span> is an animated series that takes place between the main series’ second and third seasons, and all things considered, it looks pretty good in its first trailer.</span></p> <p><span>Netflix has pegged the show as a more kid-friendly “Saturday morning cartoon” take on </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, and it definitely comes off that way based on the clips we’ve seen thus far. It’s colorful, packed with jokes, and even the evil creatures from the Upside Down are kinda cute in its </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>-esque art style. The main cast of characters are returning in the series, but they are notably not voiced by any of their live-action actors. All of them are grown now, so they probably couldn’t voice their younger selves anyway, and they definitely sound like kids in this first trailer, which you can view below:</span></p>

  <p><span>While the fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> created a whirlwind of controversy after some fans were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>disappointed in its conclusion</span></a><span>, even prompting some to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>spin a conspiracy theory</span></a><span> that a secret finale was coming that would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>address all their grievances</span></a><span>, maybe </span><i><span>Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>could serve as a low-stakes palate cleanser? I also wouldn’t be surprised, though, if the people who were that dissatisfied with season 5 just wash their hands of the series altogether and don’t watch the show. Which is valid. Live your truth, Byler shippers. Just, you know, be normal about it instead of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307"><span>harassing the creators of the show</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ‘85 </span></i><span>will premiere on Netflix on April 23.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Console boundaries are constantly shifting, especially concerning Xbox. It seems like most of their titles are playable on other platforms, and plenty of them are available as part of the Game Pass service.</p>







<p>When it comes to third-party titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, though, it’s not always a guarantee that they’ll appear on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass. If you were hoping to pick up Suda51’s latest title on Game Pass, then allow Insider Gaming to let you know if you stand a chance.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-romeo-is-a-dead-man-available-on-xbox">Is Romeo Is A Dead Man Available On Xbox?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Green like Xbox. Image by Grasshopper Manufacture.<br></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Romeo Is A Dead Man will be available to play on both Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Suda51’s titles have appeared on Xbox platforms in the past, so it’s not surprising that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-early-access/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/does-romeo-is-a-dead-man-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a> will be available on the Series X|S. With the latest and greatest consoles available, expect to see bloody and gory brilliance like Grasshopper Manufacture has never displayed before.</p>







<p>However, while it may be available on the console, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily appear on Xbox Game Pass. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-romeo-is-a-dead-man-coming-to-game-pass">Is Romeo Is A Dead Man Coming To Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Whilst Romeo Is A Dead Man will be playable on Xbox consoles, it won’t be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass service. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it may not launch on the service, that’s not to say that it will never be available there in the future. Xbox often pick up third-party titles after they’ve released and includes them as part of the deal—maybe Romeo Is A Dead Man could feature down the line?</p>

            <p>If you think we've had enough takes on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/harvest-moon">Harvest Moon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> formula, think again. Starsand Island is almost ready to invite players into a "peaceful paradise," and its looks alone could seal the deal for many lapsed farmers.</p>
<p>The game, teased again during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">the last Tokyo Game Show</a>, comes from Chinese developer Seed Sparkle Lab, who has decided to first drop it on Steam Early Access and Xbox Preview in order to "finalise the comprehensive content and finesse the end-game experience." After that period, which is supposedly ending in mid-2026, the game will hit 1.0 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">Steam</a>, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and even macOS.</p> <figure>

<p>On top of the striking cozy anime aesthetic covering it all, Starsand Island's secret weapon might be its bigger focus on side activities which aren't strictly related to running a farm and more open-ended building and customization options. NPC relationships and fluffy animal companions will play huge roles as well.</p>
<p>There's even vehicles like roller blades and hoverboards, with cars and motorbikes serving as bigger, more traditional means of transport. Online multiplayer won't be supported when the game hits early access on 11th February, but it's coming with the full release. In fact, the devs are encouraging cooperative crafting and construction through "extensive DIY" systems that aim to remove a few of the usual guard rails.</p><p>The developers have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starsandisland/comments/1kbfutr/why_we_created_starsand_island_every_choice/">quite open about the entire creative process</a> for months now, and that included <a href="https://imgur.com/PrlU0ZU">shooting down accusations of genAI use</a>. Our quick look at the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ErpRrv2jbm">official Discord server</a> has also revealed a strong anti-AI stance in its community, so at the time of writing, it <em>seems</em> free of slop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, I’d like to talk about Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>It has received high ratings, scoring over 80 on Metascore at “Metacritic” and earning an "Overwhelmingly Positive*1" rating on Steam's customer reviews. We recently announced that worldwide cumulative sales have surpassed 1 million units. However, initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year. We aim to sustain long-term sales by encouraging players to enjoy the game over time through the continued support of the title including ongoing release of additional downloadable content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega notes that its overall performance in the first half of the current fiscal year has been somewhat disappointing, citing lower-than-expected sales in the gaming division along with Rovio's performance in the entertainment sector.</p>
<p>The presentation highlights <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</a> as a major full game release for the fiscal year, but we suspect it will probably want a few more big-hitters as the wider industry grapples with uncertain economies and price hikes across the board.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Players in the United States have <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">GameStop</a></strong>, players in Canada have <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/"><strong>EB Games</strong>,</a> and players in the UK have <strong>GAME</strong> as their major gaming-dedicated retailers. Or at least, UK players did have GAME, as the retailer is set to close its last three remaining standalone GAME stores after it made creditors aware it would be entering administration, the UK phrase for declaring bankruptcy.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/frasers-owned-game-retail-signals-it-s-on-the-brink-of-collapse">Bloomberg</a> reported that GAME had entered administration, a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-has-happened-to-game-the-game">The Game Business</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-retailer-game-is-closing-its-remaining-standalone-stores-after-entering-administration/">VGC</a>) a few days later identified that the last three standalone GAME stores in the UK would be closed, as the company is once again on the brink of collapsing. It'll still operate its website, and players in the UK will still be able to visit locations that operate within larger Frasers Group-owned entities as concession stands, but it will no longer have standalone brick-and-mortar storefronts.</p>



<p>The British gaming retailer was acquired by the Frasers Group back in 2019, and over the years, the company has been cutting down on its services, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">ending trade-ins in January 2024</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-reportedly-dropping-in-store-pre-orders-next-month">ending in-store pre-orders in July 2024</a>. And in between those changes, it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-game-braced-for-redundancies">laid off a "<em>majority</em>" of staff in April 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Ending pre-orders and trade-ins may be unique to GAME, but retailers dedicated to games across the world have suffered store closures and layoffs, including the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">GameStop</a> and EB Games. Plenty of players still buy their titles physically, but most are buying them on the digital storefronts available on their device, whether that's Steam, the PlayStation Store, the Xbox Store or the Nintendo eShop.</p>



<p>The writing has been on the wall for retailers dedicated to gaming for years now, and with GAME set to close its remaining standalone stores, it's the closing of a chapter in the business of video games. Still, back in 2023, the company's managing director, <strong>Nick Arran</strong>, denied that it would be turning away from selling video games to focus instead on selling toys and other physical items.</p>



<p>"<em>Gaming is our core business and we will be last man standing selling physical video games</em>," Arran said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/game-we-will-be-the-last-man-standing-in-physical-video-games">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>We see our place in the market as proving that there is a place for physical, whether that be the collector's editions, which we see as the vinyl of video games, or the gifter who doesn't want to wrap up a download code for Christmas. But we need to be realistic. We have a business to run and the expectation is this will decline. So we need to fill that gap</em>."</p>



<p>Three years later, it's tough to see the British retailer as the "<em>last man standing</em>" as a gaming-dedicated store if it doesn't have any stores around. Its concessions will continue, but if the company keeps declining, those may be gone sooner than later as well.</p>
