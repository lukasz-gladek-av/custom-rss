			<p>Newzoo has released<a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/global-games-market-update-q1-2025?utm_campaign=5745787-2025-Newzoo-Press&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-__Dq-HWVzJK08jsx_6t5jYPEY6DxXW-ixoHYynq9c2ftlODIAJQBurdpm-hpCBe74HoSVI9UKPBo2ONoLUJYJ5h29KoQ&amp;_hsmi=350466789&amp;utm_content=350466789&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest report</a> and has also announced that it has implemented new changes that will make the reports more accurate than ever. The company is dedicated to refining its data products so that all information provided about the gaming industry is trustworthy and helps provide a true insight into the industry. This has been achieved by improved data integration with Newzoo's Game Performance Monitor, as well as new acquisitions where they acquired the Steam Data Suite, which is now known as Newzoo's Business Store Intelligence.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As a result of these new changes, Newzoo has created a new report that dives into the industry's global forecast and what comes next in terms of revenue and growth compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Comparing the industry to the last three years, it's set to recover as a whole, to a more mature "new normal." All three platforms (Console, Mobile, PC) are expected to return to growth. However, it won't be a massive amount of growth and will stay in the low single digits. Thus far, it's forecasted to be 3.7%.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The PC market is forecast to grow similarly to the mobile market in the sense that microtransactions, such as in-game cosmetics, loot boxes, and battle passes, will drive the revenue on that platform. Among the PC market, Fortnite and Roblox will continue to remain popular and get consistent engagement, with new content streams being released regularly. Growth in China specifically is expected to slow down, while Japan's popularity will continue to rise over this period.</p>
<p>While some may feel that consoles are dying out, Newzoo predicts that it will instead actually get a major boost, thanks to some upcoming major releases. This includes the highly-anticipated release of Grand Theft Auto VI that is set to release this year, which is triggering increased hardware upgrades. While the publishers aren't mentioned, those that are developing titles for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S expect that they will profit from the peak install base.</p>
<p>Thus far, console users are set to have a good amount of games releasing that will bring in a lot of revenue, including Grand Theft Auto VI. Most recently is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which has already proven to be incredibly popular. The Nintendo Switch 2 is also set to release this year, which means there will be some highly-anticipated games from audiences of all ages, including Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The mobile market has reached market maturity, where player growth has lowered significantly to below 3% annually outside of the typical growth regions. Eastern Asia has particularly low player growth compared to other regions.</p>

Must-haves include <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</em>, and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>(in that order). Nice-to-haves include <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em>, and <em>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</em>, an XCOM-like strategy game that improves on the already great <em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle </em>in almost every way.</p><p> Nintendo rarely puts its own high-profile Switch games on sale with better discounts than this, and the company has already confirmed they’ll be backwards compatible on Switch 2.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-has-%E2%80%98exciting-things-planned%E2%80%99-for-starfield-this-year-but-remains-silent.1127427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It seems like a lifetime since Starfield was released, but it wasn’t even two years ago that Bethesda Game Studios’ space-based RPG epic hit the market. For many, the game came and went without too much of an impact, and for others, it was the title of a lifetime, positively bursting at the seams with untold potential.</p>



<p>I’m probably in the former camp there.</p>



<p>Recently, the team posted on social media, expressing an appreciation for the patience of fans worldwide and stressing that there are exciting things in store for Starfield this year, but the squad is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-starfield-dlc-anyone">Next Starfield DLC, Anyone?</h2>



<p>In September, a year after Starfield was released, Bethesda published Shattered Space, the first (and so far, only) major expansion for the game. It wasn’t an overwhelming thing and it left some players feeling short-changed, but at least it was an evolution on the game that has kind of run stagnant over the last eighteen months or so.</p>



<p>The game that took 20 years to emerge fully seemed to run out of steam very early on, which wasn’t good.</p>



<p>If we look at some representative examples of how the world is treating Starfield, we can see that things aren’t looking too positive. On Twitch, the game peaked at 552,021 viewers when it was released, but as I write this, just 40 people are watching Starfield gameplay.</p>



<p>By contrast, Fallout 4 has 648 viewers, which isn’t much better, but that game is <strong>a decade old</strong>.</p>



<p>On Steam, Starfield’s player count has dropped by 99% since its release. Talking of Fallout 4, the post-apocalyptic RPG’s player count on the PC platform more than tripled Starfield’s count at the time of writing.</p>







<p>That’s part and parcel of the lifecycle of a single-player game, though – so I won’t be too harsh on Starfield for not bucking the trend.</p>



<p>Bethesda planned to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/">one major expansion</a> for Starfield every year, and given the track record for how early we heard about Shattered Space, we <strong>should </strong>have something on the board for the next expansion, but never mind. It has been almost six months since Shattered Space dropped, and we’re none the wiser.</p>



<p>But fear not! On <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios assured fans that all is well and that there’s something in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know you’re eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we’re not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can’t wait to talk about when the time is right. </p>



<p>We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s bear in mind that the folks at Bethesda haven’t given us a solid update on The Elder Scrolls 6 in almost a decade, so there’s that.</p>

"Based on our experiences talking with other streaming platforms, we were anticipating having to do a custom build, but we didn’t need to," he said.

Keeping costs down is the key to making streaming work from a business standpoint, so these efficiencies really add up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To further prove GameLift Streams' capabilities, Jackbox launched a SmartTV app. Longtime players can access their library from the app in a "more elegant and streamlined way," and newcomers without a console have an easier way to explore the developer's work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Amazon's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/scale-and-deliver-game-streaming-experiences-with-amazon-gamelift-streams/">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the GameLift Streams SDK integrates with a game's already existing services, storefronts, and launchers to enable streaming. Developers can use the SDK console to observe active streams and scale the infrastructure across multiple regions on the Amazon Web Services network. "GameLift Streams is the only solution that enables you to upload your game content onto fully-managed GPU instances in the cloud and start streaming in minutes," it reads, "with little or no modification of your code."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

March is here, meaning the first tentative whiff of spring is in the air. But also, another month means the usual refresh across gaming's various subscription services. And if you're a Prime Gaming member, you'll probably be wanting to know <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/bastion-uk/pressreleases/prime-gaming-march-content-update-3373841">Amazon's announced 20 more titles</a> coming to the service this month - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-ii">Mafia 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wolfenstein-the-old-blood">Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</a>.
</p>
<p>
March's offerings - as is customary for Prime Gaming - arrive over the course of several scheduled content drops, with four games available right now. There're some good 'uns in this initial list too, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/saints-row-the-third-remastered">Saints Row: The Third Remastered</a> and Mafia 2 (in its Definitive Edition guise) both available for your immediate amusement.
</p>
<p>
Then, glancing further ahead in March, Prime Gaming subscribers can look forward to an eclectic bunch of other winners, including Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (which is available for both PC and Xbox), acclaimed indie game Mutazione, and narrative adventure Syberia: The World Before. That's alongside ancient Rome mystery The Forgotten City, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-invisible-war">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a>, and charming park management game Let's Build a Zoo.
</p>
<p>
The full list of March's titles (plus the stores they can be grabbed from) are below.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">when Nvidia categorically told us</a> that “no other Nvidia GPUs” had shipped, or would be shipping, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">missing render units</a>? Well, you can imagine our surprise to read that the company’s RTX 50-series laptop GPUs might be affected as well, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/GeForce-RTX-5000-Auch-Notebook-GPUs-sind-vom-ROP-Schwund-betroffen-10306989.html">with <em>Heise Online</em></a> <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/65685-fehlende-rops-auch-mobile-geforce-rtx-50-gpus-betroffen.html">and <em>Hardwareluxx </em>reporting</a> that Nvidia has asked manufacturers to check their laptops for fewer ROPs than promised.</p></div><p>But Nvidia tells <em>The Verge</em> there isn’t actually a problem with those notebook GPUs. “All partners continue to run checks as part of our standard testing procedure,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells us, adding that Nvidia will reach out to both German publications to discuss.</p><p>We asked very specifically:</p><p><strong>Did we just go from “no other GPUs are affected” to ‘“some laptop GPUs” are also affected?</strong></p><p>The answer was “Nope.”</p><p><strong>Just to triple-check, the “nope” means that no laptop GPUs are affected by the missing ROP issue, yes? </strong></p><p>“Correct, no further issues,” says Berraondo.</p><p>That’s a fairly categorical denial, and it sounds like laptop buyers can expect to find the full complement of ROPs in their Nvidia 50-series laptops either way — either because there never was an issue to begin with or because there’s no longer an issue now that partners will catch it during these tests.</p><p>Both <em>Heise </em>and<em> Hardwareluxx</em> have suggested that these tests are unusual in one way: some laptops may be delivered in April or May instead of planned March release dates. However, <em>Heise</em> also reports one other possible reason for delays: that “Nvidia only recently distributed the final vBIOS for the notebook GPUs,” according to Google Translate.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Jackbox Games are going to be available on smart TVs as part of a new cloud streaming service, <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/jackbox-coming-to-your-smart-tv-for-free">according to a blog post</a>. Jackbox aims to launch a beta of the service on “one or two smart TV platforms in the Spring of 2025.”</p><p>Generally, Jackbox titles are offered in bundles called “Party Packs” that you can play on platforms like game consoles and PCs. This new native smart TV app could make it easier to jump into a Jackbox game, since you won’t need to launch the titles from a device like a game console.</p><p>To start, this Jackbox service will only offer a “small collection” of “ad-supported” games for free. But down the line, Jackbox plans to “also offer our entire catalog of games for a subscription fee.” (You can already subscribe to <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/subscription/jackbox-games/B09R97C6ZG">a Jackbox Games channel</a> on Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service for $4.99 per month to access the Jackbox catalog.)</p><p>Jackbox’s service relies on Amazon’s new AWS GameLift Streams technology that lets companies build their own cloud gaming apps and experiences. GameLift Streams is also being used by companies like Bandai Namco, which relies on it to “stream an immersive metaverse platform to fans of its Gundam franchise,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250305783339/en/Amazon-GameLift-Streams-Empowers-Developers-to-Stream-Games-to-Virtually-Any-Device/">according to a press release</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nacon held its Nacon Connect 2025 event on Thursday, and with it came the reveal of a new sequel to RoboCop: Rogue City called RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business.</p>



<p>Releasing this summer, RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business is a “stand-alone follow-up” to 2023’s game that will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>“The OmniTower is their fortress, violence is their language. Face off against elite mercenaries all the way to the top of the tower and uphold the law amidst chaos!,” the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>It continues: “When a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress, RoboCop must take action and put a stop to their plans to undermine law and order.”</p>



<p>Nacon says that players will have new threats in the OmniTower with every floor being “riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops.”</p>



<p>“Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man,” the publisher said.</p>



<p>Additional details including features, system specs, release date and more will be revealed in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Check out the reveal trailer for the RoboCop: Rogue City sequel  yourself. And let us know what you think down below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>While traveling throughout Mio and Zoe's fictional worlds, you might notice benches spread across the levels. There are <strong>six benches</strong> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> in total, and resting on all of them will give you an insight into their worlds in the form of a short conversation. It'll also give you the Sisters: A Tale of Two Besties achievement, so they're worth seeking out if you're trying to get all of the trophies. Both girls must sit on the bench for it to count, and you'll know it's successful if the cameras pan together and the conversation begins.</p><p>Below we've laid out <strong>all six benches in Split Fiction</strong> and precisely where to find them. Plan ahead with our guide as some of these can be easily missed or cut off by triggering cutscenes or parts of a level.</p><h2 id="Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</h2><p>The first bench is near the pool section, which is also the same area as the Mountain Hike side story. After landing on the hotel roof, head to the back and use the zipline to get to the next balcony across. On the left you'll see the bench. If you jump onto the passing car to progress the level, you can't go back, so make sure to seek this out before you go too far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454932"></a><figcaption>Neon Revenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><p>Before completing the Ice King palace puzzle, it's time to look for this level's bench.

                <p>When Activision revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4/" data-ref-id="5000-666086">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this week, the company didn't get into specifics about whether or not the two-minute time-limit structure from the older games will carry forward to the re-release. Now, developer Iron Galaxy has cleared up the situation.</p><p>The original Pro Skater 3 included a two-minute time limit to complete a level's challenges, but this was removed in Pro Skater 4; players could freely explore levels and complete missions at their own pace for its career mode. When Activision announced the re-release of 3+4 this week, many wondered if there would be a time limit in Pro Skater 4, with confusion stemming from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product pages that mentioned a "two-minute format."</a></p><p>GameSpot understands that THPS 3+4 will have a shared feature set that aims to unify the two games. Objectives for players to complete will be based on a timer for both games. That said, the game has a Free Skate mode with no timer at all. The game also has Speed Run and Single Session modes.</p><p>Basically, this means the setup in THPS 3+4 is different from the original version of Pro Skater 4. The Free Skate mode in THPS 3+4 does not let you complete challenges in the same way that players could in Pro Skater 4's Career mode.</p><p>THPS 3+4 launches on July 11 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC--it'll also be on Game Pass at launch. People who pay more money can start playing three days early, starting July 8.

                <p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, and with no end in sight, members of the SAG-AFTRA union held their first picket of 2025 this week and further discussed why the issue of AI is so critical.</p><p>Resident Evil Village actor and member of the negotiating committee Andi Norris told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-picket-1236328677/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that picketing paused for a period due to the Los Angeles wildfires and "everything that the world is dealing with" currently. But picketers returned to the WB Games offices in Burbank, California this week, with Norris said the aim is to ensure that people understand that the voice actors are "still fighting."</p><p>According to the report, the two sides have come to terms on 24 of 25 items, with the one outstanding issue being protections against generative AI.</p><p>Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Spider-Man in Insomniac's game series, said he wants the game companies to ensure actors that the voice data they've recorded cannot be used to "manufacture a performance that we had no say over." Lowenthal also stressed how compensation is a critical element in the ongoing negotiations, saying, "If you're going to do something like that, then we deserve a piece of that."</p><p>Another actor, <a href="https://scottlambright.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scott Lambright</a>, said they expect the rise in AI to lead to a future where there are studios that use AI and studios that do not use AI. "It's going to create a gulf in quality between art made by passionate people and, I guess the term is <em>slop</em>," the actor said.</p><p>Before this, Mass Effect actor Jennifer Hale discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why AI is an "existential" issue</a> in the ongoing back-and-forth for the strike.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with work stoppage spanning 18 months. Hale was involved in those discussions, too, and she said a key difference between the strike of 2016 and 2024/2025 is that the two sides had productive side bars without attorneys involved.</p><p>"My understanding is that in this particular negotiation up until very, very recently, they haven't been allowed to talk to each other. They can each talk to their attorney, and then the attorneys talk to each other. And until you have the people with the vested interest having the conversations, all that's happening is billable hours are going up," she said, referring to attorney fees.</p><p>The picket this week at WB Games comes not long after that company announced dramatic changes, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">cancellation of a Wonder Woman game, layoffs, and the closure of three studios.</a></p>

		<p>Nacon and Cyanide Studios have revealed Styx: Blades of Greed, a new sequel in the sneaky goblin stealth action series. The game is set to launch across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in autumn 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="(PEGI) Styx: Blades of Greed | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRb9E2ULlEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A third game in the Styx series, the titular goblin assassin is returning eight years after his last stealthy self-serving mission in Styx: Shards of Darkness. Where it was all about infiltrating a “good” guy fort to access their boundless supply of Amber last time out, Styx is now after the new mystical powers provided by quartz.</p>
<p>Through the announcement trailer we see him putting this to use, in combination with returning abilities and gadgets. With the inquisition hunting for him, he can use a little mind control to turn allies against each other, use environmental objects for kills, place poison gas bomb traps for guards to trigger, and slow enemies down to make for a hasty escape. Naturally, Styx is quipping and grouching all the way throughout.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this game has advanced over the first two entries. They were both dependable, if fairly straightforward stealth action games that admittedly didn’t quite have the depth and nuance that you’d hope for from the PS4 and Xbox One era of games. With a jump to a newer game engine and the current generation of consoles, I hope that there’s also an increase in gameplay quality, and not just a spruce up of the visuals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review/">Looking back at the last game</a>, I said, “Shards of Darkness could have been a big step forward for the series, giving you a more rounded set of gameplay possibilities, alongside the better looking environments and other areas. Alas it’s not as big an improvement as I’d hoped and is let down by bugs and inconsistencies. It’s a stealth game with one foot stuck in the past, and that remains both a blessing and a curse.”</p>

		<p>Nacon and ACE Team, the makes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/27/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-review/">Clash: Artifacts of Chaos</a> and Zeno Clash, have revealed The Mount: Omen of Cthulhu, a first person horror with up to four player online co-op. The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu | Reveal Trailer (UK | PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tD4pvmQPETY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Cast as a squad of conquistadors exploring an underound city in an eerie jungle setting, your search for priceless treasure becomes a fight for survival as otherworldly, Lovecraftian horrors distort your senses and threaten your sanity. Sounds could be from your mind playing tricks, you could hallucinate an ally as an enemy creature, and more. You’ll have to try and work as a team to get deeper and deeper into the jungle and somehow make it out alive.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re horribly under-equipped to deal with this kind of terror. Instead of having the machine guns and flamethrowers that you might want, you have to make do with swords, lanterns, axes and muskets. You will have voice chat to your fellow conquistadors, at least.</p>
<p>It’s a big change of pace for ACE Team, whose most recent work was a Zeno Clash revival in Clash: Artifacts of Chaos. That game was all about third person brawling, by way of the Soulslike genre, and coming with a fantastic art style. Before that, the team released a trio of Rock of Ages ball-tumbling puzzlers, and the thoroughly bizarre survival game Eternal Cylinder.</p>

<p>What seems to be a straight-up four person survival horror game might just be their most conventional game yet, but we’re looking forward to seeing the individualistic spin they will inevitably put on proceedings. the snippets of alpha gameplay footage at the end of the trailer certainly backed up the twisted, shifting nature of the slickly produced cinematic that preceded it.</p>
<p>Definitely one to keep an eye on for fans of recent co-op horrors like Phasmophobia, The Outlast Trials, and Lethal Company.</p>

		<p>The first gaming accessory from Nacon’s Racing department, the Revosim RS Pure, will launch in June 2025 and is now available for pre-order.</p>
<p><iframe title="REVOSIM | Live-Action Pre-Order Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NmDUzo6pXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/31/nacon-announces-new-revosim-direct-drive-racing-wheels/">Announced last May</a>, the Revosim RS Pure is a 9Nm Direct Drive gaming wheel, meeting the core technological standards and expectations of what a high-end racing wheel should provide. Along with the motor, the wheel itself then features imitation leather, and there’s aluminium pedals to get a premium, high-end finish. There’s also a built-in smartphone mount to allow for app connected telemetry and a heads up display.</p>
<p>The RS Pure is the first piece of the puzzle for a broader Revosim line up, getting the foundational wheel and pedals set released first before additional peripherals arrive, which will include a handbrake, gear shifter and clutch pedal. The wheel is compatible with Windows PC only.</p>
<p>The wheel will have <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en/bundle-steering-wheel-base-dd-9nm-pedal-rs-pure">support for the following games at launch</a>, with app telemetry support “in development” across the board</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en/accessories/revosim">Preorders are now live</a> with the full package of wheelbase, wheel and pedals coming in at €799.90. The wheelbase can be had separately for €550, wheel for €200, wheelbase and wheel for €700, and pedals for €150 – I trust that you can all mentally subtract 10 cents from each price there.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/hands-on-the-revosim-pure-nacons-first-high-end-racing-wheel/">hands on with the Revosim RS Pure at Gamescom 2024</a>, saying that “Fundamentally, the Revosim Pure just seems to be a nice all-round basis for Nacon to build out their racing wheel range from, and a solid alternative to the big names already in the racing wheel market.”</p>
