<p>Team Spirit’s rising star (if you don’t count him as arisen yet, anyway), Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, has penned his name even deeper into the Counter-Strike history books at the Starladder Budapest Major. The young competitor threw out a stunning performance on Train against Team Liquid in the third (ongoing) stage of the Major in Hungary.</p>



<p>The Russian rifler opened up the clash with a pistol ace, setting a dominant tone and sending viewers wild. That performance persisted throughout the unravelling of the map, and by the time the dust had settled, donk had racked up his <strong>best map performance ever </strong>at a CS2 Major.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-a-new-benchmark-for-donk-and-everyone-else">A New Benchmark for Donk – And Everyone Else</h2>



<p>By the end of regulation against Team Liquid, donk had amassed a whopping 30 kills and only 11 deaths, but that’s just where these stunning stats <strong>begin</strong>. His HLTV rating came out at 2.38, the highest of his Major run thus far, and he was considered a huge force of momentum for Team Spirit’s win.</p>



<p>This Train performance surpassed his previous benchmark, which he set on Mirage against Imperial at the Copenhagen Major in 2024.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Donk’s pistol ace in Budapest is an easy notch on his belt, and it’s yet another clipped onto his total run of aces at the Majors he has attended. In Shanghai in 2024, the young competitor put up a massive <strong>four aces in a single tournament</strong>, which included an awe-inspiring 1v5 slam.</p>



<p>Team Spirit closed out the map against Team Liquid with a 13:8 victory, pushing further through the third stage of the Starladder Budapest Major.</p>



<p>For donk, this was more than just another win; it was another career-defining moment that showcases his consistency and ability to deliver. Right now, it’s obvious to see why many regard him as a growing GOAT of Counter-Strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#908)—Clues and Answers for Friday, December 5]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-5-908/</link>
            <guid>1373584</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and while that means the weekend is within spitting distance, it also means that you’ve got a whole new NYT Connections puzzle to dominate today. Fortunately, I’ve arrived with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to get the puzzle resolved as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to get the notes and hints you need to wrap up today’s NYT Connections puzzle without too much fuss.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #908:</p>



<ul>
<li>SORRY</li>



<li>TOUGH</li>



<li>DEAL</li>



<li>BABY</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>STICKY</li>



<li>PILLOW</li>



<li>STORY</li>



<li>MASTERMIND</li>



<li>SMALL</li>



<li>DELICATE</li>



<li>OPERATION</li>



<li>COMPLEX</li>



<li>STATUS</li>



<li>MOUSE TRAP</li>



<li>SITUATION</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of situations or problems that aren’t straightforward.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>These are terms you’d use when describing “how things stand” in a given moment.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are titles you’d recognize from family game nights or childhood play.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – E<em>ach of these words pairs naturally with “talk” to form a familiar expression.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 5:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-5-908">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 5 (#908)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– COMPLEX, DELICATE, STICKY, TOUGH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEAL, SITUATION, STATUS, STORY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – MASTERMIND, MOUSE TRAP, OPERATION, SORRY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BABY, PILLOW, SMALL, SWEET</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

While players continue to develop their settlement, story-driven quests, time-sensitive expeditions, and dynamic fog surges can shift entire strategies in a moment.</p><p>The main antagonist is an enigmatic fog, which impacts citizens’ health and morale, and is modeled using custom voxel grid technology, creating dynamic and unpredictable fog shifts. A once-thriving society faced a life-threatening enemy when this mysterious mist swept across the lands, warping their minds and consuming everything. In a desperate attempt for survival, those who still stood fled upwards towards the treetops, and rebuilt their homes above the deadly haze. The game’s heavy atmosphere is paired with ambisonic audio cues that intensify the sense of dread, all woven together by the haunting compositions of legendary musician Akira Yamaoka.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

It will launch in 2026. <span id="more-1011184"></span></p><p>“With deep inspiration from not only video games like <em>Into the Breach</em>, but also tabletop <a title="Genres > Board Game [63 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/board-game">board games</a> such as <em>Mansions of Madness</em>, <em>Neath</em> is a game we’ve been wanting to make for years,” said Cellar Door Games co-founder and lead programmer Kenny Lee in a press release. “Development has taken us far from our comfort zone, working in an unfamiliar genre with an aesthetic much darker than what we usually do. But we’ve got a lot of new ideas, from ‘engagement locking’ to the ‘attack resolve system’, and we’re excited to see if we can move this burgeoning genre in a whole new direction. PRAISE NEATH!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3749830/Neath/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Praise Neath.</p><p>Lead a band of fragile warriors through a colossal, inverted tower, where Taboos, the everchanging edicts of a God, warp the laws of reality.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Neath</em> is a roguelike tactical RPG set in a decaying world shadowed by an irradiated, inverted tower. Using a fluid turn-based system where the turn order is always shifting, you dictate the actions of both friend and foe alike. As enemies engage you they will freeze your teammates in fear. Disrupt opponents by knocking them away, shove allies far from impending harm, or make the ultimate sacrifice and have someone else take the blow in their stead.</p><p>As you ascend the corrupt citadel to defy the decree of the undivine, your journey will twist and turn with encounters shown through a classic 90’s dungeon-crawler style. Unlock new abilities and challenges that ensure every expedition is unique, and unravel a dark mystery before you succumb to the horrors within.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011525"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Control Every “Moment”</strong> – A unique “engagement-locking” system grips your teammates in fear when they are targeted by enemies, and you must disrupt your foes to save them. In <em>Neath</em> there are no heroes. Work together to survive, or stand alone and fall.</li><li><strong>Ascend the Inverted Tower</strong> – Face your fears as you ascend the ever-changing inverted tower of Neath in a roguelike tactical <a title="Genres > RPG [17,832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> where every run is unique.</li><li><strong>Defy <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a></strong> – Make trapped chests fizzle, barter with the gods, and reshape destiny with the power of Fate’s Die.

But beware the consequences when playing games with providence.</li><li><strong>Ever-Changing Encounters</strong> – Build your party throughout the run to learn new abilities and uncover ancient, powerful relics. Build esoteric synergies that will have you poisoning the air with rotting stench, or striking blows that send enemies hurtling across the room.</li><li><strong>Shape Your Settlement</strong> – Build up the lowly town of Shale to better prepare you to climb deeper into the depths of the tower. Distribute your serfdom to prioritize skills that adjust your playstyle before every run.</li><li><strong>Praise Neath</strong> – The Taboos must be honoured. The Taboo must be obeyed. Tithe the gods; say their name. Laws may change, but the punishment remains the same. Praise Neath.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 doesn’t stand up to Nintendo’s best]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/838428/metroid-prime-4-analysis-open-world-nintendo</link>
            <guid>1373539</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> is finally out after a long and difficult development — and despite some bright spots, the game really shows its age.</p><p>Nintendo has a long and celebrated history of doing things its own way. During the original Switch era, going back to<em> Super Mario Odyssey</em> in 2017, Nintendo has focused on bringing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/707449/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-design-open-world">open-world style exploration elements</a> to many of its major releases. That strategy has worked very well, breathing new life into storied franchises like <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. But it hasn’t quite added the same revolutionary touch to <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p><p>In all of the other games that got the open-world-style treatment, those elements were additive to the experience. Exploring vast stretches of Hyrule in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, for example, inevitably led to some kind of new discovery — a shrine to crack, a korok to uncover, or a treasure to find. We had never seen Hyrule rendered like that on a Nintendo console, and it was neat to traipse about it and take it all in.</p><p>In <em>Beyond</em>, though, that kind of exploration is more of a chore than a treat. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">In his review</a>, Andrew Webster described the desert hub world Samus travels through as “a bare and boring place.” There are things to discover, but they’re no more than mile markers on a long stretch of desert.</p><p>The problem is that for the type of game <em>Metroid</em> is, free-roaming exploration doesn’t work, or at least not in this execution. In the early hours of <em>Beyond</em>, while zipping across the desert on the extremely cool-looking VI-O-LA bike, I encountered a wrecked structure belching smoke. After taking care of a few enemies, I looked around to see if there was any puzzle to solve or treasure to take, only to find nothing. There seemed to be <em>something</em> higher up that I could interact with, but I couldn’t reach it. So I left.</p><p>A Metroidvania gates progression behind power-ups. When you encounter a roadblock, that’s typically your signal to come back later. That works in a closed environment like the biomes of Viewros, the new planet Samus explores, but it kills momentum in an open world because there’s no guaranteed payoff for your time. It makes the world feel emptier in a way it didn’t for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. In those games, I knew that my noodling would net me something more than bug gunk all over my sleek biker suit power armor. I could probably return to that crash site when I have whatever required power, but I don’t feel compelled to go back.</p><p>I’m also really annoyed with <em>Beyond</em>’s illusion of choice. In your first time zooming across the desert, a colleague named Mackenzie, speaking with an authority that sounds like a message to the player from the developers, says that you can go wherever you want next. But when I did that, I immediately hit a wall of fire I could not pass. It felt like the developers were playing a prank on me, like, “lol, we <em>said</em> you could go anywhere but we really want you to come back when you have the right stuff.” <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> wouldn’t do me like that.</p><p>Another element that demonstrates just how late Nintendo is to the party is the companions. They are all too quick to tell Samus what to do, where to go, and what she’s doing wrong. That kind of guideposting was and still is all the rage in big-budget action-adventure games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14665114/horizon-zero-dawn-review-ps4"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, and it can be helpful when you get stuck. But part of <em>Metroid</em>’s appeal is using your wits and skills to figure shit out on your own.</p><div><p>I don’t need you to show me how to get back to Fury Green. I’ve been there several times already! </p></div><p>All that goes out the window, though, when Mackenzie, your primary companion, chimes in with tips unannounced and unasked for, condescending to both me and Samus. Samus Aran is the baddest bounty hunter this side of Zebes, a fact everyone around her acknowledges except when it’s time for her to do the very things they all rightfully venerate her for. No, Mackenzie, I don’t need you to show me how to get back to Fury Green. I’ve been there several times already!</p><div><p>Nintendo’s biggest mistake with <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, though, is that it feels too much like the original <em>Metroid Prime </em>trilogy. Perhaps the most impressive thing about Nintendo’s other recent major mascot titles is that they all share the same basic structure of their predecessors, but have some new twist that makes the old feel new. With <em>Odyssey</em>, it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">Cappy’s transformation powers</a>. In<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em>, it was the Ultrahand powers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024">working in tandem with the physics engine</a> to create <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23734533/zelda-totk-controls-weapons-fuse-rewiring-brain">unique emergent gameplay experiences</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23737921/tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-physics-game-devs-explain/">that felt magical</a>. In <em>Bananza</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">the simplicity of being able to break nearly everything on screen</a> did the same.</p></div><p>Nintendo gave you weird, often simple tools and let you loose on the world, and it resulted in some of the best games the company has ever made. There’s none of that in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. The psychic powers Samus gets are mere remixes of powers she’s had before. A psychic lasso is just a spicy grapple beam.</p><p><em>Beyond</em> isn’t without merit, because there’s still nothing quite like the <em>Prime</em> brand of 3D exploration. But it seems that eight years and a development reboot should yield something more impressive than this, especially considering the treatment Nintendo has given its other franchises. In <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, the old doesn’t feel new, and the new doesn’t feel good.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/838428/metroid-prime-4-analysis-open-world-nintendo]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you were Senior Floor Manager of Earth, and a weird planet innocently appeared on the fringe of our solar system, what would you do? I would probably not zip out there and plant a factory on that planet, in much the same way that I wouldn’t high-five a bear-shaped shadow on the edge of a campsite. But I am not the modder behind beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> mod Ultracube, who is now part of game developer Dubious Design.</p>
<p>The latter have just announced the very Factorio-esque Substructure, which is being published by Hooded Horse. A new Hooded Horse joint tends to get a certain automatic level of attention round these parts. We’re partial to factory sims, too. Substructure seals the deal by sort of being a horror game as well. I mean, they’re not actually calling it that, but it seems creepy as balls. The trailer below sees whole segments of production line sinking below the surface like Atlantis.</p>

<p>It’s a factory sim in which you slowly colonise the layers of the aforesaid weird planet, constructing new production lines on each level. As players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> will know, striking the earth tends to make it strike back, but there <em>is</em> a lot of cool stuff down there you can use for upgrades. Please do your best to get hold of that stuff, while avoiding the stuff that has teeth.</p><p>You can expect both the routine smokestacks and industrialised agriculture, which makes for a relatively picturesque factory sim. You can program the elevators, though the press release doesn’t go into details, and there’s co-op too. As you’d expect given the dev’s pedigree, the press release makes a big deal of the mod support. “From day one, add new resources, buildings, or just balance the game as desired!” it trills.</p>
<p>You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012600/Substructure">Steam</a>. A little more on the Dubious Design: they’re based in the UK, and consist of two people. “May the future be dubious,” the developers declare in announcement materials. I like the energy, but I would like the future to at least contain an early access release date.</p>

<p>You're a person in a big spiky car with guns or missiles. The folks you're racemurdering as you drive around are also in big spiky cars with guns or missiles. One of these 15 big spiky cars with upgradeable guns or missiles is a not-quite VW camper van dubbed "Iron Lady". Finally, a chance for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/send-thatcher-back-to-hell-in-this-new-doom-2-mod-today">Margaret Thatcher's evil powers</a> to be used for good.</p>
<p>"By day, the skyline smolders; by night, zombie hordes - the Wasted - flood every avenue and turn them into kill-zones," reads the synopsis. "Your only way out is to win the Carmageddon: a chain of lethal underground races whose champion earns a shot at the last spaceport beyond the mountains."</p>
<p>Making that escape means fighting your way through roguelike runs of car murder, battling through districts bossed by the likes of "corrupted enforcers, supermutated Wasteds, and monstrous war machines". Between runs, you spend beatcoins on building the perfect combo of car, weapon, and perks. There are 13 different kinds of deathbringer, including shotguns, railguns, and lasers if you want to get all fancy. Progression's permanent, and it sounds as if you'll be reincarnated as a slightly stronger driver each time you pop your clogs.</p><p>Having taken in the trailer, it looks like it could offer me the sort of Wreckfesty rush I regularly crave, though that'll largely depend on how satisfying the cars handle and smash together. The weapons'll also need to be sufficiently weighty. As of writing, I've only ever given the demo of 34BigThings's Wipeouty spaceship racer Redout a go, and I recall that not quite scratching my itch as much as its classic inspiration in what was a very limited sample, to be fair.</p>
<p>Rogue Shift's certainly one I'll be keeping an eye on, though, because its premise sounds like it could be killer if executed as well as your average murdercampervan missile barrage.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641</link>
            <guid>1373527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I was running around somewhere in Golden Ridge,</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"> <i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i></a><span>’s second major location, when I dared to look up a question that had been tickling the back of my brain for several hours: Does </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> have an inventory carry capacity limit?</span></p> <p><span>I was afraid to learn the answer. The odds that it was what I wanted to hear were not in my favor. What I wanted is practically unheard of in Western-style action role-playing games. But there were encouraging signs from the first dozen or so hours of my initial playthrough that this time might be a rare exception. I’d made it through Paradise Island, the game’s first open area, without sparing a thought about how much loot I was carrying. I couldn’t find the genre-typical “infinite home base storage chest” anywhere on my ship. I scoured the game’s inventory menu for tiny numbers I might have missed with a more casual glance. Nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Cautiously, I typed my question into a search engine. And there it was, the answer I hadn’t dared hope for: No, it doesn’t. I could steal as much superfluous crap from the various corpses, human and animal alike, I left in my wake as I wanted; I could stuff my pockets with all the wild plants, spare mechanical bits, and errant severed arms I came across and I’d never have to schlep it all the way back to a settlement or my ship to sell or store everything just to clear some space so I could pick up more junk and do it all over again. I could simply hoard it all, every tiny piece of trash and bulky piece of armor, and never have to worry about weight limits. It was exactly what I wanted. And by the time the credits finally rolled, I had come to hate it.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650644" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650644"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650644">Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In early role-playing video games, inventory limits and encumbrance were necessary due to the limited memory and file sizes of cartridges and discs. Annoying but understandable. But many modern action RPGs still have inventory limits even when they aren’t a technical necessity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some game designers point to realism as an explanation; as</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-the-kotaku-review-1703766283"> <i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i></a><span> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/encumbrance-sucks-so-why-is-it-still-so-common/"> <i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, “Having a limit to how much equipment Geralt can carry plays a part in making the character and the world around him more believable.” It’s possible to take this too far, though, as</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-says-it-plans-to-fix-fallout-76-s-item-storage-1830321275"> <i><span>Fallout 76</span></i></a><span> and</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-news-iv-inventory-bag-management-1850722800"> <i><span>Diablo 4</span></i></a> <span>proved with their way-too-small carry capacities. </span><span>No one wants to spend more time rummaging through inventory screens than gleefully chopping off monsters’ heads.</span></p>

 <p><span>The realism argument makes sense, but I’ve never found it especially compelling. I grew up almost exclusively playing point-and-click adventure video games where reading and critical thinking were a major part of the gameplay, and when I finally made the jump to action RPGs, I was immediately taken by them because of how gloriously constant, quick, and varied the dopamine hits were. I didn’t have to wait for the payoff of sometimes tedious puzzles or long-winded interrogations. I could just run around, pick something up, and marvel at the new thing I had, whether it was useful to me or not.</span></p>

 <p><span>I was enamored with these types of games because of how open they were, how few limits there were on what I could do or how I could solve a problem. That’s why I’ve always found inventory limits such a huge point of frustration. It’s not going to break immersion for me if my character has some sort of magical, unspecified access to all their equipment while moving around in the world. Thinking about how much equipment my character could realistically carry and where they would store all of it is not integral to my role-playing experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>If anything, forcing me to stop and manage my inventory is </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> immersion-breaking for the type of gameplay I’m seeking. I’ll only craft something if I can’t find a strong enough stock weapon, and I’ll only visit a vendor if I need to sell something. Games with encumbrance systems always force me to do at least one of those two things. They add busy work without interesting trade-offs. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> let me skip that entirely.</span></p> <p><span>Tim Cain, co-director of the original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-will-rattle-your-idea-of-a-perfect-pla-1839238442"><i><span>Outer Worlds</span></i></a><span>, which was released in 2019, looks at carrying capacity limits from a more practical perspective. As he told</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-game-designers-handle-the-burden-of-encumbrance"> <i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, “[Without encumbrance,] You end up with enormous inventory sizes and there’s the issue of well, how do you manage that? And there’s different ways. You can say ‘Well, we’ll limit how much they can pick up,’ but you’ve now done encumbrance. You’ve just given it a hard limit. Or you can say, ‘We’ll break things down into categories or we’ll let things stack,’ but then you’ve just introduced all these extra issues of now you have pages of inventory or categories, or stacks of items.”</span></p> <p><span>Notably, </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> does limit how much stuff a player can carry around with them, but offers unlimited storage on their ship, which is a pretty common compromise for inventory systems in RPGs, but which is still, to my mind, an absolute pain in the ass. I wasn’t the only one relieved to see the sequel ditch it. “</span><span>Honestly it’s kinda a breath of fresh air not having to worry,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og5wps/anyone_else_happy_and_surprised_theres_no/"><span>wrote</span></a><span> one player praising the decision on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og5wps/comment/nle7o49/"><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> subreddit</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650643" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650643"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650643">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Somewhere around three-quarters of the way through </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, a block of text popped up on my screen. My employer, the Earth Directorate, had found a flaw in me. I had used a single heavy machine gun for so long without switching weapons that the game was calling me out via one of its most unique and compelling mechanics: the flaw system, which triggers when you meet certain gameplay conditions and offers you a significant boost in exchange for a permanent debuff. </span></p> <p><span>This time, it offered me a bonus to armor penetration in exchange for losing my second weapon slot, which is, I think, a pretty good deal, but I was annoyed that the game had correctly identified a deep-seated insecurity that I have, which is that, left to my own devices, I am a bad and lazy gamer, so I quickly turned it down and tried unsuccessfully to put it out of my mind.</span></p>

 <p><span>After that, out of spite, I started sneaking around and bopping unsuspecting enemies over the head with a frightfully high-damage telescoping baton that had the added bonus of being topped with the head of the Auntie’s Choice Moon Man mascot to add a bit of whimsy to the proceedings. As much as I hated to admit it, it was pretty fun. And then I started investigating what else I was missing out on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, my beloved heavy machine gun was pretty good when it came to damage, but its ammo capacity was relatively small. Maybe I could craft a mod that could change that? Once I started interacting with those systems, I finally realized how much I had been floating through the game without really engaging with it and how detrimental that experience had been compared to playing RPGs that imposed limits. I was just running around, picking up stuff I’d never use, and telling myself I’d sort it out later, which I never did.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650647">Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>By the time I finished </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, I was carrying 142 weapons, 110 pieces of armor, and 98 helmets. Many of those were duplicates: I had an egregious seven identical copies of a single uniform that I hadn’t worn once. I’d put on a wonderfully daffy-looking helmet and robes I found in a hidden cache on Golden Ridge somewhere around the midpoint of the game and wore them straight through to the end because they were good enough and looking at them made me giggle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I collected the 25 unique tossball cards I needed to get access to a vendor’s exclusive inventory and then didn’t buy any of it because I didn’t want to bother learning what each item could do. Consequently, I never got to experience the admittedly gimmicky but still very cool effect of putting on one of that vendor’s helmets and</span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/outer-worlds-2-new-point-of-view-mk2/"> <span>having the game’s graphics turn into pixel art</span></a><span>. Many of the game’s most unique, bizarre, and delightful weapons sat untouched in my inventory because I’d chosen the path of least resistance. It didn’t feel good.</span></p> <p><span>I keep thinking about what my experience playing </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> would have been like if carrying a lot of stuff was a flaw. Maybe the game would tell me I’m a pack-rat, decrease the price vendors are willing to pay me for anything I sell them, and increase the chance of finding weapons and armor with a mod already installed. I’d probably turn it down—and then head off to the nearest shop to sell all my duplicates and finally start thinking about the way I interact with the game again.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation may have leaked the official release date of Romeo is a Dead Man. The leak comes only a day before the game’s dedicated presentation by the developer.</p>



<p>Revealed during June 2025’s State of Play, the action-packed Romeo is a Dead Man is the next title from Grasshopper Manufacture. Led by No More Heroes creator Suda51, it looks like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romeo-is-a-deadman-avoiding-firm-release-date-because-of-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a wild thrill ride</a>, fitting for the creator and his resume. The bloody action title was met with positive reactions from fans and critics after an initial preview. A presentation regarding the game is set for December 5th, but it seems PlayStation might have leaked one of the big announcements: its release date.</p>







<h2 id="h-romeo-is-a-dead-man-releasing-in-february-playstation-leak-states">Romeo is a Dead Man Releasing in February, PlayStation Leak States</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Romeo is a Dead Man release date leak comes from <strong>PlayStation itself and the PlayStation app</strong>. It was first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1996636997373644861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HazzadorGaming on Twitter/X</a>. When you click on the game on the app, instead of the 2026 or ‘Just Announced’ filler used for the icon, it says <strong>February 11th, 2026</strong>. Furthermore, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation store</a> <strong>mentions the date as well</strong>, giving more leeway to it. However, it’s important to note that is is not official yet, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>It’s likely PlayStation jumped the gun on the reveal, which would’ve likely been revealed at the presentation. The ‘Grasshopper Direct’ is only five minutes and solely focused on Romeo is a Dead Man. Regardless, fans will still see new gameplay and such, so not all has been spoiled. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> slowly approaching, hopefully, no other games will get release date leaks. Even still, this does mean that, if true, players can add Romeo is a Dead Man to their 2026 must-plays.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time since 2015, there’s a brand new Carmageddon game. Developer 34BigThings has officially announced Carmageddon: Rogue Shift, the fifth game in the 28-year-old franchise.</p>



<p>The announcement came as part of Thursday’s PC Gaming Show.</p>







<p>According to the developer, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift “blends the signature metal-on-metal carnage of the classic series with modern roguelite depth and silky arcade handling.”</p>



<p><strong>“We are bringing something fresh to the franchise and the racing genre,” </strong>game director Giuseppe Enrico Franchi said. <strong>“Carmageddon means explore, experiment, paint the streets red and crumple up opponents. We want our players to adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on zombie hordes with glee behind the wheel of a killing machine.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Rogue Shift will hit with those who fondly remember the legendary series, and those who are discovering it for the first time – reignited, reinvented and more thrilling than ever.”</strong></p>



<p>While no release date has been announced yet, it was confirmed that the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It’ll also be available for GeForce NOW subscribers.</p>

Adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on post‑apocalyptic zombie hordes. The legacy lives on, reinvented and unforgiving.</p><p><strong>The Long Night</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The year is 2050, and the world you know is a post‑apocalyptic wasteland.</p><p>Hordes of nightmare creatures, the Wasted, lay siege to humanity. Every night, the streets are overrun, forcing everyone to barricade themselves in their skyscraper-homes for <a title="Genres > Survival [489 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</p><p>There is just one chance to escape all this: the Carmageddon.</p><p>These deadly races promise power, prestige, and valuable prizes to the participants. Most importantly, the champion wins the right to attempt the perilous journey that leads to the spaceport beyond the mountains. The only one left, the only chance to flee this dying world.</p><p>You enter the <em>Carmageddon</em> as one of countless racers, equipped with little more than a rust bucket, scavenged fuel, and a makeshift weapon. You’ll face off against rival gangs like the Autoscum and other rogues in a fight for survival. Each destruction race is an opportunity to win parts and upgrades, a step towards the ultimate escape.</p><p>As the night descends, the Wasted take the streets, and you with them.</p><p><strong>Drive to Survive</strong></p><p>The original <em>Carmageddon</em> spirit of vehicular mayhem has been refined and redesigned. We looked at the past and the present to create a visceral, fast and accessible form of combat racing.</p><ul><li><strong>15 Upgradeable Vehicles</strong> – FWD, RWD, and AWD, each with unique weight and suspension</li><li><strong><a title="Platforms > Meta [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l‑on‑Metal Car Combat</strong> – Crash, shove, boost and side‑bash rivals</li><li><strong>13 Weapon Classes</strong> – From shotguns to railguns, all fully upgradable</li><li><strong>Over 80 Perks</strong> – Craft outrageous synergies for destruction racing supremacy</li><li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Day‑Night Cycle</strong> – Rain slicks the tarmac, fog shrouds ambushes</li><li><strong>Elite and Boss Events</strong> – Colossal war‑rigs, corrupted Enforcers, and endless zombie hordes</li><li><strong>Extensive Visual Damage Model</strong> – Windshields, hood, doors, bumpers and trunk lid will bend, crumple, hang and detach.</li></ul><p><strong>The Roguelite Campaign</strong></p><p>Every Campaign run offers a unique journey through a randomly generated graph.</p><p>Win Events and smash opponents to gain Credits.

In these safe havens you can repair your car, swap weapons, or install one of the 80+ unlockable perks.</p><p>Adapt to the dynamically increasing difficulty and conquer elite events and bosses.</p><p>With branching paths, varied objectives, and ever-changing time-of-day and weather conditions, no two runs are the same.</p><p>But the <em>Carmageddon</em> ain’t over when your vehicle is wrecked. Another driver will step up, and the challenge will resume anew, in a typical roguelite loop. Earn Beatcoins to unlock permanent bonuses and new content between runs in the Black Market. Find synergies between these elements to create the ultimate killing machine: the Carmageddon never ends.</p><p><strong>Opponents</strong></p><p>The Carmageddon hosts a diverse assembly of marauders, rejects, and lowlifes. Some prefer to rush in front of the pack. Others will chase you and try to bash you out of the way. Some will wait for the chance to unload their weapons into your car. Some are more skilled or better prepared than others. You may recognize some familiar names in the crowd.</p><p>Corrupt police forces known as the Enforcers impose their brutal rules on those spared from mutation. The Enforcers will force you off the road to strip your car for spare parts and ammo, if you let them.</p><p>Each area of the city is controlled by a particularly fierce opponent, commonly known as “the Boss”. These are the biggest, baddest, fastest, more armed vehicles that you can find. The rules of the Carmageddon demand that you beat each Boss before advancing to the next stage.</p><p>Every race is a brutal test of skill, demanding you master driving, melee, and ranged attacks against a diverse and unpredictable roster of foes. To do so, you must work on your car, find upgrades and weapons that combine well together, and consistently perform behind the wheel.</p><p><strong>The Wasted</strong></p><p>The Third World War and a series of devastating natural disasters left Earth in ruins. Amidst the chaos, a food supplement called MiVis was introduced to address food shortages, and became a ubiquitous part of daily life.</p><p>However, long-term consumption of MiVis led to a horrific cellular mutation, transforming people into Wasted – monstrous, empty husks consumed by the supplement’s side effects.</p><p>Now, they have become a mass of unsentient, super-aggressive beings that threaten survivors as soon as the sun starts to set.</p><p>A lone Wasted is no match for your chariot of fury. Things start to heat up when more Wasteds show up. Boost into the hordes of humanoid husks swarming the track, parting the waves of Wasted like a Moses on wheels! But be careful not to get stuck in the high tide: too many Wasteds will surround your car and smash it to bits with the remains of their raw hands.</p><p>And then there are Special Wasteds… horrible supermutations of the Wasted, morphed into something even less human.</p><p>They may explode, shoot you from a distance, lunge at your car, or produce even nastier surprises.</p><p>They pose a real danger and tend to show up late at night.</p><p>And then, there’s the ultimate abomination. A creature whispered about, rarely seen; the monster that guards the only mountain pass towards salvation, and your final challenge.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/carmageddon-rogue-shift-launches-in-early-2026-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/steam-deck-minus-the-screen-valve-announces-new-steam-machine-controller-hardware/">announced its upcoming Steam Machine hardware last month</a>, some eagle-eyed gamers may have been surprised to see that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">the official spec sheet</a> lists support for HDMI 2.0 output, rather than the updated, higher-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 standard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/hdmi-2-1-spec-released-ushering-in-new-era-of-dynamic-hdr-video/">introduced in 2017</a>. Now, Valve tells Ars that, while the hardware itself actually supports HDMI 2.1, the company is struggling to offer full support for that standard due to Linux drivers that are “still a work-in-progress on the software side.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hdmi-forum-to-amd-no-you-cant-make-an-open-source-hdmi-2-1-driver/">we noted last year</a>, the HDMI Forum (which manages the official specifications for HDMI standards) has officially blocked any open source implementation of HDMI 2.1. That means the open source AMD drivers used by SteamOS can’t fully implement certain features that are specific to the updated output standard.</p>
<p>“At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements,” AMD engineer Alex Deucher said at the time.</p>
<h2>Doing what they can</h2>
<p>This situation has caused significant headaches for Valve, which tells Ars it has had to validate the Steam Machine’s HDMI 2.1 hardware via Windows during testing. And when it comes to HDMI performance via SteamOS, a Valve representative tells Ars that “we’ve been working on trying to unblock things there.”</p>
<p>That includes unblocking HDMI 2.0’s resolution and frame-rate limits, which <a href="https://www.extron.com/article/hdmi2faq">max out at 60 Hz for a 4K output</a>, according to the official standard. Valve tells Ars it has been able to increase that limit to the “4K @ 120Hz” listed on the Steam Machine spec sheet, though, thanks to a technique called <a href="https://www.cablematters.com/Blog/HDMI/a-comprehensive-guide-to-chroma-subsampling?srsltid=AfmBOooodBYO5jloAUOgV_BWD8o479zIqMeMVxuI9lO9vsXT29AVrfEW">chroma sub-sampling</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>From 1997 to 2005, the Carmageddon series brought an explosive destruction derby to PCs, consoles, and handhelds through a trilogy of games and a couple of spin-offs. In 2014, Stainless Games revitalized the long-dormant franchise through Carmageddon: Reincarnation, and followed it up two years later with Carmageddon: Max Damage, but the series has been quiet ever since. Today, during the PC Gaming Show, that changed, as a new spin-off entry, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift, was announced.</p><p>As the name implies, Carmageddon: Rogue Shift adds a roguelite twist to the arcade-style vehicular combat of the series. True to that style of gameplay, you can unlock various weapons, classes, perks, and more as you battle bosses, race through the streets, and choose your path through a branching map. Each run drops you into a world with a day/night cycle with dynamic weather, where hordes of zombies emerge into the streets at night. Your only hope of escape is by winning the Carmageddon street-racing tournament. This entry promises stylish driving mechanics, tactical loadouts, and destruction-based racing.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"We are bringing something fresh to the franchise and the racing genre," game director Giuseppe Enrico Franchi said in a press release. "Carmageddon means explore, experiment, paint the streets red, and crumple up opponents. We want our players to adapt, upgrade, and unleash destruction on zombie hordes with glee behind the wheel of a killing machine."</p><p>The previous two Carmageddon console games, Reincarnation and Max Damage, did not fare well critically, with each holding a Metacritic average score in the 50s. However, Rogue Shift brings in a new developer, 34BigThings. The studio's most recent game, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/redout-2/">a racing title called Redout 2, has as high as a 78 on Metacritic</a>, with its sense of speed serving as one of the most commonly sung praises in reviews.</p><p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in early 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/carmageddon-rogue-shift-brings-back-the-vehicular-combat-cult-classic-series]]></content:encoded>

<p>Both the Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will be getting a physical in the US courtesy of PM Studios, with Reef Entertainment's European release sticking with just the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>And for those physical collectors out there, yes, the Switch 2 physical will have the full game on the cartridge. That's a nice little announcement, given that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition-out-now-includes-paid-upgrade-for-switch-owners">Switch 2 upgrade <em>just</em> came out last week</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sxywni&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you're on the fence about grabbing the game on the newer console <em>and</em> are reluctant to dive into a digital release, then you only have to wait until Spring to get your hands on a fully boxed version.</p>
<p>That cover art is nice, too!</p>

<p>Just in case you've never heard of the game before, Shuten Order is from <strong>Danganronpa</strong> creator Kazutaka Kodaka (who is one of the key writers). The game is a blend of multiple genres but it's ultimately a mystery game where you play as a character who has been murdered, and you must find your killer.</p>
<p>While we praised the ambition of the game on Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shuten-order">we ultimately felt</a> that it felt a little long in the tooth and not quite up to par with Kodaka's previous works. It looks nice, though, and the Switch 2 version allows you to reach between 60-120fps docked and handheld and use Mouse Mode.</p>

<p>Are you a Shuten Order fan? Will you be grabbing the physical release next spring? Let us know in the comments<em>.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-screenshots-photo-mode-hud-binoculars-2000650620</link>
            <guid>1373452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As a third-person shooter with just a single gun in its arsenal that lets you scope in, one almost never sees much of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gorgeous environments and explosive gameplay through first-person view.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>But there’s a way to get a look at post-apocalyptic Italy through the eyes of a Raider: Binoculars. They come with a heavy vignette and some HUD elements to make it feel like you’re using a zoomed scope, but on PC, if you hit F10, not only do you hide the HUD, but the vignetting on the binoculars goes away, leaving you with a suitably grainy image that’s perfect for taking some pretty shots of the game.</p>

 <p>That’s exactly what one IRL photographer, who shares his process on YouTube as Topside Flicks, has done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">leaving behind weapons</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p562bp/you_guys_liked_the_last_binocular_photos_i_posted/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">brave the wilds of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ violent environments</a> to catch some of the most gorgeous screenshots of the extraction shooter yet. Check out some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/BKyBjT-y-pE">gameplay here</a>:</p>

  <p>The grainy-ness of these shots is quite fitting for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ kitbashed world where Raiders have to make due with what objects they can find to get the job done. I could imagine a photographer in this world hacking together found objects to be able to snap some stills. It really looks the part. Have a gander:</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650627"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650625"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-photo-mode-bethesda-screenshot-save-location-1850835812">something of an amateur photographer myself</a>, having studied the craft briefly in college; I also grew up with a family member who made a living picking up the camera. I love a good shot, IRL or otherwise, so I had to learn more about the experience of capturing the beautiful vistas of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ world and freezing in place the sudden and intense bursts of violence the game is known for.</p>

    <p>Topside Flicks, who’s real name is Levi, and I chatted a bit over email. He said that the beauty of the game itself simply demanded he find a way to take shots “I was playing with a friend and I couldn’t stop marvelling at how great this game looked,” he told me. “I’m a photographer by trade so I’m always seeing photo opportunities.”</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650631"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650632"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> clearly makes for wonderful capture opportunities. Much of this, I suspect, has to do with the lack of color-grading and filters the game uses, as <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">Embark Studios talked about in episode two</a> of their behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p>

 <p>Aside from the practice range, every map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is an active digital warzone. I asked Levi how dangerous the photo trips are. “I die plenty of times,” he said, “but the beauty of these runs is that I’m not doing any looting, so if I die, all I lose are binoculars and some defibrillators.”</p> <div id="gallery-3"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650633"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650634"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>But as you can see from his videos, Levi isn’t afraid to get up close to some intense firefights to grab a perfect shot. Naturally, he’s had many close calls. “I get set on fire quite a lot in my videos,” he said, “the Fireballs are my arch-nemesis when I don’t have a weapon,” he added, referring to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-north-line-patch-refiner-fireball-2000644048">the rolling Arc balls</a> that love to cook players with their flamethrowing ability.</p>

 <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extract-rat-elevator-revive-defib-2000646958">Wild <i>Arc Raiders</i> Moments Like These Show Why People Love It</a></p> <p>Once on the field, binoculars in hand, he doesn’t have much of an urge to participate in the gunfire. “My mindset is strictly focused on the light and composition of whatever I’m looking at,” he said.</p> <p>It shows. While some images clearly have some post-processing edits, as any good piece of photography does, these are some strong captures, and impressive considering he’s jumping headfirst into violent warzones purely for the sake of the craft, not the loot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far this Star Wars-flavored expansion is a bit cringey, but works surprisingly well.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destiny has always been the “we’ve got Star Wars at home” looter shooter, and with Destiny 2: Renegades, Bungie has decided to lean into that directly with a crossover expansion. Weirdly enough, so far that decision seems to have kinda worked out alright! Renegades doesn’t solve many of Destiny 2’s longstanding issues, including the fact that it’s been awkwardly spinning its wheels for over a year now (reminiscent of the MCU post-Endgame), but embracing the cheesiness and over-the-top drama of Star Wars is at the very least a surprisingly nice change of pace in what has become quite a predictable universe. The story is silly, to be sure, but introduces a few new mechanics and weapon types that are a welcome change, and there’s an impressive level of enemy density throughout practically all of the activities that keeps the action interesting. I’ve still got a lot more questing and looting to do before my final review, but so far this expansion has been a pretty compelling breath of fresh air in a game I’ve otherwise been far less excited about than usual.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read any of my previous expansion reviews (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/09/destiny-2-shadowkeep-review"><u>of</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-beyond-light-review"><u>which</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review"><u>there</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-review"><u>are</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>a</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review"><u>lot</u></a>), then you’ll already know I am one those weirdo Destiny fans who has stuck with this game through thick and thin – so it should mean something when I tell you that saying I am also a Star Wars fan would be such a massive understatement that I’m actually too embarrassed to elaborate further publicly. But even with my undying love of space wizards, I was initially mortified to learn Destiny 2 was planning a crossover with it. For me, it was the ultimate sign that Destiny was out of ideas, had gone “full Fortnite” in a way that seemed cheap and tacky, and was making one last desperation play during the slow death it’s been suffering for a number of years now. And, yeah, that all pretty much turned out to be true. But when I found myself watching two lightsaber-wielding foes square off in an epic cutscene while listening to the John Williams-esque music this expansion makes heavy use of, I’ll admit it won me over… at least a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Renegades does go out of its way to include every little Star Wars reference to a degree that can feel a bit forced – a crutch that’s continuously leaned upon in lieu of any original ideas. For example, you find yourself trapped in a garbage compactor during the very first mission, rescue someone from off-brand carbon freezing, and make a jump to lightspeed while a brooding, masked villain angrily watches you escape his grasp. It’s extremely on the nose stuff, and I was just as likely to experience a full-body cringe as I was to smile about it. But the complete “screw it” energy at play here as it full-throatedly embraces all the corniness and drama for which Star Wars is known does have a certain kind of refreshing charm that’s at least a distinct direction for Destiny 2. I’ve been complaining about this game feeling stale for at least five years now, so I’ve got to give Bungie a bit of credit for trying something new here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a fair number of new mechanics that I wasn’t expecting, like a shielding system for certain enemies that forces you to deal a whole bunch of damage in a short span of time before you can actually hurt them, AT-ST-inspired walkers that have some unique attacks I wasn’t expecting, and even some new weapon types, like battery-powered guns that can be fired until they overheat and need to cool down. None of this is massively game-changing stuff, but they’re decent little tweaks to the sandbox that are welcome additions. Of course, there’s also a ton of stuff that hasn’t changed at all, and even while you’re facing off against a new kind of enemy in theory, you’ll still be fighting the same Cabal armored warriors and bony Thrall monstrosities you’ve been shooting for over a decade, which has made this feel like a cheap reskin at times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still fairly early into my space opera journey (I haven’t even crafted my lightsaber yet!), so I have a whole lot more to play before I can definitively say where Renegades lands. But so far this expansion seems much better than I expected… though that’s partially because I expected very little. I’ll have much more to say once I’ve completed the campaign and begin to dive into the endgame activities. For Light and Life!</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Destiny Rankings</h3><p>TieGuyTravis ranks each Destiny expansion since the series's conception.</p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers of a certain age, Warhammer Quest is a name to conjure with. The original 1995 release was the premier <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawler</a> of its day, a rare cooperative title in an age of head-to-head conflict games. Once it was out of print it became, and remains, highly collectable. But in 2016, publisher Games Workshop resurrected the brand with the well-received Silver Tower. Darkwater is the latest iteration, with a few new tweaks and a lot of new toys on board to try and uphold its considerable legacy.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5c848b5c-737b-48d3-b764-893eede8d035" id="233318"><div id="233318" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Warhammer Quest: Darkwater</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop is rightly known as the premier producer of plastic miniatures and, even by its own exalted standards, the range of figures included in this set are a little bit special. Six of them are heroes, the remainder are their enemies, servants of the noxious, squelchy plague god of the Warhammer universe, Nurgle. The Nurgle range has always been a terrible beauty, crammed with unpleasant details of open sores and drooling maws and there’s plenty of that on display here. But what makes these stand out is a sense of character, something that’s often missing in modern, dynamically posed figures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These pop out of your tabletop with an air of individuality, particularly the heroes who display a fine mix of old-school adventurer alongside the current sensibilities of GW’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-dominion-review">Age of Sigmar</a> setting. Facial expressions and poses seem to tell you something about each of them, from the dour scowl of mercenary Bren Tylis to the gloating grin of the central villain, Gelgus Pust. And it’s worth noting for less experienced modellers that the box’s claim of push-fit is largely true. Most of the figures are fairly easy to assemble, although a couple will benefit from a drop of polystyrene cement. Painting them is another matter, however, as the level of detail may be a bit daunting for novices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the miniatures, GW boxed games often skimp on the remainder of the components. That’s not the case here: this is a lavish production at every level, and you can see where the considerable asking price has been spent. Once you’ve lifted the figure sprues out of the box, the cards and punch-out tokens have their own carefully packed sub-box, with the cards for each of the game’s campaign acts presented in their own sealed envelopes. Although the cards could use more, and more varied, artwork, they’re sturdy, shiny and clear to read.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is a lavish production at every level."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surprising of all is the book of maps that are used in the skirmish scenarios that make up most of the game. While this is hardly a new idea, most examples are clunky and spiral-bound. This one is hard-bound, yet it still lies flat, making it an absolute pleasure to use. And the maps within are full of the kind of detailed art that we should also have seen on the cards, effectively evoking the plague-corrupted environments of the game’s setting, the Jade Abbey. More detail on the setting and narrative are provided in the game’s rulebook, offering up a great foretaste of the adventures to come.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-195821015-mp-1764789085874.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer Quest: Darkwater is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, but you’ll play with four heroes in every game, so it’s best with two or four players: solo is possible, but you’ll end up juggling a lot as the campaign progresses. It has two game modes, a one-off skirmish fight or a longer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. The focus is definitely on the latter mode, as single fights can be unbalanced depending on the scenario you end up playing, and you don’t get the fun of slowly building up your characters and revealing your own narrative of attempting to free the Jade Abbey from Nurgle’s putrefaction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A campaign consists of three acts, each of which sees you dealing out 14 random encounter cards from that act’s deck, with a boss card beneath. You then get a choice of two possible encounter cards for each adventure, and this is an important decision. Many of the encounters aren’t skirmish fights but little narrative snippets or mini-games. Most of these are of the push your luck or risk versus reward variety, but there are a couple of the more imaginative designs that made Silver Tower’s scenarios such a pleasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-200931912-1764789104928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to battle scenarios, it’s important to read the cards carefully and consider how the fight might play out. They offer a variety of maps, of enemies to fight, sidequests, victory conditions and special rules. These cause them to vary wildly in difficulty, and some can be almost impossible if you haven’t found certain rewards for your party. This is a big deal because the price for failure is high: you lose some rewards and get to try again, with a second fail ending the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duking it out on the map is based on a set of rules from another game in the series, Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAron?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>). Each hero has three action cards: move, attack, and aid. Using one requires you to expend energy, which is most commonly obtained by exhausting one of said cards, either for the action you’re taking or one of the others. Essentially this boils down to heroes taking three actions each turn, which can be any combination of the available options, although some of the rewards you can get later in the campaign complicate the picture a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat involves you rolling dice, almost always a pair, hoping to achieve a target number depending on what you’re fighting. Many enemies have a defense value that cancels out an equal number of hits, meaning you’ll have to hit on both dice to hurt them. Between the probabilities involved and the flexibility of the action system, this provides a satisfying balance of decision-making and randomness. This is not a deep game by any means, but you’ll often be torn as to how to best distribute your actions, while the turn limit on completing each battle can lead to some thrilling, high-stakes rolls towards the close.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-202234130-mp-1764789122637.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between each hero’s turn, the monsters get to activate. How they behave depends on a dice roll, and most enemies switch between a sedate black die and a more threatening red die with each passing battle round. Mostly they’ll move toward a target at variable speed and try to attack, although all the monsters also have a special effect: horrible little pox-wretches spawn new companions, while the tough daemonic cankerborn blast all nearby heroes with an area effect attack. This roll can have a major impact on the difficulty of a scenario, as monsters sometimes do nothing and sometimes unleash a terrifying onslaught, a quirk that the rules put down to their chaotic nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One flaw in this system and the map design is that most of the boards have one or more choke points caused by impassable hexes, and most of the scenarios require players to get somewhere and do something in order to win. The result is that both players and monsters get funneled toward the tight corners and scenarios can bog down in repeated roll-offs until you either clear the enemies or the time runs out. Some character abilities and items can bypass this – the dwarf ranger Drolf Ironhead can move through the odd impassable hex – but while this gives some scenarios the feel of a spatial puzzle, in others having one or two characters get a shortcut doesn’t make much difference to achieving the goal. This issue also causes a sense of repetition, despite the fairly varied scenario design.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251124-194023242-1764789139244.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Victory, and the completion of sidequest goals, results in reward cards being doled out to the adventurers. Like the scenarios themselves these vary in power, with better items being available later in the campaign, but the more impressive items are often one-shot, while more minor power-ups can be re-used. They all add more tactical options to battles, which is absolutely a good thing. Weighing up whether or not to throw your magical one-off widget into the mix in an attempt to save a scenario that’s going south is always a knife-edge decision and adds extra frisson to the dice-rolls that usually result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even on-board battle scenarios only last about 30 minutes so, when you mix in the much shorter mini-game encounters, playing through an act doesn’t take all that long. “Saving” the game state between sessions is a minor pain but perfectly possible. All the adventure cards have their own text preamble to set the scene and, as you progress through the campaign, there are secrets to uncover and some new playable characters to unlock. The unfolding narrative isn’t going to win any literary awards but it’s effective at giving your playthrough a solid storybook backbone. Nurgle is a particularly fun opponent to tackle, his servitors by turns fatherly and feculent, so freeing the once-pristine Jade Abbey from their clutches feels like a worthy goal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251128-113953298-1764789159676.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgmxY?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Warhammer</a>  </li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 4, 2025 6:13 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Compared to the long grind that characterized the last Warhammer Quest game, Cursed City, Warhammer Quest: Darkwater feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s faster, lighter and more approachable, and is very much a coherent miniatures game rather than a box of cool figures with some rules thrown in as an afterthought. Despite the cracking production quality, this won’t win over any GW naysayers: play is still very random and the difficulty is uneven. But the unfolding tale is compelling nevertheless, with enough decision making to engage your neurons and plenty of exciting moments. Fundamentally, whether you’re willing to pay the considerable asking price on this package likely boils down to how much you want the amazing miniatures. But if you do invest, you’ll find that it can capably stand toe-to-toe with a lot of modern dungeon crawl designs.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-quest-darkwater-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love PvE co-op games but murderous robots are giving you low level PTSD, Cast Outs is here to stir up the genre with a modern take on fantasy. Designed from the ground up for co-op, it takes the usual Dungeons &amp; Dragons tropes of goblins, elves and magic spells, and turns them into a 2-4 player playground to battle in. It's got pedigree too, because while it's the first game from UK studio Twisted Works, that studio is home to veterans who have worked on games like Horizon Forbidden Resident Evil 7, Killzone, and the Total War series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations as one of those games where you had to just realize that you're not going to do this alone," explains James Brace, Twisted Works CEO and the Cast Outs Creative Director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is no single player mode. As a studio, when we approached this game we wanted a very sharp, narrow focus on this genre of co-op combat. As a team, you get to experience a whole bunch of missions and modes, different ways to play. We have runs, not unlike the Left 4 Dead kind of experience, but we also have sandbox areas, we have Horde modes. It balances everything we loved about scripted elements - those cinematic wow moments that we love in games like Left 4 Dead - with these playgrounds that allow a lot more freedom of exploration, and a lot more emergent gameplay."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fantasy Co-op Cast Outs First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of a team of three refugees from a doomed realm in another dimension, the aim for you and two battle buddies is to fight through a fantastical version of modern day London with a mix of team combos, magical powers and parkour style agility. Talking to the teams there's clearly a lot of thought that's gone into the story - with references to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Percy Jackson referenced as team favorites, but the focus is also one letting players create their own weird and wonderful Tiktok share worthy moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're going to have a lot of visual storytelling, what I call passive storytelling. It's there in the world. You can see it. You can absorb at your pace. It can come through the characters. We can have a lot of lore come through the characters like we've seen in a lot of roster based games, but in terms of your adventure, your run, that's your story. The first kind of thing we wanted to try and do is make sure there's enough dynamics in the experience to create unique stories," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, Cast Outs is built with short sessions in mind, but adds a progression system to keep you coming back for more. As well as learning your particular preferred combination of magic and run-based, Roguelike lite upgrade systems, there will be cosmetics to show off your Cast Outs skills and tenure, and a charm system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While playing, you're collecting ingredients. Those ingredients can be crafted into charms - it's where some of the magic still exists in London from the people who came over - and you can wear these charms and take them into battle," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You're going to have charm slots so you're going to have dilemmas about how many charms you're going to take in. I'll be going, 'Oh what are you carrying in? I'm taking this.' And it's ultimately driving the progression system to get all the charms and to have the most flexibility on play styles. You'll be able to support your team with charms. A lot of our charms aren't individual. They're helping the team more like perks and buffs for the group. I think people are going to like them because it enables you to um, take the classes and turn your tank into a bit more like a support tank or a bit more DPS."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Planned for release on PC, PS5 and Xbox with crossplay, there's no release date yet, but the Twisted Works team is big on playtesting and building its community to help shape the game. Check out the studio's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tBNw5AnRt7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a> to find out more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're still shocked that through our play testing that players are telling us about and showing us new ways to play with our own magic that we never thought of, which is absolutely fantastic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar.
