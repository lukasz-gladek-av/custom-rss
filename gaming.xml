<p>The patch notes (via <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-1-2-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>) aren't particularly detailed, but they cover both the base Switch version of the game <em>and</em> for those playing on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here's the rundown of all the updates now available for Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 on Switch:</p>
<h3>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Version 1.2.0 Patch Notes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several fixes and adjustments made to improve the gameplay experience on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
- Several issues fixed to ensure smooth gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890wmruvx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So... pretty vague, as usual! Perhaps just the usual smoothing out minor issues. The duo are already playable at 4k resolution docked and 1080p handheld, so we'll take any minor updates.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want the verdict on whether now is the time to pick up these classic Wii games — or if you <em>just</em> want to grab one of them — then check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-galaxy-plus-super-mario-galaxy-2">our 9/10 review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-re-launching-amazon-luna-later-this-year-introduces-new-party-games-focused-gamenight-feature.1313785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon is re-launching its Amazon Luna service later this year with a new design and new features, including a rotating library of games available to Amazon Prime subscribers, playable through Luna's cloud services.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna#ags-MediaPopup">long blog post on the Amazon Games site</a>, Amazon announces the overhaul coming to Amazon Luna while touting its belief that "<em>gaming needs a rethink</em>." It frames the fact that there are more users playing games on mobile devices than there are on PCs or consoles as the videogame industry's failure to "<em>welcome the 100s of millions of people who want to experience the magic of playing games on the big screen but feel left out - those who don't see themselves as 'gamers,' those who don't want to spend a fortune on hardware, or those who just want something simple, social, and fun</em>."</p>



<p>Without exploring the possibility that the 100s of millions of people who play games on their phones might possibly prefer to play the select few games they enjoy that way, the blog post continues to introduce "<em>a completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna that combines innovative social party games with amazing blockbusters to make every night in your house the perfect game night to share with your family and friends</em>."</p>



<p>A new trailer shared along with the post shows the new Luna in action, which will be an added feature for Amazon Prime subscribers "<em>at no additional cost</em>" to the current subscription price they already pay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing: The All-New Amazon Luna" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajawdjs6KKA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two key features coming in this redesign include GameNight, a library of Amazon Luna-exclusive titles mostly comprised of party and social games that can be played through your phone, just like the widely popular JackBox Party titles. Its featured launch title is 'Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg', which is "<em>a human-built, AI-powered improv courtroom game where players</em> <em>invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg</em>."</p>



<p>There will be a total of 25 titles launching for GameNight whenever the new Luna arrives, with new variations of Angry Birds, Exploding Kittens, Flappy Golf Party, Taboo, Clue, and Ticket to Ride, to name a few.</p>



<p>The other key feature coming to this new version of Amazon Luna is a new rotating library of games, including Hogwarts Legacy, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Dave the Diver, Dead Island 2, Borderlands 3, and more, all playable through the cloud. There's a base library of games available through your regular Amazon Prime subscription, but there's also a premium tier to the new Amazon Luna that'll get you other big titles, including "<em>EA Sports FC 25, LEGO DC Super Villains, Team Sonic Racing, and Batman: Arkham Knight</em>."</p>



<p>These titles will all be playable through any Bluetooth-compatible controller, or, of course, an Amazon Luna controller will work.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-review-hardware-service-and-performance/">When Wccftech reviewed Amazon Luna two years ago</a>, we concluded that it was the content, not the hardware and cloud experience, that held it back. This redesign seems to try to address exactly that. But it's more than lofty for Amazon to try suggesting that "<em>gaming needs a rethink,</em>" as if those who already enjoy games in their own way, whether that's through consoles, PCs, or mobile devices, are currently doing it wrong.</p>



<p>We'll see what this overhaul does for Amazon Luna when it arrives sometime later in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month.1313779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is raising the price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription again and rebranding some of its Xbox Game Pass plans. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans">Starting today</a>, Game Pass Ultimate will be priced at $29.99 per month instead of $19.99 — a 50 percent increase. Microsoft is attempting to justify the price hike with a variety of upgrades across all of its Xbox Game Pass tiers.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Core is being rebranded to Xbox Game Pass Essential, and the Standard plan is now Xbox Game Pass Premium.</p><p>“What’s new for everyone across all three Xbox Game Pass plans is bigger game libraries, including PC games across each of the plans,” explains Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>. “There is also unlimited cloud gaming, which is new to Essential and Premium subscribers.”</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-ultimate"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2></p></div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is moving from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month, which is a surprising $10 increase. While Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate last year without improving the subscription, it’s adding a bunch of improvements this time around. “[Game Pass Ultimate] will now include access to more than 400 titles globally, this includes the majority of our partners who want to continue to bring their future games to Xbox Game Pass,” Blackwell explains.</p><p>Microsoft is adding 45 games to Game Pass Ultimate today alone, including <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, a variety of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> titles, and many more Ubisoft games. “We’re also now giving access to more than 75 day one releases each year,” Blackwell says. “That’s a 50 percent increase over the day one titles we provided last year.”</p><p>Ubisoft Plus Classics is also now part of Game Pass Ultimate, a perk that provides access to a selection of Ubisoft games across console, PC, and cloud. On November 18th, Fortnite Crew will also be part of Ultimate, which gives subscribers the Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-bucks each month, and more. “With Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft Plus Classics, those combined add about $28 a month in value to Ultimate subscribers,” Blackwell says.</p><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is also coming out of beta and getting 1440p resolution support and bitrate improvements for certain games on select devices. These cloud improvements are exclusive to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>Finally, Microsoft is also reworking its rewards program. Ultimate subscribers can now earn up to $100 per year (100,000 points) in the store just by playing games.</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-premium"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Premium</h2></p></div><p>Game Pass Premium will be priced at the same $14.99 monthly price of the existing Standard subscription, but it will now have a bigger library of games to choose from. More than 200 games will be available on both Xbox and PC, giving Game Pass Premium subscribers access to PC games for the first time — including <em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> today.</p><p>Game Pass Premium is also getting unlimited cloud access for the first time, meaning you no longer need a Game Pass Ultimate subscription to get access to Xbox Cloud Gaming. Premium subscribers will be able to stream titles from the Game Pass library, as well as select titles they own.</p><p>While Game Pass Premium won’t get access to day one launch titles like Game Pass Ultimate does, Microsoft is now making a clear commitment to bring new Xbox-published games to this subscription tier “within a year of their launch.” This excludes <em>Call of Duty </em>titles, but every other Microsoft-owned Xbox game will be available.</p><p>Microsoft is also expanding its in-game Game Pass perks down to the Premium subscription, instead of being locked to Ultimate. Subscribers will get in-game benefits in games like <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, and <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X</em>. Premium subscribers will also be able to earn up to $50 a year by playing games through Microsoft’s rewards program.</p><div><p id="xbox-game-pass-essential"><h2>Xbox Game Pass Essential</h2></p></div><p>Game Pass Essential will be priced at the same $9.99 monthly price of the existing Core subscription, but it will now include more than 50 titles in the library instead of the more than 25 games that were available in Core. You’ll also be able to play all of these titles on PC or console, and there’s even unlimited cloud access, which was previously only available through the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p><p>Essential subscribers will also be able to stream select games they own, as well as access in-game benefits from Riot Games and earn up to $25 a year in the store through Microsoft’s revamped rewards program.</p><div><p id="pc-game-pass-price-changes-and-more"><h2>PC Game Pass price changes and more</h2></p></div><p>Microsoft is also increasing the price of its PC Game Pass subscription today, moving from $11.99 a month to $16.49 monthly — a nearly 40 percent increase. Microsoft isn’t trying to justify this increase with any added extras for PC players, though.</p><p>“The only change happening for PC Game Pass subscribers is that they won’t be getting Ubisoft Plus Classics, but they’ll be getting about 50 additional Ubisoft titles across PC Game Pass,” Blackwell says. “It will continue to get day one titles.”</p><p>With PC games also being added to both Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium today, I get the feeling that Microsoft may eventually rethink its dedicated subscription for PC gamers and try and tempt subscribers over to its Essential, Premium, or Ultimate tiers instead.</p><p>While the Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium tiers aren’t seeing price increases in the US today, pricing will be adjusted for these plans in some markets. All existing Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers will be automatically upgraded to the Essential and Premium plans. Any price changes begin today for new subscribers, or at the next billing cycle for existing Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>The price increases come after Microsoft has been increasingly investing in Game Pass deals over the past year. “This last year alone we’ve made our largest investment in Game Pass so far, signing deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog over time,” Blackwell says.</p><p>Microsoft is also set to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">increase the price of its Xbox consoles</a> in the US again later this week, with the Xbox Series X now $150 more than it was just six months ago. Microsoft and Asus also just announced that the upcoming Xbox Ally X handheld will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder">priced at $999.99</a> in the US.</p><p>“We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we’re trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well,” Blackwell says. “It’s something we don’t take lightly, and we’re listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they’re asking for.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is finally coming out of its preview state, more than five years after the streaming service first launched in 2020. “We’re officially removing the beta tag from Xbox Cloud Gaming,” says Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The beta tag removal coincides with some key changes to Xbox Cloud Gaming today, and a big <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. Microsoft is also expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming to more Game Pass tiers, and it’s improving the streaming quality and resolution exclusively for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>“We’ll have our highest streaming quality yet for Ultimate subscribers,” Blackwell says. “It’ll go up to 1440p for select games and select devices, and still deliver the shortest wait times for players.”</p><p>Some Xbox Cloud Gaming users <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/776320/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-limitations-strategy-notepad">already spotted</a> the 1440p support in games like <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> last month, with bitrates that can peak at 27Mbps. Most Xbox Cloud Gaming streams average at around 10Mbps right now, with some devices able to access a better 17Mbps stream. An upgrade to 27Mbps should greatly reduce artifacts and improve the visual quality of game streams.</p><p>It’s the first major visual quality improvement to Xbox Cloud Gaming since Microsoft upgraded the hardware in the service to Xbox Series X-like blades. The previous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527432/microsoft-xcloud-server-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade-game-streaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming upgrade in 2021</a> allowed games to load faster and have improved frame rates, all because the hardware enabled support for Xbox Series S / X-optimized titles.</p><p>It’s not immediately clear whether Microsoft is doing any hardware upgrades to enable 1440p support and higher bitrates this time around. I asked the company to comment on whether PC-like hardware is being used in its Xbox Cloud Gaming configurations to enable these upgrades, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>The expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming to Microsoft’s new Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium tiers will allow many more Xbox fans to access cloud games they own or titles from the Game Pass library. It’s the first time, beyond the free-to-play <em>Fortnite </em>streaming, that Microsoft has enabled cloud access beyond its top Ultimate plan.</p><p>The 1440p upgrade is still limited to select games and select devices, and Microsoft needs to go further to match the impressive quality from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on">Nvidia’s GeForce Now service</a>. I suspect we’ll have to wait until Microsoft is ready with its next-gen console launch to see a bigger upgrade to 4K resolution, higher frame rates, and even better bitrates.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft are reshuffling their Xbox Game Pass subscription tiers and hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass in certain regions. You'll now need to pay $29.99 a month for Ultimate - a 50% jump, with pricing for places outside the US to follow. PC Game Pass subscriptions are going up from $11.99 to $16.49 monthly - around 40 percent higher. 
</p>

<p>
"We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we're trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well," Dustin Blackwell, director of gaming and platform communications at Microsoft, told the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">Verge</a> in a briefing. "It's something we don't take lightly, and we're listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they're asking for." 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft are attempting to sweeten the pill by means of larger game catalogues per tier, expanded access to their cloud gaming services, and various other perks detailed in full on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">the Xbox Newswire</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ultimate now includes access to various Ubisoft games via Ubisoft Plus Classics, plus the Fortnite Crew service, which spans a load of seasonal Fortnite stuff.  Ultimate subscribers will also get access to the poshest version of Microsoft's cloud gaming service, which includes 1440p resolution support and bitrate improvements on certain devices. Microsoft are also promising to increase the number of Xbox games coming to Ultimate at release day. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Xbox Game Pass Core is being rebranded to Xbox Game Pass Essential ($9.99/month, around 50 games), and the Standard plan is now Xbox Game Pass Premium ($14.99/month, around 200 games). Both tiers now include access to new cloud gaming features alongside PC games. While neither of these services will cost more than Core and Premium in the US, they'll see pricing adjustments in some regions. Again, more to follow.
</p>
<p>PC Pass subscribers benefit the least from all these changes, seemingly. "The only change happening for PC Game Pass subscribers is that they won’t be getting Ubisoft Plus Classics, but they’ll be getting about 50 additional Ubisoft titles across PC Game Pass," Blackwell told the Verge. "It will continue to get day one titles."</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">note</a>, Microsoft's Game Pass price hikes come in the wake of both record returns and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. Game Pass <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">earned them $5 billion last year</a>, while Microsoft saw an overall 18 percent increase in revenue to $76.4 billion. Microsoft have also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">bumped up the price of their console hardware</a> in the USA. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subscription-models-like-xbox-game-pass-are-not-properly-valuing-developers-says-former-bethesda-exec">debates continue</a> about whether videogame subscription services are good for participating developers.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft are also currently the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">a consumer boycott over their business partnerships with the Israeli military</a> during the latter's assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, which a UN commission of inquiry has now <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds">formally defined as a genocide</a>. The Boycott, Divest, Sanctions movement has specifically called on people to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions until Microsoft divest fully from the state. The company recently announced that they would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">block Israeli military access to Azure and AI services</a> used for a specific surveillance project that violates their terms of service, but they continue to do business with Israel's armed forces at large.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-is-trying-to-auction-off-a-cheeto-shaped-like-the-atari-logo-on-ebay.1313761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! I’m in a bad mood today. Don’t talk to me. Yeah, whatever, welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about.&nbsp; Just read this post about the <em>Witcher</em> author being upset about the games changing his lore and some other stuff, and then leave me alone. I’m going back to my room. Don’t bug me.</p> <h2><strong>How Much Would You Pay For An Atari-Shaped Cheeto?</strong></h2> <p>Over on eBay, a person is trying to auction off a Cheeto they claim to have found in a bag that kind of looks like the Atari logo. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/286850038931?mkcid=16&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&amp;ssspo=c-3F8w9eS6u&amp;sssrc=2524149&amp;ssuid=c-3F8w9eS6u&amp;stype=1&amp;widget_ver=artemis&amp;media=COPY">The seller is also offering the Cheeto for the buy-now price of $10,000</a>. “What can I say? It’s the ultimate showpiece for the ultimate Atari fan,” is how the seller describes this item on the website. They then explain “in all seriousness” that some “weird stuff” is happening in their life right now, and extra money would be a “huge blessing to me and my family.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr">The seller also claims that they have been a part of the Atari homebrew community for a while now and even published and co-designed a few games. Oh, and they were also a professional wrestler. Wild stuff. All of this might explain why they add in that, if requested, they’ll even sign the Atari-shaped Cheeto piece, too.&nbsp; “Happy bidding,” is how the seller ends the Cheeto’s listing. Nobody has placed a bid as of 9:30 a.m. EST on October 1.</p>

 <h2><strong>There Aren’t Actually Multiple Witcher Schools, Says Creator Of The Series</strong></h2> <p>You know how in the Witcher games there are multiple “Witcher Schools”? Geralt, for example, is from the School of the Wolf. And the <em>Witcher 4</em> teaser included a look at the medallion for the School of the Lynx. There are others, too, in the universe of the games. But according to the author behind the OG <em>Witcher</em> books, Andrzej Sapkowski, all of that is hogwash based on a single sentence that shouldn’t have been included at all.</p>

 <p>“A single sentence about some ‘school of the Wolf’ mysteriously made its way into <em>The Last Wish,</em>” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-says-one-of-cd-projekts-big-story-points-is-actually-based-on-a-mistake-but-videogame-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity/">Sapkowski explained in a Reddit AMA spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> “I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later, I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly videogame people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these ‘witcher schools.’ Completely unnecessary.”</p>

 <p>As for what happens now, Sapkowski says he might expand on the concept in future stories, or he might just have his publisher remove the sentence from future copies of the book. Either way, it’s safe to say the games are doing their own thing compared to the books, which is fine. Adaptations don’t need to be carbon copies of the original work to be worthwhile.</p>

 <h2><strong>We’ll Learn More About The Future Of <em>Halo</em> Later This Month</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">Last October,</a> Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) and Xbox unveiled the first look at the future of <em>Halo</em> games during the franchise’s annual esports tournament, the Halo World Cup aka Halo WC. Well, after teasing it earlier this year, Xbox has confirmed one again that they’ll have more to share about the future of <em>Halo</em>, which is likely to be built in Unreal Engine, at this year’s upcoming Halo WC.</p>

 <p>“Like last year, we’ll be on the Main Stage to talk about it, but this year we’ve also got a deep dive panel planned for the Community Stage that you won’t want to miss,” explained Halo <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc2025">eSports lead Tashi on the official <em>Halo</em> website.</a> We’ll likely get a new trailer and maybe even some early gameplay footage of the next <em>Halo</em> game. The Halo WC takes place from October 24 to October 26.</p> <h2><strong><em>Prototype</em> Might Be Getting A Remaster Or Something</strong></h2> <p>Remember <em>Prototype</em>, that open-world anti-superhero action game from Activision released back in the Xbox 360 era? Probably not, but if you do remember it and were wondering what’s up with <em>Prototype</em>, well, dataminers have dug up evidence that the game might be getting a full remaster or at least a cleaned-up re-release of sorts over 15 years after launch.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prototype-remaster-may-be-on-the-way-after-new-credits-were-quietly-added-to-the-steam-version">As reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, the game has received numerous behind-the-scenes updates on Steam, and it looks like Iron Galaxy, a studio known for remastering games, is now included in the game’s credits. Interesting stuff…for people who miss <em>Prototype</em>.</p> <h2><strong>ICYMI:&nbsp;</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340">Capcom wants to lock <em>SF6</em> finals behind a paywall</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268"><em>Black Ops 7</em> wants cheaters to come cheat in the beta</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-skin-contest-china-junkrat-furry-diaper-2000630263"><em>Overwatch 2</em> fans want a Junkrat skin that puts him in a diaper</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>Microsoft is adding a bunch of games to Xbox Game Pass to make Wednesday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price hike announcement sting a little less</a>.<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em> is the big one being added to all tiers of the program. Of the more than 80 games joining across different tiers, many are Ubisoft Classics, including <em>Assassins Creed: Black Flag</em> and<em> Far Cry 3</em>. A ton are also PC-only games, so if you&nbsp;<em>only</em> own an Xbox Series X/S, I’m not sure what exactly you’re supposed to do with those. Some of them will run on anything, like the original <em>Fallout</em>. Others, like the hit medieval settlement sim <em>Manor Lords</em>, will not.</p> <p>Here’s the complete list of every game added to Game Pass on October 1, 2025:</p> <h3><strong>Ultimate – Available

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another way to get new Call of Duty games with Game Pass is to subscribe to PC Game Pass, although, as with Ultimate, it's going to cost you more than before. The subscription service is rising in price from $12/month to $16.50/month. That's an increase of 37.5%, which is not as significant as the 50% price increase for Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>Subscribers to Xbox Game Pass Essential and Premium--the tiers formerly known as Core and Standard--will not get to play new Call of Duty games at launch. This was the case previously and it's staying true going forward. In the fine print, Microsoft said Premium subscribers will get new Xbox-published games "within a year of their launch," with the exception of Call of Duty titles.</p><p>That's a significant asterisk, given that Call of Duty is one of Microsoft's marquee brands. What this seems to mean is that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won't come to Game Pass Premium for some time.</p><p>The Game Pass name changes and price hikes are now in effect, but Amazon continues to sell one-month Game Pass Ultimate subscription for $20.</p><p>For more on Game Pass, be sure to check out our gallery below where we run through the best Game Pass titles available.</p>

            <p>BioWare veteran Mark Darrah has discussed the $55bn private acquisition of EA and what the future holds for the RPG studio, suggesting it could be sold to pay off debt.</p>
<p>The buyout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">announced earlier this week</a>, is by a group of investors comprising Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and investment firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners. Of the $55bn, $36bn is in equity with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">remaining $20bn in JPMorgan debt</a>, which EA will need to cover.</p>
<p>In his latest YouTube video, Darrah (best known as a producer across the Dragon Age games) suggested EA may be looking to sell off some of its biggest IPs and studios in order to service that debt.</p>

<p>Darrah explained EA is incentivised not to take risks, and selling off an IP only for it to become a huge success elsewhere would be a notable risk. Doing nothing "keeps them from getting into trouble", but now that incentive could be completely flipped to drive immediate revenue.</p>
<p>"EA has a huge repository of dormant IPs that are just sitting there dormant," said Darrah. "It seems unlikely that the new resulting structure is going to be eager to suddenly revive a bunch of those IPs.</p>
<p>"So one option might be to sell the whole lot of them for a hundred million dollars if you can get it, because a hundred million dollars can come off the debt. You might even see them toying with the idea of shedding some of their existing studios. Maybe they shut them down, but maybe they look for opportunities to sell off entire studios, or entire groups."</p><p>He continued: "It makes a tonne of sense for this new group to want EA Sports whole and strong and to continue doing what it's doing. EA Entertainment…may make a lot less sense. So you could imagine potentially all of EA Entertainment being sold off to another group with deep pockets."</p>

<p>He even suggested that, as this deal has likely been in the works for a while, it's conceivable EA's new structure was intentionally planned to make it easier to sell off parts of the business. As such, EA owns plenty of studios that haven't shipped a game in a while, or have experienced problems, or make "the kind of games that this new company isn't interested in making anymore".</p>
<p>Darrah noted EA has "a lot of momentum" in not selling studios, but added "we're in a new world now". "It's incredibly unlikely that EA stays exactly as it currently is in a private structure, especially carrying £20bn worth of debt," he said.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean for BioWare specifically?</p>
<p>"For the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn't line up with your own political views…you're going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure," said Darrah.</p><p>"It's hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse because it's what the government wants. It's hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn't apocalyptically bad." That would mean leaving the studio alone, or assuming it no longer fits in the organisation.</p>
<p>While Darrah is, of course, merely speculating, the deal certainly brings the future of all EA's studios into question. Yet with the progressive nature of its RPGs, BioWare's future under a Saudi-owned company is particularly uncertain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ceo-of-ea-says-values-remain-unchanged-following-sale-saudi-investment-firms">In a statement to employees</a>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said the company's "values and our commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>development team has announced that the rhythm game will be delisted in just a few days, so if you haven't played it yet and you want to, make sure you pick it up sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In a message on the game's Discord server (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rock-band-4-delists-october-5th-pre-2015-dlcs-as-well.1313488/#post-145880428" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Yoshi</a>), the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>say that because the "core licenses" for the game's music are expiring,&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>will be removed from both the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts.</p>

<p>As is often the case with digital delisting, if you've already bought the game, then you can continue to download and play it at your leisure, and naturally, that goes for if you've got a boxed copy of&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rock-band-4-delisting-superunknown.jpg?itok=Wyw_kPmg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rock-band-4-delisting-superunknown.jpg?itok=8TlZfYKO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>is about to be delisted, so grab it while you can!</figcaption></figure><p>You might be wondering what's going to happen to&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4</em>'s plethora of DLC songs, and sadly, the same applies to them: as soon as they hit their ten-year milestone, they'll be taken down, but until then, you'll still be able to pick them up.</p>

<p><em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>was originally released back in 2015, and at time of writing, it's still the most recent mainline entry in the series. Like previous&nbsp;<em>Rock Band&nbsp;</em>titles, the game sees players teaming up on instrument peripherals to take on a variety of songs across different genres (despite the name).</p>

<p>It's also the last game in the series (assuming it continues in any form, that is) to be developed by original creator Harmonix, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rock-band-developer-harmonix-acquired-by-epic-games-will-make-fortnite-content" rel="nofollow">purchased by Epic Games back in 2021</a>&nbsp;and which is now responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">very&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-tiers-rejigged-yet-again-ultimate-now-costs-30-a-month.1313695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced another shakeup to the way Xbox Game Pass tiers work, and you're now going to be forking over a lot more cash if you want an Ultimate subscription.</p>

<p>As detailed in an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, there will now be three core tiers of Game Pass: Essential, Premium, and Ultimate (and yes, that wording will probably seem rather familiar if you're a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-spartacus-revealed-as-playstation-plus-overhaul" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Plus devotee</a>).</p>

<p>The PC Game Pass tier is disappearing; all three tiers will now go across PC and console. The Essential tier is, as you'd imagine, the cheapest on offer, and it grants access to "50+ games", unlimited cloud gaming, and console multiplayer for $10 per month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-changes-2025-new-tiers.jpg?itok=3vTgJtch 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-changes-2025-new-tiers.jpg?itok=HcvZe2Uh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is overhauling its Game Pass subscription service.</figcaption></figure><p>The second tier is Premium, which will cost you $14.99 per month and grant you access to Xbox-published games "within a year of launch", although that appears to exclude games in the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>You'll also get the same benefits as the Essential tier, although you'll enjoy "shorter wait times" for cloud gaming. Naturally, the benefits for the Premium and Essential tiers are also rolled into Ultimate, which is the only tier whose name hasn't changed.</p>

<p>What has changed is the pricing; you'll now be coughing up an eye-watering $30 per month for Game Pass Ultimate, and in return, you'll get "75+ day one games a year, including all Xbox-published games day one". As a reminder, Ultimate subscribers already get this benefit for $20 a month.</p>

<p>Other Ultimate benefits include access to the Ubisoft+ Classics range and a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew subscription, as well as "best quality" cloud gaming with "shortest wait times".</p>




<p>These changes, which come into effect immediately, are the second major Game Pass overhaul in under two years, although this one's arguably more drastic than the one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">put into effect back in July last year</a>.</p>

<p>The changes also come shortly after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">declared</a> that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Game Pass service, although that hasn't stopped former Xbox staffers and other industry luminaries from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">questioning the service's worth</a> to creators.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has gotten its first hotfix since releasing in 1.0 form late last month, with Supergiant taking care of a bunch of issues. Some are related to the narrative threads you'll need to pull en-route to the true ending to Melinoë's task. One stops a pesky bug that'd have driven me straight to the verge of quitting for good cropping up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Without any further ado, let's proceed into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/505089031138181922?l=english">Steam post chamber</a> and see if reading the notes nets any nectar. "Several narrative scripting issues with specific events involving Hecate" have been rectified, Supergiant wrote. They've also solved a problem which led her not to speak about REDACTED in a certain situation.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to trust me on this in order for this newsing not to wander into spoiler territory, REDACTED is very important to the final bit of Hades 2's plot, so while this issue with Hecate doesn't look to be uber-critical, I'm glad to see Supergiant are making sure there are no issues with the narrative gears around it. Especially given how fragmented the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>'s story beats can be since they're wrapped around and amongst different runs.</p>
<p>The other fix that's caught my eye is one that stops Mel being automatically returned to shadow - that's the death that ends a run - right at the moment she defeats the fearsome final boss of the Olympus path. As I found out while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">reviewing the 1.0 version of the game</a>, said boss is arguably a tougher challenge than old time bloke Chronos himself, so you best believe if I managed to get all that way just to be denied a chance to bask in the glory of Zeus and co's crib, I wouldn't be best pleased. It never happened to me, luckily, but even imagining it's enough to make the hairs on my neck stand up.</p><p>Beyond those, there's an important-sounding fix for "key incantations" not being completeable "due to modified data" and one for a bit of cool dialogue which sees the giant Polyphemus react uniquely to a certain keepsake being equipped not firing properly.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the fixes, they non-spoilery ones are as follows, with the few I've left out being findable in the Steam post linked earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed most Olympian Keepsake effects not activating again after their Boon is skipped</li>
<li>Fixed Phantom (Fields) being able to drain Life from your raised servants</li>
<li>Fixed Fated List Prophecies related to Hidden Aspects not clearing in specific circumstances</li>
<li>Fixed the Achievement Soothing Soak not unlocking from events with Moros</li>
<li>Fixed the Achievement So Mote It Be unlocking sooner than expected</li>
<li>Fixed Gorgon Amulet (Athena) using up the effect of Yarn of Ariadne (Charon) when it shouldn't</li>
<li>Fixed an interaction between Uncommon Upbringing (Hera) and Concave Stone (Echo)</li>
<li>Fixed key visual effects sometimes not playing on some systems</li>
<li>Fixed Canines spawned from Lycaons unexpectedly activating Unseen Ire (Hades)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you could not exit the final Location in Erebus in a certain case</li>
<li>Fixed cases where taking Armor damage with Trusty Shield (Hephaestus) could damage your semi-permanent Armor instead</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue that involved claiming Gemstones then immediately using one of Homer's Inspect Points</li>
<li>Fixed Hecuba running back and forth in the chamber with Narcissus</li>
<li>Fixed several rare crashes</li>
<li>Updates to translations in some languages</li>
<li>Improved compatibility with Chinese Input Method</li>
<li>Other minor fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, be on your Melinoë.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair’s Palworld has stirred up much debate among game developers and players alike. However, former Capcom game developer Yoshiki Okamoto’s recent YouTube video, in which he made comments seemingly against Pocketpair and Palworld, has sparked a strong backlash from viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Current chairman of the Japan Game Culture Foundation, Yoshiki Okamoto has worked in the game industry for over 40 years, with a varied resume which includes Street Fighter 2, the first Resident Evil, and hit mobile game Monster Strike. He also created the original concept for what would become Rockstar’s Red Dead Revolver.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIhdKKNRnI0?si=rTqnRy6Ngo_oolxe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> posted on his channel on September 27, Okamoto gave his opinions on the ongoing Nintendo vs. Pocketpair lawsuit, saying that Palworld had "crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the video, Okamoto said that “if a settlement is reached with Nintendo, then I think it (Palworld) will become a game that is officially fine to play. However, it is currently a game that’s being sued so it’s unacceptable. By playing the game you are supporting it, so please don’t buy it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comment and his labelling of Pocketpair as an “anti-xxxx” (Okamoto bleeped out and distorted the last kanji character of the word in both the audio and subtitle in the video) prompted a flood of criticism in the comments — and many did not hold back. The majority of commenters interpreted Okamoto’s half-obscured term as “hansha” or “anti-social force” (an abbreviated term often used to describe criminal organizations like the yakuza, and groups that operate in ways that go against the proper and/or legal way of doing things). One commenter pointed out that calling Pocketpair an “anti-social force” could be considered defamation. They then added, “On the other hand, your argument that ‘people should stop playing games with questionable content because this equates to supporting them’ is convincing,” before announcing that these words made them decide to quit playing Okamoto’s Monster Strike after nearly 20 years. Other user reactions included, “I think assuming something is bad just because it has been sued is wrong,” and, “No matter how much you dislike (Pocketpair and Palworld), calling them anti-social is crossing a line.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/screenshot-2025-10-01-135403-1759323276728.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshiki Okamoto issued controversial comments on Palworld. Image credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIhdKKNRnI0?si=23R4LY-SlCDpqTaa">Yoshiki Okamoto YouTube channel.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto openly acknowledges that even though people have recommended it to him, he has never actually played Palworld, insisting: “I have no intention of playing the game or spending money on it.” He pointed out that Palworld had become a divisive topic, with people split into fan and hater camps, and confirmed that he is anti-Palworld. “But at the same time, I understand that there are fans out there,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, Okamoto also expressed concern that if Pocketpair wins the lawsuit and is able to release the full version of the game, then copyright infringement may be seen as more acceptable if a game is perceived as interesting and gets good reviews. He also worried that this could potentially open the floodgates to the hard work of creators on other Nintendo series (like Mario, Zelda etc.) being more freely and overtly copied, especially with the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, commenters also pointed out that many games have used elements of previous titles made by other companies, noting that this includes games Okamoto worked on. People mentioned how Street Fighter 2 used similar elements to previous fighting games like Yie Ar Kung Fu, and how Monster Strike’s UI is similar to Puzzle &amp; Dragons. “How can someone who has done things like that speak out against Palworld?” sad one commented. Others pointed out that Okamoto’s mention of generative AI risks feeding the false rumor (since debunked by Pocketpair) that developer used gen AI in the creation of Palworld.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Referencing the changes made to Palworld mechanics under dispute in the lawsuit, Okamoto predicted that Pocketpair have worked out some way to settle the matter with Nintendo, which is why it has announced a full, official release of the game. However, he noted that there is “no information” to properly confirm this at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo-Palworld lawsuit, which has been ongoing in Japan since its announcement in September 2024, involves three patents, two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters.

During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

                          <p>Bethesda provided flights from Chicago to New York City so that Ars could participate in the preview opportunity for Fallout 76: Burning Springs. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</p>
                      
          
<p>Like anybody, I have a few controversial gaming opinions and tastes. One of the most controversial is that<em> Fallout 76</em> —the multiplayer take on Bethesda's rethink of a beloved '90s open-world computer roleplaying game—has been my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/theres-never-been-a-better-time-to-get-into-fallout-76/">favorite online multiplayer game since its launch</a>.</p>
<p>As much as I like the game, though, I've been surprised that it has actually grown over the past seven years. I'm not saying it's seen a full, <em>No Man's Sky</em>-like redemption story, though. It's still not for everyone, and in some ways, it has fallen behind the times since 2018.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the success of the streaming TV show based on the game franchise has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">attracted new players</a>&nbsp;and given the developers a chance to seize the moment and attempt to complete a partial redemption story. To help make that happen, the game's developers will soon release an expansion fully capitalizing on that TV series for the first time, and I got to spend a few hours playing that update to see if it's any fun.</p>
<p>That said, don't get distracted by the shiny TV tie-in. The important work is a lot less flashy: combat overhauls, bug fixes, balance updates, quality-of-life improvements, and technological tweaks—all of which have been added to the game over time. Ultimately, that little stuff adds up to be more impactful than the big stuff for players.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let's take a quick look at where things stand based on my seven years of regularly playing the game and a few hours with the next major expansion.</p>
<h2>Months of combat and game balance overhauls</h2>
<p>You probably already know that the game originally launched without NPCs or the kinds of story- and character-driven quests most people expect from Fallout and that those things were added to the game in 2020, with more similar additions in the years since.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>You could make a case that the original, NPC-free vision made sense for a certain kind of player, but that's not the kind of player who tends to like Fallout games. Bethesda clearly pictured a <em>Rust</em>-like, emergent social PvP (player vs. player) situation when the game first came out. By now, though, PvP is almost completely absent from the game, and story-based quests loaded with NPCs are plentiful.</p>
<p>It still wasn't enough for some players. There were several small frustrations about gameplay balance, as some folks felt that combat wasn't always as fun as it could be and that the viable character builds in the endgame were too narrow.</p>
<p>Through a series of many patches over just this past year, Bethesda has been making significant changes to that aspect of the game. Go to Reddit and you'll see that some players have gripes—mainly because the changes nerfed some uber-powerful endgame builds and weapons to level the playing field. (Also, some recent changes to VATS are admittedly a double-edged sword, depending on your philosophy about what role it should play in the game.)</p>

<p>As someone who has been playing almost nonstop this whole time, though, I think the designers have done a great job of making more play styles viable while just generally making the game feel better to play. They also totally overhauled how the base-building system works. That's the sort of stuff that is hard to convey in a marketing blitz, but you feel it when you're playing.</p>
<p>I won't get into every detail about it here since most people reading this probably haven't played the game enough to warrant that, but you can look at <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news">the patch notes</a>—it's a lot.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>But I want to point that out up front because I think it's more important than anything in the actual expansion the developer and publisher are hyping up. The game is just generally more fun to play than it used to be—even a year ago. You love to see it.</p>
<h2>Technically, it’s a mixed bag</h2>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that the game has fallen behind the times in many ways. I'm mostly talking about its technical presentation and the lack of modern features players now expect from big-budget, cross-platform multiplayer games.</p>
<p>The assets are great, the art direction is top-notch, and the world is dense and attractive, but there are some now-standard AAA boxes it doesn't check. A full redemption story requires addressing at least some of these things to keep the game up to modern standards.</p>

      By and large, the game's environments look great on PC. Consoles are a bit behind.

<p>First up, the game has no executable for modern consoles; the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5/5 Pro consoles seem to run the last-gen Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Pro versions, respectively, just with the framerate cap (thankfully) raised from 30 fps to 60 fps.</p>
<p>But there's good news on that front: I spoke with development team members who confirmed that current-gen console versions are coming soon, though they didn't specify what kinds of upgrades we can expect.</p>
<p>I hope that also means a rethought approach to how the game displays on HDR (high dynamic range) TVs. To this day, HDR does not work like you'd expect; the game looks washed out on an OLED TV in particular, and there are none of the industry-standard HDR calibration sliders to fix it. HDR also didn't work properly in <em>Starfield</em> at launch (it got partially addressed about a year later), and it is completely absent from the otherwise gorgeous-to-behold <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster that came out just this year. I don't know what the deal is with Bethesda Game Studios and HDR, but I hope they figure it out by the time <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> hits.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I also asked the <em>Fallout 76</em> team about cross-play and cross-progression—the ability to play with friends on different platforms (or to at least access the same character across platforms). These features are likely nontrivial to implement, and they weren't standard in 2018. They're increasingly expected for big-budget, AAA multiplayer games today, though.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Bethesda devs I spoke to didn't have any plans to share on that front. Still, it's good to hear that the company still supports this game enough to at least launch modern console versions—and to continue adding major content updates.</p>
<h2>OK, we can talk about the TV show update now</h2>
<p>Speaking of major content updates, Bethesda is planning a big release called <em>Burning Springs</em> this December. It marks the second significant map expansion. Whereas the first expanded from the game's West Virginia locales southward into Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, this one pushes the map farther west, into the state of Ohio.</p>

<p>Ohio is a dust bowl now, it seems, so <em>Fallout 76</em> will see its first desert locale. That's an intentional choice, as the launch of this expansion will be timed closely to the release of season two of the TV show, and the show will be set in Nevada (specifically, around New Vegas). It obviously wouldn't make sense to expand the game's map all the way out to the western US, so this gives the developers a way to add a little season two flavor to <em>Fallout 76</em>.</p>
<p>As I was leaving my home to go to Bethesda's gameplay preview event for <em>Burning Springs</em>, my wife joked that they should add Walton Goggins to the game as the ultimate tie-in with the show. Funny enough, that's exactly what they've done. Goggins' character from the show, The Ghoul, can be found in the new Burning Springs region, and he voices the character. This game is a prequel to the show by many, many years, but fortunately, Ghouls don't age.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The Ghoul will give players repeatable bounty hunter missions of two types—one that you can handle solo and one that's meant to be done as a public event with other players.</p>

<p>I got to try both, and I found they were pretty fun, even though they don't go too far in breaking the mold of <em>Fallout 76</em>'s existing public events.</p>
<p>I also spent more than two hours freely exploring the game's post-apocalyptic interpretation of Ohio. Despite the new desert aesthetic, it's all pretty familiar Fallout stuff: raider-infested Super Duper Marts, blown-out neighborhoods, and the like. There is a very large new settlement that has a distinct character compared to the game's existing towns, and it's loaded with NPCs. I also enjoyed a public event that has players battling through a junkyard with a cyborg Deathclaw at their side—yep, you read that right.</p>
<p>I'm told there will be a new story quest line attached to the new region that involves a highly intelligent Super Mutant named the Rust King. I didn't get to do those quests during this demo, though.</p>
<p><em>Burning Springs</em> doesn't do anything to rethink <em>Fallout 76</em>'s basic experience; it's just more of it, with a different flavor. But since Bethesda has done so much work making that basic experience more fun, that's OK. It means more <em>Fallout 76</em> is, in fact, more of a good thing.</p>
<p>TV tie-ins don't fix a broken game, but they bring new or lapsed players back to a broken game that has since been fixed.</p>
<p>If you don't like looter shooters, survival crafting games, or the very idea of multiplayer games—and some Fallout players just don't—it's not going to change your mind. But if the reason you skipped this game or bounced off of it was that you liked what it was going for but felt it stumbled on the execution, it can't hurt to give it another try with the new update.</p>
<p>I don't think that's such a controversial opinion anymore. As a longtime player, it's nice to be able to say that.</p>

                <p>If you've held out on buying Rock Band 4 digitally in the past decade, you have less than a week to nab it. The multiplayer party rhythm game from Harmonix will be removed from the PlayStation and Xbox stores this coming Sunday, October 5, almost 10 years to the day after its release.</p><p>Harmonix producer Kyle Wynn shared news of the impending delisting on the official Rock Band Discord server, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1973380538250518687/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> on X. According to Wynn, "the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring," though anyone who owns the game digitally can still access and install it.</p><p>Wynn also added that DLC songs will follow suit, being delisted once they reach 10 years of digital shelf life; again, anyone who has purchased DLC songs will still retain them in their libraries. Rock Band 4's base game includes 65 songs, and DLC support, which included the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rock-band-4-expansion-rivals-out-now-alongside-new/1100-6444551/" data-ref-id="1100-6444551">Rivals expansion</a>, lasted until January 2024.</p><p>"If you’ve been meaning to grab a few last songs, now’s the time," Wynn said at the end of the announcement.</p><p>The expiration of music licenses is often the primary reason an older game is delisted, and it should come as no surprise that most of Harmonix's catalog of classic rhythm games has been unavailable on digital storefronts for some time.</p><p>For instance, Rock Band 3 was delisted in October 2015, five years after its launch. Of course, physical copies of these games are still playable and can be found on secondary markets.</p><p>Harmonix has been under the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-getting-musical-journeys-and-gameplay-with-epics-acquisition-of-rock-band-studio-harmonix/1100-6498299/" data-ref-id="1100-6498299">ownership of Epic Games since 2021</a>, leading development of the Rock Band-like Fortnite Festival game mode.

Thanks again,</p><p>—The Rock Band Team</p><p>The move comes after Harmonix <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/01/17/rock-band-4-dlc-ending-this-month">ceased DLC support for Rock Band 4</a> back in January 2024, with over 3,000 songs released weekly since the game's launch on October 6, &nbsp;2015. &nbsp;Rock Band 4 was well-received at launch, scoring an 8.75 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer, </em>and is the final traditional entry in the series, as 2017's&nbsp;<a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rock_band_vr/b/oculusrift/archive/2017/04/17/rock-band-vr-game-informer-review.aspx">Rock Band VR</a> followed it. The game received a single paid expansion, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/rock_band_4_rivals/b/playstation4/archive/2016/10/17/is-rock-band-4-rivals-worth-buying.aspx">Rock Band 4 Rivals</a>, in October 2016, which added new game modes (including a story mode) and, eventually, additional songs. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite Rock Band as a franchise dominating the early 2010s, the series' availability has gradually diminished due to expiring music licenses and the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/12/14/epic-shutting-down-online-services-for-several-unreal-tournament-and-rock-band-titles">shuttering of online services</a>. We'll be sad to see Rock Band 4 go, but those interested in picking up the game still have time to purchase the $9.99 Rock Band 4 Rivals bundle on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8802-CUSA02084_00-RB4RIVALSGAMEBDL">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/rock-band-4-rivals-bundle/BRS6ZCKHRNVX">Xbox </a>stores before it's pulled for good.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/01/rock-band-4-will-be-delisted-this-weekend]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I’m going to be honest here, I adore the Digimon games. Both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/19/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review/">Cyber Sleuth</a> and Hacker’s Memory were excellent games that let you push on with the story when you wanted to, or just choose to ignore it to make the most absurdly powerful Digimon your patience could manage. These aren’t world-changing games, they’re just a lot of fun, and the Digimon system of going up and down the evolutionary ladder to max out your stats and unlock new forms is one of the purest dopamine-delivery systems outside of Vampire Survivors. We’ve had to wait the better part of a decade for a sequel to those two games, but Digimon Story Time Stranger looks to continue that legacy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Digimon Story Time Stranger | Demo Available Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPBLhpfaklc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It shouldn’t be a huge surprise that I’m besotted with Digimon Story Time Stranger. Not only does it bring back the core systems from the previous Digimon Story titles, but it also irons out some of the needless creases, and then wraps a completely absurd plot around it. Seriously, the story in this game involves time paradoxes, parallel worlds, and chosen ones. Not to mention that you seem to be playing as an in-universe anime character, it’s wild. The story doesn’t always hit, but it’s cosy in an old-school RPG sort of way.</p>


<p>In a time where the other creature collector behemoth is trying to shift across to real time battling,&nbsp;Time Stranger continues with the tried and true turn-based combat of previous games, but this time you can activate agent skills to power up your team or deal damage to your foes. You can also equip your Digimon with different skills you can swap around to make sure every Digimon has a range of options to use. Digimon have elemental types, but they also have categories, and those both interact to determine strengths and weaknesses, so you really want a wide mix of options on your side.</p>


<p>As you fight, you level up and also get more information on enemies. You can eventually convert the scanned info from enemies into actual Digimon, and you can then use them and level them up, send them to the farm to train them there, keep them on your reserve team, or keep them in your bank, where they’ll still get experience points as you fight too. Of course, you can also feed them to other Digimon to make them stronger too, which is a nice way to use the excess you’ll end up with, so long as you don’t think about it too much.</p>
<p>You can then digivolve your critters once they’ve got the right stats, and once your Agent Rank is high enough – this essentially just goes up as you do more quests. To reach that tipping point, your creatures get passive boosts from fighting, of course, but also from the act of digivolving and de-digivolving back to previous forms. It means your monsters are constantly going up and down the evolutionary tree and exploring new branches in a way that’d make Darwin vomit… which is nice? You can now handle this from the menus whenever and wherever you are, instead of always having to return to the hub. This makes it all feel a lot smoother, and with all the gains you get elsewhere, you can basically ignore the Digimon Farm completely if you want to.</p>

<p>To take a brief break from all the compliments, there is some weird monetisation built into Digimon Story Time Stranger. Beyond what is promised for the DLC season pass, there are special dungeons you can go into that apparently give loads of experience, gold, and materials, but you have to buy them separately and they weren’t available before launch for us to dig into. I don’t love it, and the only saving grace is that you really don’t need these dungeons to make good progress.</p>
<p>Visually, the game’s gorgeous. It’s got a lovely anime style to it, and the variety of environments you visit is incredible. You’ll see all sorts of biomes and get to talk to a preposterous number of Digimon as well. It sounds amazing too, as the soundtrack changes with each area and really helps set the tone. It’s not bouncing light beams all over the place, but I really like it.</p>

<p>Along with all of that, the ability to speed up fights and even automate them allows you to treat this more like a management game if you want to. It certainly helps you to race through some of the grind, in a way that has often been retrofit into JRPG remasters. As a distraction, there’s&nbsp; even a card game in it you can muck about with, though it’s not especially deep and probably won’t keep you distracted from the main focus of raising and battling Digimon. Let’s be honest, that’s the main reason you’re here, isn’t it?</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really, really like Digimon Story Time Stranger. While it's hardly upending the monster collection and battling genre, it's a really comfortable and enjoyable game that feels&nbsp;reminiscent of watching Saturday morning cartoons as a kid. It's an awful lot of fun, and is right up there as one of my favourite games of the year.	</p></div>
