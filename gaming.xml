			<p>A new playable demo of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Unreal Engine 5.5. fan made remake by CryZENx is now available for download, allowing fans to experience another remade portion of the classic game by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/116896739?utm_campaign=postshare_creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, features a short sequence starting with the Ging Dodongo fight and ending shortly after reaching the Great Fairy and getting the magic bar. What makes these short sequences impressive is the accurate recreation of both the visuals and gameplay mechanics of the classic, making this demo a must-play for those wanting to experience a small portion of the classic entry in the series in a modernized way.</p>
<p>The Zelda: Ocarina of Time Unreal Engine 5.5. remake creator CryZENx also shared a video showcasing the demo. You can find it right below.</p>

<p>CryZENx has been working on this The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Unreal Engine 5 remake for a good while, showing time and time again what an <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-remake-comparison/">excellent job they are doing</a>. While there's no doubt Nintendo would shut down the project if it were ever released as a full game, hopefully, the Japanese company will take note of it and release a proper, modern remake of the game for one of its future gaming systems.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dave-the-diver-sales-top-5m.1048035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Mintrocket has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, further cementing the diving adventure's popularity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DaveDiverGame/status/1862090754769998006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Mintrocket confirms that&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>has sold five million copies, thanking players for all of their "love and support". The studio also posts a lyric that appears to be a reference to&nbsp;Bruno Mars and Rosé's song "Apt", namely "sleep tomorrow but tonight go diving".</p>

<p>In January this year, Mintrocket revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-3-million" rel="nofollow">had hit three million</a>, so that means that in the intervening months (since not even a year has passed since that announcement), the game has gone on to sell another two million copies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-sales-5m-diving.jpg?itok=N0Rs-DBQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-sales-5m-diving.jpg?itok=aQFuvLbS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's been a strong year for&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in sales terms, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>That number is especially impressive if we consider two things. First,&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Xbox, so all of these sales have come from PC, Switch, and PlayStation.</p>

<p>Secondly, when&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-ps5-release-date-ps-plus" rel="nofollow">launched on PS5 back in April</a>, it also hit PlayStation Plus on day one, so subscribers have the chance to play the game at no extra cost. Even still, many have clearly bought the game rather than taking to Sony's subscription service to check it out.</p>

<p>Of course, Mintrocket doesn't provide an exact breakdown of where the sales have come from in its post, so we don't know what proportion of those sales are PlayStation and how many are PC players.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em>, it's an adventure game-come-management sim in which you play as the titular Dave. You must dive into the ocean to gather ingredients and explore the world by day, then manage your sushi restaurant by night.</p>

<p>The game, which was developed by Nexon division Mintrocket, sparked some debate when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-nominees-announced-baldurs-gate-3-alan-wake-2-are-most-nominated" rel="nofollow">nominated for Best Indie Game</a> at the 2023 Game Awards, although it eventually lost to Sabotage's JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>.</p>

<p>Still, since Nexon <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nexon-spins-off-dave-the-diver-dev-mintrocket-into-a-full-corporation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spun Mintrocket off into its own entity</a> in September (albeit one that's still a subsidiary), perhaps that indie label is slightly more warranted now. I'd argue not, but there we are.</p>

<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is available to check out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <p>You can now knock down enemy dirtbags using a dinner plate as a violent frisbee in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a>. Wonderful. The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how <em>she's over there</em>, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX. It also adds a whole new game mode and plenty of other tweaks. The bad news is that some story bits are now delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First things first - the new "Special Campaign" mode is basically the shooter's equivalent of new game plus. It will let players replay the campaign (as it exists so far) "but with unique Endgame Content and Randomization," say developers Altered Orbit in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4702411539870497570">the update post</a>. It'll add random enemy encounters and give weapons ARPG style rarity colours, among other tweakable settings.</p>
<p>There were plans to call this "Randomizer" mode but it seems the devs have redesigned and rebranded it. As with classic examples of new game plus, you'll need to have already completed the game to unlock this new special mode (or, in this case, chapter one of the campaign - what exists of the game so far). </p>
<p>But more fun than this new mode, for me, are the ways the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a>-like enemy patrol goons have been further improved. Like I've mentioned, they'll fall over when you throw a plate at them, but also now stumble if you blast them in the leg. They'll take increased damage when frozen by frosty grenades, and make more callouts to one another when looking for the player (for example, they will now yell about your flashlight giving you away). </p>

<p>There's a miscellany of other improvements, such as snappier Halo-style melee attacks, and a bunch of balancing to various firearms. There are also many bug fixes. "Throwing toilets against enemies no longer crashes the game," we're told. "Fixed a rare bug where enemies killed by electricity would instead become invincible." God, I love patch notes.</p><p>As for the noise - there's more of that too. "Improved oomph for Fire Extinguisher explosions," yell the patch notes enthusiastically. "Improved sound effect when walking over glass," another note screams. "Went nuts on the audio design for bullet impacts and whizzes," a third note whispers, but with a manic and delighted look that implies there is a landmine nearby. Don't worry, the mine's explosive radius has been nerfed by almost 50%. You'll be fine.</p>
<p>It's a fairly hefty update, which the developer cites as the reason for a delay in the story stuff that was planned to get players closer to their protagonist. Narrative additions they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noisy-shooter-selaco-is-steam-deck-verified-with-new-story-stuff-ai-improvements-and-randomizer-modes-in-the-works">previously mentioned</a> include "a major voice-over pass to flesh out Dawn as a character, the world of Selaco and the general plot". That was planned for the end of this year, but it's been pushed back a couple months to January or February next year, say the devs. In the meantime, work on the second chapter of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> "continues to progress rapidly," they say, dropping hints of deployable turrets, miniguns, and... is that a mech suit? Interesting.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>If Selaco's many additions and alterations are sometimes difficult to follow, it's partly because the devs don't use a roadmap like other studios might during early access. "Roadmaps tend to have a negative effect on development/work," they've <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791469846912&amp;emgid=4374768959778727710">said in the past</a>. "Experimentation with new ideas takes time, while roadmaps are schedule-focused and don't allow for such things."</p><p>However they're doing things, it seems to be working just fine. Ed liked Selaco when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/selaco-early-access-review">reviewed the first early access build</a>, calling it a work of impressive "GZDoom wizardry" and praising those cunning AI enemies. Here's what he had to say about the running and/or gunning.</p>
<blockquote>Firefights are a festival of debris, where it rains printer paper and computer monitors crackle and alien troops coat everything in a sticky purple gunk when you explode them. While the result of your bullets can be quite chaotic, gunfights straddle the line between tactical and balls-to-the-wall boomer shooter really well...</blockquote>
<p>It's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">discounted in Steam's Autumn sale</a>, if you like a bit of noise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Palestinian developer Rasheed Abueideh has announced Dreams On A Pillow, a mixture of stealth-adventure and interactive documentary set during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba">Nakba</a> - Israel's violent displacement and dispossession of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, shortly after Israel's founding. Created by "a global team of veteran game developers", it's the story of a Palestinian woman grappling with the loss of her baby after fleeing a bloody assault on her town. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Here's a description of the game, via press release.
</p>
<blockquote>"Dreams on a Pillow is a pseudo-3D Stealth-Adventure game based on the true Palestinian folktale of Omm - a Palestinian mother who fled the massacre of her town with her new-born child. After running for an hour in sheer panic, she realized that she had carried a pillow to safety, instead of her child. Inspired by the story, Dreams on a Pillow explores Omm's life story, showcasing both the history of Palestine before the ethnic cleansing of the lands, and the trauma borne from the violence that was inflicted upon the Palestinian people during the Nakba."</blockquote>

<p>
According to the announcement materials, Omm's journey as a refugee takes her through the sites of several atrocities, including concentration camps and attacks on Palestinians near the Lebanese border. Whenever she is able to rest, the game switches into a documentary mode, "reliving a rapidly fading memory of a pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">Zionist</a> Palestine" by means of archive imagery and text. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/2_L9jSxaj.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rasheed Abueideh</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Omm's principle possession is the pillow, which serves as both a terrible reminder of her lost child and a kind of coping device. When carrying it, she's not able to interact with objects or do things like jump, crawl, throw rocks and climb ladders. Putting the pillow down, however, triggers Omm's guilt and trauma, provoking nightmares that "reveal dangers of the mind, and shroud the dangers of the real world". The immediate practical challenge during the stealth-adventure sections, then, is to complete whatever objectives are at hand and retrieve the pillow before Omm's delusions overwhelm her.
</p><p>
Abueideh is the developer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liyla_and_the_Shadows_of_War">Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War</a>, a freeware game released for PC and mobile in 2016, which follows a Palestinian family's struggle to survive during Israel's 2014 war on the Palestinian territory of Gaza. The game <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/liyla-shadows-war-game-gaza-strip-palestine-israel/">drew headlines</a> when Apple initially refused to list it in the Games section of the Apple Store, requesting that it be categorised under "News" or "Reference" instead. They reversed their decision a week later following an outcry and accusations of double standards with regard to games about or by Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>
While Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War has won or been nominated for several awards, Abueideh says he has struggled to make headway in the industry ever since, something he attributes to publisher wariness of the politically sensitive subject of Israel's long-running occupation of Palestinian territories. He says it has proven "impossible" to find a traditional publisher for Dreams On A Pillow, nor has he been able to muster the funds independently. After releasing Liyla &amp; The Shadows of War, Abueideh opened a nut roastery in his home town of Nablus in the Palestinian West Bank, but he says it's now unsafe to visit the building due to the nearby activity of Israeli colonists. 
</p>
<p>
As such, Abueideh is <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/dreams_on_a_pillow">crowd-funding the game via the LaunchGood platform</a>. He says he's using LaunchGood, which focuses specifically on projects from Muslim people, "because most popular crowdfunding platforms do not recognize Palestine".
</p>
<p>
The announcement of Dreams On A Pillow comes in the middle of open warfare between the Israeli armed forces and Hamas, the government of Gaza. The current conflict began in October 2023, when Hamas struck across the border and killed over a thousand people, while taking 251 people hostage. Since then, Israel has carried out a ground invasion and bombing campaign that has killed well over 40,000 Gazans and injured or displaced hundreds of thousands more. 
</p><p>
In the process, Israel has <a href="https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2024/01/widescale-destruction-of-cultural-heritage-in-gaza/">destroyed</a> many Palestinian cultural institutions and sites, including universities, libraries and museums. While set many decades before, Dreams On A Pillow is an assertion of Palestinian heritage and rights in response to this on-going erasure. It aims to shore up connections between present bloodshed and the violence of the Nakba, while rebutting what the LaunchGood page terms "the common propaganda myth" of Palestine as a "land without people" prior to Israel's founding.

		<p>It’s the actual day of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday 2024</a>, but let’s be honest, most of the sales have been going on for at least a week, and they’re maybe not so great this year? Still,&nbsp;tech savvy gamers will be scouring the internet today for the best deals on games, accessories and upgrades for their gaming hobby, and now’s also a good chance to get in some Christmas shopping, if you already know what you’re getting someone.</p>
<p>We’ve cruised around the internet to find some of the best UK Black Friday deals on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> games, accessories and SSD upgrades.</p>


<h3>Get the PS5 DualSense for just £36</h3>
<p>The PS5 DualSense controller has been officially reduced to £45 by Sony, but you can get it for £36 instead. ShopTo is a part of eBay’s Black Friday promotion – use code BLACKFRIDAY20 for 20% off the listed price – which brings that £45 down to just £36. This is actually a bargain when the RRP is £60! You’ll want to be quick</p>


<p>You can also get the DualSense Edge at £170, vs. Sony’s sale price of £190</p>

<h3>Add some PS5 storage with these SSDs</h3>
<p>Are you feeling a bit constrained by the storage space you have in the PS5? Well PS5 compatible 1TB and 2TB SSDs are pretty economical these days, thanks to the wealth of chipsets and brands getting in on the game. It helps that console gaming basically just needs good read speeds, so you can get away with DRAM-less drives and lower endurance on writes.</p>
<p>We’ve highlighted the Netac NV7000, a very cheap drive <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/ssd-specs/netac-nv7000-1-tb.d896">most likely based on the InnoGrit controller</a>, MSI Spatium M482 and Corsair MP600 both using the Phison E27T chipset, and the in-house controllers and designs from Crucial and Western Digital – the SN850X is still one of the most highly regarded NVMe drives.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454431">Pop an SSD in yer PS5, why don’tcha?</p>
<p>All offers are available on Amazon were, if needed, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ELUTENG-Heatsink-Double-Sided-Aluminum-Cooling/dp/B07RZ8BJ92/">a cheap but effective heatsink for under £7.</a></p>

<h2>Top up on PS Plus with up to 30% off this Black Friday</h2>
<p>There’s “up to 30% off” the three <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> 12 month subscription tiers – that’s across Essential, Extra or Premium – and current subscribers can also discounts when upgrading to a higher tier. These deals aren’t as good as in years gone by, but here are the new prices through 2nd December:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation Plus Essential 12 months – £48</li>
<li>PlayStation Plus Extra 12 months – £75</li>
<li>PlayStation Plus Premium 12 months – £84</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make this cheaper by using PS Store gift cards – at best, a <a href="https://www.shopto.net/en/dls55596-playstation-wallet-top-up-50-00-p52491/">£40 gift card is £34</a> (15% off), or <a href="https://www.shopto.net/en/dls55111415-playstation-store-gift-card-70-ps5-ps4-psn-uk-account-p1181464/">£70 is £59.50</a> (15% off) from ShopTo, cutting a good few quid more off the price.</p>
<h2>Grab some PS5 games on disc</h2>
<p>Remember discs? Shiny on the one side, printy on the other? Sure, you can obviously check out the PlayStation Store digital sale this Black Friday, but it’s still often better value to go and grab some of the spinny ones.</p>
<p>There’s pretty healthy discounts on a broad spectrum of games, including Star Wars Outlaws under £35, Helldivers 2 for £20, Dragon’s Dogam 2 for £33 and more. In all these cases, you’re saving at least £5 by getting physical, and usually a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ve spotted:</p>

<h2>Get 4 months of free Apple TV+ at Currys</h2>
<p>If you’re weighing up buying a game or accessory from Currys, then know that they’re also giving 4 months of Apple TV+ with every online purchase (new and returning customers only, and that have not redeemed a similar Apple services offer with Currys in the past).</p>
<h2>Get better sound with a gaming headset</h2>
<p>This one’s basically essential for any horror game fan, but a gaming headset can really accentuate the experience across all games, thanks to PS5’s built in spatial audio.</p>
<p>The Sony Pulse Gaming Earbuds are reduced to <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/gaming-accessories/playstation-5-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds/p/232977">£140 at Smyths Toys</a>, while their newer Pulse Elite headset is <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/gaming-accessories/playstation-5-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset/p/232976">£100 at Smyths</a> if you prefer over ear cans.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something a bit more budget friendly, then the new design <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2 is a solid shout</a> is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Turtle-Beach-PlayStation-Wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B0CYWJJLBY/ref=sr_1_11?crid=3DAASBIBF3MCX&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JjAa9-1l-5vx8mDNkDZyKsWYjpV7m10eDexLCx1wyn6HWuSx7kY3Jf3Fr0v4RlkFJNawN0Gl743wwqIovRq16XwxL2nKdts196GhV-mJKH4bdq5Q-qk27srxyGF0FDKPtQtBTXOJ0g7GVdCdScV2R7hlVluTOJUVeqbBChRE80YdDBeot6iyAOZootSDRUurjWwTVNuVz7hfndrtNcFhb03jqkqpoh7BSu4TmS1ypmw.wppNVeTZdQdHj2HDx__desyF5rXwPqZFXQOx1jWGMmM&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=gaming%2Bheadset%2Bwireless&amp;psr=EY17&amp;qid=1732880344&amp;s=black-friday&amp;sprefix=gaming%2Bheadset%2Bwireless%2Cblack-friday%2C109&amp;sr=1-11&amp;th=1">£57 at Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4840345?clickSR=slp:term:stealth%20500:2:442:1">£58 at Argos</a> or <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/turtle-beach-stealth-500-wireless-gaming-headset-black-10264931.html">£60 at Currys&nbsp;</a>(with that Apple TV+ offer)</p>

<p>And looking a bit up market, the Steelseries Arctis Nova 7 range is their upper-mid tier headset. We’d recommend the 7X, which supports Xbox consoles officially, but also has compatibility with PlayStation using the USB dongle, but you might dislike the green accents, so you might prefer the all-black Nova 7 headset or the blue accented Nova 7P. It’s now available for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SteelSeries-Arctis-Nova-7X-Multi-System/dp/B0B7X8M694?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_caaeea47_79">£110 at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-nova-7x">£129 at Steelseries</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Fortnite has yet to officially upload the trailer; however, <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data miners</a> have been able to find it within the game files.</p>



<p>The new gameplay trailer for Chapter 6 reveals new skins, bosses, and Godzilla, who seemingly walks around the map. It’s currently unclear if Godzilla is a boss or not within Chapter 6.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red.1048005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt joint CEO Michał Nowakowski announced the next game in The Witcher franchise - otherwise known as Project Polaris and unofficially referred to by most as just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - has finally entered what he described as "full-scale production - the most intensive phase of development".</p>
<p>It's good news for Witcher fans of course, although information remains incredibly thin when it comes to what exactly we can expect from the game itself, or even when we might hear more. All that's been publicly shared so far is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">early-phase development was confirmed back in March of 2022</a>; that the game won't "focus" on previous protagonist Geralt of Rivia; and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Geralt's voice actor, Doug Cockle, will still be "part of" the new game</a> in some way.</p>
<p>But having spoken to a number of people from CD Projekt - including Nowakowski - over the past year for our long-read on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">what happened with Cyberpunk 2077 and how the studio turned it around</a>, there are a few little nuggets of info we can share that might help piece together some extra context.</p>
<p>First up, a bit of chatter about process - albeit chatter that leads into a few other little hints at what we can expect about how things are going. One of the few other tidbits of already-public information is that CD Projekt Red has moved away from its own bespoke, internal REDengine to the more widely-adopted Unreal, which is owned by Epic Games.</p><p>"I know a lot of people are curious about it, so I'll try to explain," CDPR's vice president of technology, Charles Tremblay told me earlier this year, wryly joking that the decision has been a "very polarising question in general, for the company and for everyone". He explained that, contrary to popular belief, the REDengine wasn't the specific cause of the studio's troubles with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s development, and nor was its severely troubled launch the key reason for the switch.</p>
<p>"The first thing I want to say again, to be sure, 100 percent clear, is that the whole team, myself included, are extremely proud of the engine we built for Cyberpunk. So it is not about, 'This is so bad that we need to switch' and, you know, 'Kill me now' - that is not true. That is not true, and this is not why the decision was made to switch."</p>
<p>Instead, it came down to the developer wanting to have multiple projects in development at once - namely the next Witcher game, the further-off Cyberpunk sequel codenamed Orion, and the still distant new IP codenamed Hadar. "The way we built stuff in the past was very one-sided, like one project at a time. We pushed the limit - but also we saw that if we wanted to have a multi-project at the same time, building in parallel, sharing technology together, it is not easy," he said.</p>

<p>The other factor was that the developer felt it could benefit from "having a good partnership with Epic, and working together on the technology," as Tremblay put it. "We can also help them to achieve their vision, to do open world game[s], and also they can help us too, from some technical perspectives, on some of the aspects that we would like them [to] and that we would like to not have to be focusing on too much - because in the end, we are game company, right?" In other words, it's a decision made with the intention of getting more of CDPR's developers working on the games themselves.</p><p>"So the idea was that we can push the technology, we can finally have all the technical people in the company working together on different projects, rather than super centralised into one technology that can very difficultly be shared between other projects.</p>
<p>"We can share expertise, share people, share knowledge. And also we wanted to be sure that we developed some of the technology correctly this time around - with our expertise, we know how to do things with the experience we had in the past, and now it's time to actually make it shareable across all the groups."</p>
<blockquote>"It will be better than Cyberpunk - because for us, it [was] unacceptable"</blockquote>
<p>One of the major lessons for CD Projekt after its issues with Cyberpunk 2077 was the studio's difficulty with balancing its ambition - and confidence in delivering on that ambition that bordered on "magical thinking," as joint CEO Nowakowski put it to me - with the realities of the studio's rapid growth and surprise obstacles of Covid-19. But Trembley, as with many other developers at CDPR, maintained that the team's ambition itself remains undimmed.</p>
<p>"Again, I will not say it's easy," he added, "but I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase [of the technology]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious," he said. "And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>, it will be better than Cyberpunk - because for us, it's unacceptable [to launch that way]. We don't want to go back.</p><p>"Even if there will be some 'sweaty moments' and maybe even some bad stuff happening, still, I think that we will try everything we can to make it even more than what we achieved in the past years. So the technology should not be a blocker for us, basically."</p>
<p>Coming back to the next Witcher game moving up to "full-scale production", Tremblay also explained part of what that process looks like for CDPR. Tremblay's recent role, since moving up from being very much "in the trenches" on Cyberpunk 2077, has been to "pretty much oversee the tech development across all the products," as he described it. One aspect of that includes speaking with the various game directors across the studio's projects in North America and Europe, reviewing "what they are doing, challenging [them], approving when we go," and then making "recommendations to the board" about whether the studio is ready to press on with a project on the technical side of things.</p>
<p>This is a new process CDPR brought in as part of its response to the Cyberpunk launch, with the studio allowing more time for pre-production, and conducting regular reviews on whether the technology is ready for each individual project to move forward - including, in some cases, delaying that step where necessary.</p>
<p>"How it works in what we're doing," Tremblay explains, is "basically we have different stages of the project, where we have different requirements for tech. Then basically, with me and the tech directors, we nail down - we agree on 'this is what we want to nail' - and we work together to make sure this happens."</p><p>Then, "if we want to go into pre-production, we will prepare all the tooling to scale up the production and the [number of] content people. If it's not ready, or it's just a specific thing that is not ready, then we can discuss, okay, what can we do next? How are we going to approach it? And we can also discuss [whether] to delay - delay not as in delay release, but delay in terms of like, before we scale up production. And then we go to the board or the other people, and we discuss the reason why. And usually it's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>"It's easy to discuss in a very pragmatic approach, like: 'This is why. The reason we cannot go forward with different environments, with the production, is because this, this, they are not ready. And if we do so, we'll pay later - because everything they do will not work, or we'll have to go as [with Cyberpunk], catch up during production.' We do not want to do that again."</p>
<p>He suggested "a good example would be like, console [builds] not working. So having the console working super late, it's unacceptable anymore, and it's part of our process. So we do the reviews on console, so we know exactly where we are on all the platforms - the lower platforms we have - rather than, you know, 'Oh PC is fine, so we can go forward'. So we changed this approach to have a broader visibility on the other platforms we want to have."</p>
<blockquote>"Most likely, we will not have a PC only launch"</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the next major game's launch, Tremblay also gave a rough steer on what the studio's strategy will be when it comes to those additional platforms. One of Cyberpunk 2077's major development struggles came from issues with last-gen consoles and their hard drive read-write speeds, for instance. I asked whether CDPR would consider an approach similar to that Larian took with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, where it launched on PC first, and then consoles a few months later to buy a little more time. (Ironically, Larian boss Swen Vincke later explained this was partially also to avoid some major releases at the time, including Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion.)</p>
<p>"It's something we discussed, actually," Tremblay told me, "but we're not 100 percent sure. Maybe - so it's hard to say if we want to go this way at this stage. I would assume that as long as I understand, like, the strategy we want to do - I'm just trying not to say too much, bear with me - most likely, the launch, we will not have a PC-only launch, for example. I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p><p>Meanwhile, Paweł Sasko, who was lead quest designer on The Witcher 3 and is now the associate game director on Project Orion, Cyberpunk 2077's sequel, also shared a bit of extra context on CD Projekt's development team sizes and timeframes, firstly in the case of Project Hadar, the studio's new IP.</p>
<blockquote>[Hadar]'s in its early stages, right?</blockquote>
<p>I spoke with Sasko twice for Eurogamer's big Cyberpunk 2077 article, the first time as far back as spring of 2023, the second in the spring again of this year. Back in 2023, Sasko described the Hadar team as "incredibly tiny - well, not incredibly tiny; it's a small group of people that are putting like, a small concept board into that. And it will become a game, because you need to slowly get there, but it's in its early stages, right? It's not a full blown production where we have like a 600-people team on it."</p>
<p>Come spring 2024, there was a smidge more detail, noting Hadar was still "in early stages, so in that ideation phase, or however you call it - it requires constant communication, bouncing ideas."</p>
<p>The Boston-based team that's focused on the Cyberpunk sequel meanwhile is what he described as "a pretty tight core team composed out of the directors that have been shipping Cyberpunk and Phantom Liberty." Part of the studio's decision to set up there - alongside proximity to some top universities and tech companies for recruitment, and the ability to become "one of the biggest players" on the US' east coast - was to straddle the timezones of Vancouver, which houses a CDPR studio composed of "mostly engineers," and Warsaw, which is now "mostly art". The Cyberpunk sequel team remains "fairly small for triple-A," he said at the time.</p><p>Thirdly and finally with Sasko, there was a little discussion of The Witcher studio. "That team is probably the biggest team, the team that took all The Witcher, Cyberpunk devs on board, and is working on their game. I don't know, certainly, the exact number," he added. "It's like a couple hundred there," as of around late March this year.</p>
<p>Notably, that's a fair bit earlier than this recent announcement that full-scale production had begun. It's tempting to infer that fairly significant pre-production work has been going on for a little while before that public confirmation, but then it's worth remembering Tremblay's explanation of how that new process works: it may be that this time has been spent getting the technological side of things ready before full development started in earnest. Likewise, a few hundred isn't as big as it sounds for CDPR these days: while around 300 people worked on The Witcher 3, 350 developers worked on Phantom Liberty alone. The studio now employs something in the region of 1400 people worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>"There's no magic, only hard work and making sure you stay on the right course"</blockquote>
<p>Sticking with inferences, there's also one more bit of information we might be able to glean, this time from a conversation with joint CEO Michał Nowakowski. Like a lot of developers I spoke to from CD Projekt Red, he described his mindset on the studio's future releases.</p>
<p>"Optimistic. I feel optimistic because I'm, in general, an optimistic person," he said. "But on the on the more realistic side - I think that's actually part of why I'm optimistic - is I think we are aware, as an organisation, that, let's say what was one [example] with Phantom Liberty coming back to 95 percent, currently 94 percent [positive Steam reviews], nothing is granted forever. And I think it's something that it's important for us to understand. And I think also for all the people in the company: there's no magic. There's only hard work and making sure you stay on the right course."</p><p>With future games, he added, "with the Witcher or you know, with Cyberpunk in the future, it's only down to us. Everything can fail, but it's our role to make sure it doesn't. And remembering and understanding that I think is the biggest reason for me to be optimistic, because in the company everyone's constantly worried - but worried in a good way, if you know what I mean. Worried that we are going to do it in a good enough way? 'Are we, for sure, not letting something slip through our fingers?' And if you're that kind of worried, I think that gives us better chances of being successful in the future than thinking we can't fail because we're too big, or too whatever - you know, noses up our somethings."</p>
<p>One of the specific lessons the studio took from Cyberpunk, which has particular relevance here, to bring things back to the next announcement, was to be "smarter in how we want to announce and kick off marketing campaigns," Nowakowski told me.</p>
<p>"To be honest, when we were kicking off the marketing campaign officially with pre-orders, which was the Keanu on stage [moment, at E3 in June 2019], the plan was actually to launch roughly one year later. It just didn't really work. So we didn't really plan for like a two-year campaign, and I still think that one year would really be fine [in terms of] time for a promotional campaign of that game."</p>
<blockquote>"For a new game, expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - campaign"
</blockquote>
<p>The studio "learned a lot of good practices from that experience: so announce the date when you're like really, really sure of it. And now I think we have much better tools to be sure of that date, which we - on a smaller scale - proved to ourselves with Phantom Liberty." While that campaign lasted around six months, given it was only an expansion, Nowakowski added that "for a new game, we would still expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - lasting campaign."</p>
<p>"Having said that," he added, "I want to stress: it doesn't mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]. Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p><p>For example, he continued, "If I ask you, what do you know about The Witcher 4? The answer is not much, probably - yes, there's theories and so on. But there's nothing really specific. So we want to drop the crumbs here and there so that people - and the media as well - can, you know, pick up on it and try to figure out what it is we're trying to say this time. So that [is something] we can start doing a little bit earlier." That would involve aspects such as "having some video assets, or something to whet the appetite of the fans - not even to create the hype so much," he said, as to simply get the early conversations flowing.</p>
<p>Another note on platforms, too: another thing the studio took from the mistakes of Cyberpunk 2077 was what Nowakowski described as "the focus on the target platform" during marketing from the off. "I think what put us into a lot of trouble is how late we started with PS4 and the Xbox [One] back in the day, and we don't ever want to be in that same spot again."</p>
<p>What can we take from that? Well, expect at least a year - but most likely less than two years - between The Witcher 4's proper reveal and its actual launch. Expect, possibly, some light teases or short trailers a little earlier than that. We probably shouldn't expect a firm commitment to platforms early on, nor a PC-only release - although plans can of course always change - and hopefully, if Phantom Liberty is a guide and if those lessons truly have been learned, expect CD Projekt Red to launch The Witcher 4 a lot closer to the first release date it gives.</p>
<p>Purely to speculate: the Game Awards, known for their hefty emphasis on major reveal trailers and teases, are just around the corner, too, and CD Projekt has put some weight behind Keighley-powered events such as Summer Games Fest before, most notably with Phantom Liberty. We might see the first of those breadcrumbs quite soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just made its Chapter 6 launch trailer available to view in-game, revealing fresh details about the evergreen battle royale's latest revamp.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-estimated-release-date">Chapter 6 isn't due to launch until this weekend</a>, following Saturday night's big Remix live event finale starring Eminem and Snoop Dogg, so the upload of a trailer in-game now looks like an unfortunate slip-up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the internet has now pounced on the trailer, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">confirms the towering Godzilla as an enormous boss</a> that roams around Fortnite's fresh new Japan-inspired map. 
</p>
<p>
There are also smaller bosses - a huge samurai, a floating demon mask - as well as a giant turtle. Hopefully we don't have to shoot the giant turtle.

<p>
On an even smaller scale, Fortnite looks to be introducing some kind of cute jelly thing as a pet? Previous artwork showed what looked like pet-like creatures, including a cute-looking dragon, hanging out on characters' shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Oh and finally: Big Hero 6's Baymax - part of the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass - will get to do his 'Balalala' thing as an emote.
</p>
<p>
Despite Chapter 6 being a big revamp for Fortnite, there's actually a fair amount here that feels familiar. Samurai swords are back but look similar to their usage in the game previously. Some of the architecture here looks similar to the Japanese-themed biome back on the Chapter 4 map. And the towering Godzilla boss, let's be honest, feels a little similar to the towering Doctor Doom live event. Although this time with fire breath.
</p>
<p>
We're expecting much more to be officially revealed about Fortnite's future this weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Next week, Chapter 6's launch will be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">the arrival of the game's Fortnite OG mode</a> - that brings back Fortnite's beloved original map as a permanent addition <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">with its own battle pass</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-black-friday-deal-halves-price-of-3-month-premium-memberships/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Friday has arrived even for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. This week only, GFN users from the free tier (or even newcomers) can upgrade to either Performance or Ultimate memberships for a three-month subscription at half the normal price. This means you'll pay $4.99 monthly for the Performance tier and $9.99 monthly for the Ultimate tier instead of the usual $9.99 and $19.99. As a reminder, the Performance tier is the rebranded Priority tier that was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-upgrades-geforce-now-middle-tier-but-introduces-100-hour-monthly-playtime-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">given</a> a resolution upgrade from 1080p to 1440p. However, NVIDIA also announced plans to introduce a 100-hour monthly playtime cap starting January 1, 2025 for new customers, while every active paid number as of December 31, 2024 will be able to continue avoiding the cap until January 2026, provided that they maintain an active subscription.</p>
<p>As part of the Black Friday deals, GeForce NOW members can also redeem a 30% discount from SteelSeries to purchase the <a href="https://fave.co/4idOI7x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stratus+</a> or <a href="https://fave.co/3Zd0h6b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nimbus+</a> controllers for Android or iOS devices, respectively. To redeem the discount, opt-in to GeForce NOW rewards and look out for an email with details. Do note that this exclusive offer cannot be combined with other SteelSeries promotions.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a GeForce NOW update without some new games added to the ever-growing list of over 2K compatible titles. This week, players can start enjoying the following games on NVIDIA's cloud:</p>
<p>● New Arc Line (New release on Steam, Nov. 26)<br>
● MEGA MAN X DiVE Offline Demo (Steam)<br>
● PANICORE (Steam)<br>
● Resident Evil 7 Teaser: Beginning Hour Demo (Steam)<br>
● Slime Rancher (Steam)<br>
● Sumerian Six (Steam)</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a hands-on preview of the steampunk fantasy cRPG New Arc Line earlier this month, following the game's debut on early access.</p>
<p><em>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. However, you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm eager to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</em></p>

<p>Following a controversial reveal, Polaris Quest revealed 16 minutes of Light of Motiram gameplay.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was heavily criticized yesterday following its reveal due to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/">striking resemblanc</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/"> to the Horizon series</a>. Since the initial reveal though, 16 minutes of new gameplay of the game has been revealed, showing the game in somewhat of a different light.</p>



<p>You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="騰訊曝光《荒野起源》15 分鐘實機展示 未來將與 PlayStation 有更多合作" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsq1xnd0CvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It’s fairly obvious that the developers have been heavily inspired (if not just blatantly ripped off) by the Horizon series, but after watching the gameplay, you also see some inspiration taken from other games like ARK and Souls.</p>



<p>The gameplay has left people conflicted. Some think the game looks impressive, whereas others think it’s just an unoriginal idea that borrows concepts and designs from other games.</p>



<p>“I think you can’t be more unoriginal than this,” said YouTube user Xezene on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqwoP_cTo4I&amp;t=502s&amp;ab_channel=Gematsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reupload of the gameplay</a>. “This looks fantastic,” said YouTube user MrMultiPlatform.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram has been announced to be released sometime in 2025 on PC.</p>

            <p>We’ll chat about what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-frostpunk-2-its-not-the-cold-thats-your-enemy-but-human-nature">Frostpunk 2</a>’s new roadmap is bringing to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> in a second, but first, here are some other genres with the -punk suffix I would like to see brought to fruition soon:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>Pastrypunk (A sort of Great British Bake Off meets The Running Man murder gameshow)</li>
<li>Beepunk (A gritty post-apocalypse following a catastrophic pandemic that only beekeepers were able to survive due to those funny hats they wear)</li>
<li>Jinglepunk (Christmassy!)</li>
<li>Tescopunk (in which a series of mergers leaves a single surviving Big Tesco and its management as the true underdog in the future corporate forever wars)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even one of these would make me very happy, but here’s something to make you happy, rhetorical <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> enjoyer. It’s a roadmap. With snow. It is a snowed-map.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First up, there’s several hotfixes culminating in Patch 1.2, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4459221603601877670?l=english">the update</a> says “implements various gameplay and interface changes,” with more details to come soon. “As you all know,” the update teastes “frostland is a dangerous place, full of hidden truths buried beneath layers of ice and time, and you are never quite certain where it may lead you and what it may uncover if you look hard enough…”</p><p>The next big’un is the “Free Major Content Update”. There aren’t any details really, although 11 bit say that “on top of DLCs, we’re committed to adding free content updates, which in many ways were inspired by your feedback, that will significantly impact your overall experience with the game.”</p>
<p>Finally, there’s three pieces of paid DLC planned: two for next year, and one for the year after. That third piece doesn’t have a name, but 2025’s DLC are named ‘Spectrum’ and ‘Aurora’. “Rest assured,” say 11 bit, “these major milestones are only part of what’s to come. Alongside them, we will continuously work on hotfixes and improvements to the game and its overall stability. Right on the horizon we have the Patch 1.2 that implements various gameplay and interface changes - more on that very soon.”</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a “an atmospheric, bold attempt to reinvent its own society-moulding subgenre,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-2-review?view=comments">reckoned Sin</a> in her review, “whose story and building features too often frustrate with too few options or distract with too many.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Popular mobile card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has warned players it will take action against anyone with a rude, inoffensive or inapproproate username.
</p>
<p>
After all, Pikachu and friends appeal to players of all ages, and the app is definitely not a place for username gags on Pokéballs.

            <p>The next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studios will be a sci-fi survival horror, in a marked change from the souslike genre.</p>
<p>As reported by Korean news site <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423">EBN</a>, the game will utilise Unreal Engine 5 and is targeting a release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The same report also confirms DLC for Lies of P is slated for the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>A statement from publisher Neowiz said it's too early to disclose progress of the project and that it is one of multiple PC and console games in development - presumably alongside the confirmed sequel to Lies of P.</p>
<p>Still, a swing to survival horror for its next standalone project is quite a change and proves the wide-reaching ambitions of the developer to become a leader in the South Korean games industry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">sequel to Lies of P was confirmed last year</a> by director Ji Won Choi. "Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel," he said at the time.</p>
<p>While it's unknown where the story will lead in a sequel, hints at the end of Lies of P have certainly had fans speculating on what fairytale could be next for the soulslike treatment, following the game's Pinocchio inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the Lies of P DLC, its existence was revealed shortly after the game's release, though so far only concept art of a ship has been shown. "I can promise you one thing," said Choi with the reveal. "What I just showed you scratches merely the tip of an iceberg."</p>
<p>Following its launch last October, Lies of P sold a million copies in less than a month and, by March of this year had surpassed seven million players (including through subscription services).</p>
<p>It's proven a big success for the developer and is now frequently considered one of the best soulslike games not created by From Software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements">Lies of P is also receiving a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 continues its solid sales performance. The game developed by Saber Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=space+marine+2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units within a day of its debut (considering pre-orders, of course) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned out</a> to be the second best-selling game launch of the year in Europe. Less than three months later, the studio <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/119-november-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Space Marine 2 broke the milestone of five million copies sold, which proves that the game was well-received among the notoriously picky Warhammer 40K fans.</p>
<p>Saber also took the opportunity to reveal to the community that Patch 5.0 would be released in the first half of December, which means in the next couple of weeks. The update will add a new PvE co-op Operation called Obelisk, in which players must rotate a replica of the Obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device. This Operation takes place in parallel to the final events of the campaign.</p>
<p>To reach the console control of the obelisk, players must venture through a dark tomb. It will be even more challenging due to a new addition to the Chaos roster: the Tzaangor Enlightened, a new Majoris enemy. They will now appear in every PvE Operation featuring Chaos.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is also getting a big customization improvement with the next update. Color lenses have finally been added, allowing players to customize between fifteen colors. Moreover, the patch will also bring the Dark Angels Chapter Pack, adding the unique armor set Dark Angels Champion as well as three themed weapons and one themed shield (for the Bulwark class).</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Patch 5.0 will introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution Frame Generation, bumping frame rates across the board on PC.</p>

<p>Saber also told fans to look forward to Titus's story continuing in Amazon's Secret Level Prime Video series, which will feature a dedicated Space Marine 2 episode. To celebrate the event, they will activate special Twitch Drops between December 10 and 31.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a> is coming in December, with the addition of a huge new island to the game. Pocketpair has also revealed a crossover collaboration with Terraria for their monster catching survival game that will arrive in 2025.</p>
<p>There’s few details to go on at this point, but the new island will be about six times the size of Sakurajima, which was added in the last major update in June. This new locale will bring “Powerful tower bosses and many vicious new species of Pals lurk here.”</p>


<p>They also promise, “A large amount of new content will also be added.”</p>

		
		

<p>Palworld launched into early access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a> at the start of this year – the console exclusivity going hand in hand with being day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> – before spreading its cute monster-y wings onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation</a> in September. The game really took the world by storm, with the “meme game” concept of being Pokémon with guns grabbing people’s attention, but then also appealing to core gamers by leaning into other popular genres like survival and base building.</p>
<p>That success, however, has brought a lot of scrutiny. Back in September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for infringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle. <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair promised to fight this lawsuit</a>, and it feels like Nintendo’s case could be a little bit shaky and tenuous… though we don’t really know how Japanese courts will view the case.</p>

<p>We’ll just have to wait and see, but even with the spectre of legal trouble in the background, it’s good to see that Pocketpair is forging ahead with big updates such as this.</p>
<p>We expect to see more news in due course, with The Game Awards a likely avenue for some kind of reveal or announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/what-we-played-death-stranding-30-birds-towers-of-aghasba/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been one of those weeks where I ignored the games I’ve been playing for a while (sorry Metaphor: ReFantazio) and started something completely different, setting out for a walk with Sam in Death Stranding. I have to say that the opening must be amongst the most cinematic game experiences I think I’ve ever had, and I absolutely love the world and the weirdness. I’m on a massive sci-fi kick at the moment too – you should all be watching Silo Season 2 on Apple TV+ – so it’s just the perfect game to match up with that.</p>

<p>In a surprise to no-one <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2 as his one chill out game, but <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/30-birds-review/">30 Birds for review</a> and it is apparently very good! He’s also started Loco Motive for review. Finally, he’s revisiting an old favourite and started replaying The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played plenty more Phasmophobia, The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a>, which is another VR game with telekinetic powers and guns, saying, “It’s great! (And on PS+ Premium game catalogue).”</p>


<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-review/">Towers of Aghasba</a> which offers some intriguing twists on the survival sandbox genre. He told us, “There’s still a lot of resource gathering, crafting, and base building, but also some cool features like nurturing emergent ecosystems and a more narrative-driven focus. It’s still in early access and I’m hoping the introduction of multiplayer will help dial up the fun factor.</p>
<p>“I’ve also been playing Assassin’s Creed Mirage which I really struggled with at first due to the rather basic combat and filler missions. Although I enjoy Basim as a protagonist, there’s only so many times Ubisoft can repeat the same assassin origin story – that said, roaming the streets of Baghdad and moving away from the RPG-ness of more recent AC games has provided a fun romp that also eschews any effort to pursue AC’s present-day storyline.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> has been getting real “Remember when Freddos were 10p?” Vibes from the Steam sale, saying. “20% off doesn’t feel like 20% off when the end result is still £40.” So he’s not actually bought anything new, but has got some bits of back catalogue in his basket. His gaming this week has been fits and starts of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, as he still hasn’t quite figured out which of the many Warhammer 40,000 games is the new one that everyone loved back in September. That and some GT7 on PS5 Pro with its shiny new ray traced reflections.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also perused the Steam sales, picking up UFO50 as an early Christmas present but just some super cheap horror stuff alongside that. Giving his new Switch a workout, Ade has been playing Bayonetta 3 and absolutely loving it. He says, “It’s a totally bonkers but totally brilliant game. It’s reminded me how much I love Platinum Games – with Vanquish being my absolute favourite – I’ve got a hankering to give Astral Chain a play next!” You’re in for a treat if you do!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

It's normally $150 but there's a 50% discount for Black Friday that drops it to only $74.99. MEGA is similar to LEGO, but the brand (which is owned by Mattel) creates sets for IPs that don't have a relationship with the other famous big block company. Some past and present examples include Pokemon, Star Trek, Halo, and, in this case, Microsoft Xbox. This would make an incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gifts-for-gamers">gift idea for any gaming fan</a> who loves working on complex building block kits like LEGO.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h2><div catalogid="71c42985-9d8c-4c5d-a28d-7485a219d539" id="211751"><div id="211751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The MEGA Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set is a buildable 3:4 scale replica of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/02/xbox-360-the-launch-review">Xbox 360 console</a> with a brick count total of 1,342 pieces (5.5 cents per brick). The details in this build are, frankly, incredible, and include interactive elements, lighting effects, and the coolest accessories. Here's a rundown of the biggest highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console exterior is well represented with details like a removable hard drive, ventilation holes in the rear, text in the right places, and lighting effects. Unfortunately, there's no option to swap in a red ring of death.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console internals are just as faithfully reproduced as the exterior. There's a tray to pop in the supplied Xbox game disc (we'll get to this later), the motherboard, various heatsinks and doodads all connected by wires, and even a fancy little Cortana chip. It's also easy to get into the console (just press a little green button).</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The set includes an authentic looking mini <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/23/halo-3-review">Halo 3</a> game disc complete with a detailed Halo game box that looks just like the real thing. That's not even the best part. You can place the Halo disc into the console's internal disc tray and it will light up the Cortana chip inside. How cool is that!?!</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox controller has a removable battery pack. When you slide in the battery pack, the controller's guide button lights up. That's because the light brick is installed in the battery itself.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">So why the big price drop? According to the user reviews, the fit and finish of the bricks is not as good as LEGO sets, so the build process won't go as smoothly (you might even need to whip out the Kragle).

<p>NDemic Creations, the developer behind the remarkably popular world-ending title, Plague Inc., has released After Inc. This mobile game follows directly on from the 2012 apocalypse-inducing epic, inviting players to build a settlement and reshape society.</p>



<p>It’s a complete flip from the first game, in which your chief goal was to rid the world of humans by creating a disease so powerful that it couldn’t be stopped. Anyone who played it knows how open-ended it was, and they also know that living in Iceland or Madagascar was usually the best way to avoid catching the nasty diseases concocted by players.</p>

<p>After Inc. is available now on iOS and Android, and it comes twelve years after the release of the first game. That’s about right in the post-apocalyptic stakes – things have to blow over before you can start rebuilding, right?</p>



<p>Per a post advertising the launch of the game, Ndemic wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After Inc. (is) a unique blend of strategic simulation, survival city builder and ‘mini 4X’. The Necroa Virus has ravaged humanity – build a settlement and shape your post-apocalyptic society.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s coming to Steam in 2025, which follows in the footsteps of Plague Inc., which launched first as a mobile exclusive game before being ported to PC. It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist now on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>At first blush, After Inc. is much more immersive and involved than Plague Inc. Players are introduced to a more detailed, granular world, and while they’re still able to influence things across a wider area, After Inc. is more focused on rebuilding the world on a localised scale than it is tearing it down on a global one.</p>



<p>To that end, After Inc. is set primarily in the United Kingdom, which is where Ndemic Creations is based.</p>



<p>In After Inc., players are invited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore ruins</li>



<li>Farm resources</li>



<li>Build and expand settlements</li>



<li>Make tough decisions</li>



<li>Extermine zombie infestations</li>



<li>Follow an intense campaign</li>
</ul>



<p>It has been a long time coming, and while most fans of Plague Inc. didn’t expect it to service, it’s a welcome addition to 2024’s gaming lineup.</p>
