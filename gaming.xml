            <p>I took a longer lunch break today, and must now Pay The Reaper by staying after work. Fortunately, I've spent my penance playing the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witching-stone">Witching Stone</a>, which applies the magic of shape-matching to the magic of, well, magic. Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that "combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.</p><!--more-->

<p>The setup: you are an anime sorceress exploring a node-based dungeon map. Some nodes harbour treasure chests, campsites and shopkeepers. Others trigger battles, which are turn-based affairs. Rather than just choosing Firaga from a menu, however, you'll need to string together the raw materials on the grid display below the warring characters.</p>
<p>Each spell needs a different mix of shapes, and while you can cast several simultaneously, you can only draw a line through a certain number of squares per turn. Firing off a spell also deletes those shapes from the grid, causing others to fall from above, so in addition to selecting the optimal wizardry, you're trying to clear away undesired shapes and set up combinations for your next turn.</p>
<p>If you've ever played the glorious Puzzle Quest games or Capcom's Puzzle Fighter series, you'll find all this very intuitive. As in Puzzle Quest, there's a progression system. In this case, it's about expanding your spellbook and modding your spells. The Giant Slayer mod, for example, makes your lightning bolt deal more damage at the expense of always targeting the beefiest opponent. Even based on the 15 minutes I've played, it feels like there's scope for some hair-raising concoctions, and what is a witch who doesn't deal in hair-raising concoctions? A sham, that's what. An embarrassment.</p>
<p>All told, this was well worth loitering after five for - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693530/Witching_Stone/">find the demo on Steam</a>. In general, I'm always in favour of video game sorcery that involves the actual assemblage of spells - it stops them feeling like guns. If you despise grid puzzles and would prefer a real-time incarnation of all this, let me join up three squiggly blue diamonds to make a Hex Of Greater Displacement and warp you in the direction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These sales are often great opportunities to buy games you might’ve missed or may never have heard of for a pretty good price. For example, there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-series-humble-bundle-sale-1851635986&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-series-humble-bundle-sale-1851635986">killer <em>Resident Evil </em>sale</a></span> bundle available right now, and you can get the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-sale-playstation-1851636254&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-sale-playstation-1851636254"><em>Hitman </em>trilogy for dirt cheap too</a></span>.</p><p>PlayStation is currently holding a sale and here’s what I think you should prioritize as you sift through those digital store shelves.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354"><em>It Takes Two </em>won Game of the Year</a></span> back in 2021, shocking a bunch of people, myself included. In retrospect, it wasn’t that much of an impossibility. <em>It Takes Two </em>is, for what it’s worth, still the very best co-op game I’ve played. So many experiences are made better by just having another person or two around, but Hazelight Games went the extra mile to make a game catered to co-op and ingenuity. Across the span of the game, you play as a miniaturized couple on the cusp of divorce who have to learn to overcome their differences in order to make it back to their normal life and daughter. The wonderfully fantastical journey they go on transforms <em>It Takes Two </em>from just another 3D platformer into <em>so </em>much else.</p><p>At one point, <em>It Takes Two </em>jokingly becomes a 2D fighting game. At another junction, it becomes a third-person shooter. At yet another, it’s a decently compelling top-down ARPG like <em>Diablo</em>. You ride frogs throughout one level, and skate across an icy landscape in another. <em>It Takes Two </em>is constantly reinventing itself over the course of a playthrough, and crafts situations that test both players in unique ways the entire time. <strong>There is not a more diverse co-op offering out there, and you can have </strong><em><strong>It Takes Two</strong></em><strong> for just $14. </strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span><em> </em>is my favorite rhythm game of the last few years. A character action game set to the pulsing beats of a rip-roaring soundtrack, <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>is already one of the greats in my eyes, which made Xbox’s closure of the studio behind it a real blow earlier this year. Fortunately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190">Tango Gameworks has been resurrected</a></span>, and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>seems like it’ll continue on after all.</p><p>That means that you all have no excuse not to pick it up, especially since it’s one of the Xbox exclusives that made the leap to other consoles. Believe me, you want to play a game where you get bonus damage by matching button presses and attacks to the metronome of the song literally playing in the main character’s heart, all while he dons a makeshift electric guitar made of metal scrap and screams about just wanting to be a rockstar. <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>is so earnest and idealistic that you can’t help but love it, and its anti-capitalist story and visuals are just the cherry on top of that sundae. <strong>You can rock out to your heart’s content in </strong><em><strong>Hi-Fi Rush </strong></em><strong>for just $18.</strong></p></div><div><p>Often, video games are a lot. They are too big, too loud, even too bright. They are certainly too long nowadays, and even a little too intense. When I need a game to shut my brain off and just blast some music (mostly Taylor Swift) I go to <em>Powerwash Simulator</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like, and evolve into the final form of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259">closeted clean freak persona</a></span>. Go around town and spray down houses, municipal buildings, and parks for money. Just turn the world off and clean. <strong><em>Powerwash Simulator </em>is the ultimate brain-pleaser and you too can get regular releases of dopamine by picking it up for $17.49.</strong></p></div><div><p>With the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-caulfield-new-game-1851528883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-caulfield-new-game-1851528883">upcoming <em>Life is Strange</em></a></span><em> </em>title bringing back the first game’s protagonist, you may as well catch up on the life and all-too strange times of Max Caulfield. Taking place in a Pacific Northwestern town called Arcadia Bay, <em>Life is Strange </em>follows Max and her best friend Chloe as they make sense of being teenagers, their own thorny relationships, and Max’s newfound ability to rewind time. Quintessential teen shit, y’know?</p><p><em>Life is Strange </em>was acclaimed at the time for its subject matter and fresh perspective, centering a queer teenage girl and her peers who dealt with depression, suicide, sexual assault, and abuse among other things. However, the series is probably most beloved for its soft, sometimes even twee, aesthetics and deliberately nostalgic vibes. Even just writing about it prompted me to queue folksy indie songs featured throughout the series. Something about it just makes me long for it to be 2015 again. It instills in me this intense desire to walk down the hallways of my old high school, be surrounded by some of those faces I haven’t seen in nearly a decade, and not have to worry about a thing beyond my grades and the girl I was crushing on. <em>Life is Strange </em>feels like simpler times, even if it isn’t and that is perhaps the series’ greatest feat. <strong>You can pick up both the remaster of the first game and its prequel, </strong><em><strong>Before the Storm</strong></em><strong>, in this collection for $20. </strong><br></p></div><div><p>Ahead of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-trailer-lilith-handsome-jack-eridian-1851627952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-trailer-lilith-handsome-jack-eridian-1851627952">eventual release of <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span>, me and my friends are diving into the entire 2K RPG series. After much deliberation, and a confusing roll of a 20-sided die, we landed on trying the fantasy-tinged spinoff <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em>. Set within a tabletop-RPG world, <em>Wonderlands </em>maintains the series’ trope of guns, more guns, and even more guns, while translating much of the writing and character abilities to fit a more magical world. As long as you’ve got a good crew with you, these games are often a breezy and joyous time. <strong>You can get the PS4 version of </strong><em><strong>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands </strong></em><strong>for $12, and the PS5 version (along with the season pass) in the </strong><em><strong>Chaotic Great </strong></em><strong>edition for $18. </strong></p></div><div><p><em>Prey </em>has, by my estimation, the best opening to a game ever. It’s been over seven years since it first released, and I’m sure many people have seen it, but even now, I hesitate to give it away. It’s just something you need to see and feel for yourself, which is true of <em>Prey </em>itself. Words have often failed me when I try to describe <em>Prey </em>and why it’s one of the greatest games of our time, with some of the best worldbuilding, characterization, and meaningful progression systems. Talos I is still one of the best settings I’ve ever explored in a game, and one of the few worlds that made poking at its edges and corners a genuine reward. The shape-shifting and psi-blasting Typhon remain some of my favorite enemies, and no matter how far along in the game I got, or how powerful I grew, I loved that I never felt safe or secure. I still consider so many of my encounters against them as a high point in first-person shooters, stealth games, and the weird nexus of those genres that immersive sims like <em>Prey </em>find themselves in. I genuinely believe that a lot of people (myself included) didn’t get <em>Prey </em>at first, or refused to, but once you dig into it, it becomes apparent that it is one of the all-timers. <strong>You should pick up </strong><em><strong>Prey </strong></em><strong>while it’s only $6.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Void Bastards </em>is a lovely little experiment of a game. In it, you get to play as a randomly generated convict sent into derelict ships possessed by all manner of aliens, robots, and subtly supernatural creatures. Sprites, as well as much of the environment, are rendered in a flat comic book style and cel-shading, but the game plays like a roguelike first-person shooter and immersive sim across a series of bite-sized levels. To further mix things up, your character is generated with randomized traits, including buffs and debuffs that can be game-changing, hilarious, or both. Some simply make you tinier, which does reduce your hitbox, but others can make you yell when you pick things up, alerting enemies, or alternatively, make you impossible to spot. It can be a bit unwieldy, but it’s always a blast and it was successful enough to merit a spiritual successor, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, which is releasing in a few weeks. <strong>Try out </strong><em><strong>Void Bastards </strong></em><strong>ahead of that release for $9.</strong></p></div><div><p>If you own a PlayStation console, I think you just owe it to yourself to experience what sometimes feels like Sony’s last really great bonafide blockbusters: the <em>Uncharted </em>series. Unfortunately, the <em>Nathan Drake Collection</em> doesn’t include every game to star the eponymous rogue, but it does boast the trio that was released on the PS3. The first game is a little wonky, seeing as how it was Naughty Dog’s first foray into a full-blown third-person shooter (relax, I love the <em>Jak </em>games but those do not count) and a debut title for the PS3, but eventually the team got <em>really </em>good at these. In fact, they immediately got much better, as <em>Uncharted 2 </em>was widely heralded as the de facto game of the year upon release in 2009. It’s wild to consider how a linear third-person shooter that you can wrap in about 10-15 hours was considered the peak of gaming when it now eschews everything that the industry currently values.</p><p><em>Uncharted </em>is just <em>Indiana Jones </em>if it were modernized and made into a game before Bethesda and MachineGames went ahead and actually did that. The series is constantly escalating the action and stakes with increasingly impressive setpieces, such as an escape from a derailed train hanging off the side of a mountain, a classic level on top of a moving train, and a gunfight in the ballroom of a capsizing cruise ship. Nathan is a hot smart mouth who gets all the girls, and even has a rotating series of trusty sidekicks/allies. His adventures take him all over the world in the pursuit of treasure, and every now and then he even uncovers places and people of legend. <strong>It’s a good time, and you can get the </strong><em><strong>Nathan Drake Collection </strong></em><strong>for just $10.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Tetris </em>has always been able to make players feel something. Whether that’s despair at a loss, or overwhelming joy at a triumph, it has always been able to elicit a feeling. I stress this because <em>Tetris Effect </em>is often burdened with this perception that its combination of lush visuals, emotive music, and satisfying gameplay finally transformed <em>Tetris </em>into some higher form of art. I disagree: <em>Tetris </em>has always been this piercing, <em>Tetris Effect </em>just decided to make it plain as day.<br></p><p>What can be said about <em>Tetris Effect </em>and the rest of the series that hasn’t already been said somewhere else by someone with a bigger and better brain than me. It is the latest incarnation of <em>the </em>video game. Not the first one, but the one that outlined the form long before I was ever even a twinkle in my father’s eye. Before we discoursed ad nauseam about artfulness in games, <em>Tetris </em>was a living, breathing, reactive, and most importantly, challenging mosaic.<br></p><p><em>Tetris Effect Connected</em>, which adopts the last bit of its title from a song featured in the game, brings further multiplayer capabilities to the title. Like all great art, <em>Tetris Effect Connected </em>is wonderful and edifying to share with others, be they strangers or your closest friends. We’re all connected after all. You can (and should) snag <em>Tetris Effect Connected </em>on PlayStation. <strong>The PS4 version, which lacks PSVR2 support, will run you $20, while the PS5 version that does costs $30. </strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They want quirky characters, likable protagonists, heart-wrenching romances, and thrilling storylines. Thankfully, September offers a bit of everything.</p><p>From <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> and <em>Megalopolis</em> to<em> Agatha All Along </em>and<em> The Penguin</em>, we’ve got a strong month ahead of us with some big and small screen stories to nerd out over. Read on to see which movies and TV shows you should be watching this September.</p></div></div><div><p>Michael Keaton returns to the iconic role of <em>Beetlejuice</em> in a sequel many didn’t believe would or could happen so long after the first film’s release. On September 6, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> graces screens worldwide, with Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega, Monica Belluci, and Willem Dafoe starring alongside Keaton in a bonkers combination of comedy and horror. The sequel takes place 36 years after <em>Beetlejuice</em>, with the Deetz family once more turning to Winter River and reopening the Afterlife, releasing Beetlejuice upon the world.</p></div><div><p>In his most recent roles, James McAvoy has cemented himself as a fantastic and eerie antagonist with a penchant for psychotic mayhem at the drop of a hat. In <em>Speak No Evil</em>, which hits theaters on September 13, McAvoy, starring as “Paddy” alongside Mackenzie Davis’ “Louise” and Scoot McNairy’s “Ben,” heads to the countryside for an idyllic vacation that turns sour. The psychological horror movie promises plenty of twists and turns as the perfect vacation spot becomes a nightmare for everyone involved.</p></div><div><p>With a plot line that’s become more prevalent in recent years, <em>Subservience</em> tells the story of an AI that becomes self-aware and extremely deadly to the humans around her. On September 13, Megan Fox, starring opposite Michele Morrone, stars as a rogue AI designed to make family life easier but inevitably forces everyone within her reach into a frantic, adrenaline-pumping race for survival.</p></div><div><p>From the team behind <em>WandaVision</em>, Marvel Television returns with another series about a spell-casting witch wielding unimaginable powers in the form of <em>Agatha All Along</em>. Kathryn Hahn, known for <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, and <em>Bad Moms</em>, stars alongside Aubrey Plaza and Paul Adelstein on a fantastic journey full of supernatural action, adventure, and appropriate touches of comedy. <em>Agatha All Along</em> tells the story of a powerful woman who gains her freedom and embarks on a journey to reclaim her abilities on the Witches’ Road, and you can watch it all unfold on September 18.</p></div><div><p>Starring Colin Farrell in the titular role, <em>The Penguin</em> follows the iconic villain from DC Comics’ Batman franchise. Premiering September 19, the limited series follows The Penguin’s rise to power as he attempts to take control of Gotham City from its underbelly. The series features eight episodes, with the finale concluding the tale on November 10. The saga continues Penguin’s storyline from <em>The Batman</em> (2022), giving fans greater insight into the villain’s rise.</p></div><div><p><em>Transformers One</em> returns to the franchise’s roots as an animated film based on the toy line instead of the live-action series many associate it with. On September 20, <em>Transformers One</em>, starring Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, and others hits theaters across the U.S. The animated film follows Optimus Prime and Megatron in a first-of-its-kind origin story set on Cybertron, depicting how the two became archenemies.</p></div><div><p>It’s an excellent month for those who enjoy horror, with <em>The Substance</em> covering the body horror sub-genre on September 20. Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid star in this upcoming flick that premiered at the 77th Cannes Film Festival. At the core of its premise, once injected, a miracle drug creates a better version of the user. The results turn horrific as the two versions fight over control, tearing apart the one body they share.</p></div><div><p>Francis Ford Coppola, the iconic director known for such films as <em>The Godfather </em>and <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, gathers an ensemble cast in <em>Megalopolis</em>—an epic science-fiction drama starring Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, Laurence Fishburne, and many other high-profile stars. Releasing theatrically on September 27, <em>Megalopolis</em> tells the story of New Rome, where an architect can control time and rebuild the city into a utopia following a disaster of immense proportions.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wild Robot</em>, the month’s second high-profile animated film following <em>Transformers One</em>, releases in theaters on September 27. Starring Lupita Nyong’o (<em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>) and Pedro Pascal (<em>The Last of Us</em>), the film follows along the book series of the same name and features a robot named “Roz,” who is shipwrecked on an island and must learn to survive by building relationships with the animals living there. DreamWorks may have a winner on its hands that both children and adult fans of animation will love.</p></div><div><p>When it launched in 2010, <em>The Walking Dead</em> became a cultural phenomenon. Over a decade later, the television series has branched into numerous spinoffs focusing on specific characters. Perhaps the most iconic of these characters is none other than Daryl Dixon, the gruff zombie-slayer played by Norman Reedus since day one. The spinoff in question, <em>The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon</em>, which returns for its second season on September 29, is dubbed <em>The Book of Carol</em> but follows the titular character in France as he struggles to comprehend how he wound up in Europe and how he can return home.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Xur's back for another weekend of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, and with Act 3 of Episode: Echoes in full swing, you can never go wrong with a visit to the arms dealer. As usual, you can pick up some fresh rolls of Exotic gear--one of these might pair nicely with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-chorus-of-one-guide-god-rolls-and-how-to-get-the-exotic-auto-rifle/1100-6526143/" data-ref-id="1100-6526143">new Exotic weapon Choir of One</a>--Legendary-class armor, and some useful items to farm for Strange Coins for when Exotic class items are offered again. Here's where Xur is this week, and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for <strong>Huckleberry</strong> and <strong>Trinity Ghoul</strong>, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up <strong>Celestial Nighthawk</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Severance Enclosure</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Crown of Tempests</strong>. If you're looking for Exotic weapons, Xur has <strong>Hawkmoon</strong>, <strong>Arbalest</strong>, <strong>Hard Light</strong> , and <strong>The Prospector</strong> this week. Xur is also offering <strong>Exotic Class Items</strong> again this week.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359590-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359590" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359590-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359590"></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the Tower's Bazaar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359590-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

Xur won't have Exotic class items every week, so you'll want to farm for Strange Coins to have enough to buy multiple rolls.</p><h3>Celestial Nighthawk (Exotic Hunter helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359699-destiny22024-08-3019-07-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359699-destiny22024-08-3019-07-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359699"></a><figcaption>Celestial Nighthawk</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359699-destiny22024-08-3019-07-54.jpg"></figure><p>A classic from Destiny 2's first year, Celestial Nighthawk lets you fire one single high-damage shot from the Golden Gun Super instead of three. You can reduce the cooldown of your Super pretty quickly with this Exotic, and it works very nicely with the Still Hunt Exotic sniper rifle, even after a recent nerf. The stats on this helmet are weird, as it has low resilience, strength, and discipline, while recovery is almost maxed out. Intellect is also high, so if you're going all in on the Super-centric nature of this helmet, it could be a good one to grab this week.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 3</li><li>Resilience: 7</li><li>Recovery: 25</li><li>Discipline: 8</li><li>Intellect: 19</li><li>Strength: 2</li><li>Total: 64</li></ul><h3>Severance Enclosure (Exotic Titan chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359700-destiny22024-08-3019-08-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359700-destiny22024-08-3019-08-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359700"></a><figcaption>Severance Enclosure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359700-destiny22024-08-3019-08-03.jpg"></figure><p>Like the best Titan Exotics, Severance Enclosure enhances your punching ability with some explosive firepower. As long as you have a charged melee, you can detonate your fist against anything that gets in your way. Strength and discipline are pretty good on this roll, recovery is average, and resilience could be better as mobility is unnecessarily high on this Exotic. It's not an entirely bad version of the chest armor, and because Xur seldom stocks it, it's worth grabbing now as it still has plenty of potential.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 14</li><li>Resilience: 6</li><li>Recovery: 12</li><li>Discipline: 19</li><li>Intellect: 2</li><li>Strength: 12</li><li>Total: 65</li></ul><h3>Crown of Tempests (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359701-destiny22024-08-3019-08-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359701" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359701-destiny22024-08-3019-08-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4359701"></a><figcaption>Crown of Tempests</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4359701-destiny22024-08-3019-08-10.jpg"></figure><p>Sure, it's one of the ugliest Exotics in Destiny, but Crown of Tempests makes up for it by being brilliant to equip when you're using an Arc subclass, as it enhances the duration of the Stormtrance Super and increases the recharging rate of your Arc abilities when you apply ability or jolt effects to enemies. It also works very well with getting your Super recharged quickly when using the Prismatic subclass, so it's worth being a walking fashion disaster when wearing this. For the stats, they're a bit all over the place, but the good news is that you're getting high resilience and strength. Recovery will need to be buffed and discipline is average, as mobility chews up some points from those categories.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 17</li><li>Resilience: 16</li><li>Recovery: 3</li><li>Discipline: 10</li><li>Intellect: 6</li><li>Strength: 15</li><li>Total: 67</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Exotic Weapon Catalysts</h2><h3>Huckleberry (Exotic submachine gun)</h3><p>Kills with this

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

Games has announced the closure of mobile game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-magic-awakened">Harry Potter: Magic Awakened</a> just over a year after its global launch.</p><p>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, a collectible card role-playing game developed by Zen Studio, launched in the west in June 2023 courtesy of Warner Bros. Games’ Portkey Games publishing label. In the game you play as a new student at Hogwarts and collect cards you deploy as spells in duels.</p><p>Harry Potter: Magic Awakened was removed from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store on August 26, with servers running until October 29, 2024. It is now no no longer possible to make in-game purchases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Its Asian release was handled by Chinese games company NetEase, currently in the headlines <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-dev-reportedly-being-shut-down-by-netease">for reportedly shutting down the Visions of Mana developer, Ouka Studios</a>. Despite its shutdown in the west, Harry Potter: Magic Awakened will remain available to play in Asia.</p><p>“We have shared the magical journey of Harry Potter: Magic Awakened with millions of fans around the globe,” Warner Bros. said in a statement published to its <a href="https://portkeygamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/32591302636819-Harry-Potter-Magic-Awakened-Officially-Closing-in-the-Americas-Europe-and-Oceania-territories-on-October-29-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support website</a>.</p><p>“The time has come for Harry Potter: Magic Awakened to officially close its servers in the Americas, Europe and Oceania territories on October 29, 2024.

Warner Bros. ruled out server transfers and refunds in an FAQ, and declined to comment when contacted by IGN on the possibility of NetEase taking on the game in the west.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the closure of Harry Potter: Magic Awakened comes ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a>, a new game based on the fictional sport.

The full patch notes are available below.</p><p>College Football 25 arrived July 16 as the highly anticipated return of the beloved sports series. It became a smash hit, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-is-off-to-a-strong-start-ahead-of-its-official-release">pulling in as many as 700,000 players in its first day of early access</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/22-million-people-were-willing-to-pay-100-to-play-college-football-25-3-days-early">a staggering 2.2 million by the end</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">In our 7/10 review</a>, IGN said: "College Football 25 nails the on-field action with a dynamic feel, stellar graphics, and tons of smart gameplay tweaks. However, so much of what's off the field feels unfinished, with UI issues and barebones modes that seem like they are waiting for a rebuild next season."</p><h2>College Football 25 Title Update August 29, 2024 Patch Notes</h2><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Switch Stick Delay option is available.

These changes, according to Valve, were made based on explicit feedback provided by developers, some during Gamescom earlier in August.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both changes give studios control of what related items appear on a title's store page.

However, Valve stressed a developer (or publisher, or franchise) must have a specific page set up first before this can be set.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After related titles are locked in, studios can choose the listing order (top-seller, price, relevance, etc.), or manually override sort order and move specific games around in the set. Manually placed games will show up before others.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second change lets developers highlight one DLC item "in a bigger way." With this, a game's newest (or most-known) DLC release can now be pinned, or an upcoming post-launch item (like an expansion) to draw players' attention to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to the related tab for full games, developers just have to go to the Store Editor's "special settings" tab and select "DLC."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are pre-selected reasons to choose from, such as "new" or "upcoming" DLC.

So it’s no surprise that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>—the very first open-world Star Wars title (no, MMOs don’t count)—is an extremely long game filled with tons to see and do. That goes doubly for anyone looking to finish absolutely everything in the game and earn all of the trophies and achievements. Let’s take a look at how long it takes to beat <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> based on how much you’d like to complete.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Star Wars Outlaws Lost Me With Its Story Trailer" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="138" data-playlist="196842,195326,196181" data-current="196842"><div><p>Star Wars Outlaws Lost Me With Its Story Trailer</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196842/196842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22392.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h10500"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>?</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking to breeze through the main campaign of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> without engaging with much of its extra content, you can reach the credits in only <strong>15-20 hours</strong>.

Take your time.</p><h3 id="h10501"><a id=""></a><strong>What does it take to 100% <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>?</strong></h3><p>Indeed, this open-world adventure is massive and densely populated with NPCs to meet, treasures to find, lore to uncover, and secrets to unveil.

You’ll have to reach maximum reputation with every faction at least once, finish every Expert quest, discover every planet area, find all Nix Treasures, and complete 40 contracts. You’ll also need to complete a wide variety of miscellaneous activities, like getting a high score in an arcade game, doing specific actions in combat a certain number of times, and spending a fair amount of time gambling.</p><p>Engaging with just <em>some</em> of this can add a dozen hours on top of the already lengthy campaign, but you can expect full completion of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to take you up to <strong>40 hours</strong>.

Alongside this new expansion, Blizzard is planning to release the 2.0 update for<em> Diablo 4</em>. To help test this update before it goes live, Blizzard announced a test period for PC players that will happen between September 4-11. And based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24130178/the-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24130178/the-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new in-depth blog post</a></span> from Blizzard, this new 2.0 update is a big ‘un.</p><h2 id="h11879"><a id=""></a>New, lower level cap and difficulty changes</h2><p>Perhaps the biggest news is that <em>Diablo 4</em>'s level cap is being lowered from 100 to 60. If you are worried that this means leveling up will be slowed down, Blizzard says that’s not the case. Instead, the studio explained that as it expanded <em>Diablo 4</em>'s endgame, it wants more players to get there quicker. It also helps squish stats and damage numbers, too, which were apparently getting out of hand. </p><p>Once players hit level 60, they’ll start earning Paragon levels, which can be used to unlock nodes and improve all your characters, as the Paragon system will now be realm-based, not character-based. If you have any characters above level 50, all their existing XP-based Paragon Points will be converted into Paragon Levels. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-free-trial-sale-steam-deck-pc-vessel-hatred-1851630535"><em>Diablo 4</em></a></span><em> </em>is also ditching its world tier difficulty system and replacing it with Torment levels, making it more similar to how <em>Diablo 3 </em>worked. (A lot of these changes feel heavily inspired by <em>Diablo 3,</em> actually...) </p><p>Now difficulty will be split between two options: Standard and Torment. Standard is how you’ll start the game and how you’ll level up to 60. You can choose between Normal, Hard, Expert, and Penitent. </p><p>Once you hit max level and enter the endgame, you’ll begin to work through Torment levels, which start at one and max out at four. These Torment levels will be very challenging, warns Blizzard, and you’ll have your stats nerfed as you move through the levels. Here’s what that looks like: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Torment 1: -250 Armor and -25% All Resist</li><li>Torment 2: -500 Armor and -50% All Resist</li><li>Torment 3: -750 Armor and -75% All Resist</li><li>Torment 4: -1000 Armor and -100% All Resist</li></ul><p>To unlock Torment 1 you have to reach level 60. That also unlocks the Pit, an endgame activity. Reach level 20 of that Pit and you’ll unlock Torment 1. From there, you have to dig into the Pit and keep beating higher tiers to unlock the later Torment levels. This won’t be easy. </p><p>A smaller change that I’m excited about is that in the 2.0 update, monsters and demons will no longer have their level displayed in-game. Instead, they’ll scale to your difficulty, not your level. Blizzard says this change is being implemented based on feedback from players that they felt weak.</p><p>Blizzard also confirmed that all classes are getting one new ability each and five new passives. And passives in each class’s skill tree now have more connections, so you’ll have more flexibility when leveling up and creating your perfect warrior.</p><p>Keep in mind that these changes could, well, change between now and October as players test out the update via the Private Test Realm. But the overall takeaway seems to be that in<em> Vessel of Hatred </em>and <em>Diablo 4</em> 2.0, Blizzard wants more people playing the endgame and wants people to have more options and flexibility in creating characters and builds. </p><hr><p>Here are the full patch notes:<br></p><h2 id="h11880"><a id=""></a>All Classes</h2><p><strong><em>Mythic Unique Items</em></strong></p><p>Heir of Perdition - Mythic Unique Helm</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>AffixesInherent: +200% Damage to Angels and Demons+20% Critical Strike Chance+20% Lucky Hit Chance+20% Movement Speed+2 to Core Skills</li><li>PowerSuccumb to hatred and earn Mother’s Favor, increasing your damage dealt by 60%[x].

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/milepost-zero-update-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Strap in and get your connections ready, Fallout 76 fans. Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that to apply the Milepost Zero update that’s being released in Fallout 76 next week, users will need to redownload <strong>their entire game</strong>. </p>



<p>It was explained that this is due to a ‘repackaging effort’ that’ll ultimately make the game’s install size much smaller, but it’s not good news for those with a weak internet connection.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-update">Major Update</h2>



<p>Milepost Zero is the next super-sized Fallout 76 update, bringing new repeatable events, changes to the C.A.M.P. mechanics, and various tweaks and alterations to existing events, quests, and weapons. </p>



<p>However, to install the update, you’ll be forced to redownload your entire game – regardless of the platform that you play Fallout 76 on.</p>



<p>When asked on Twitter if users will need to ‘uninstall and reinstall the game’, Bethesda’s support function simply replied, ‘Yes.’</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ℹ️ On Tuesday, September 3 at 10 AM ET/9 AM CT, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fallout</a> 76 will be going offline to apply the Milepost Zero update!  </p><p>This update will require a full redownload of the entire game due to a repackaging effort which will make the overall game size smaller. <a href="https://t.co/HIpBvmEwJB">pic.twitter.com/HIpBvmEwJB</a></p></div>— Bethesda Support (@BethesdaSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1829519449583394940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>One of the chief concerns amongst the community is whether this will wipe in-game photo galleries, some of which have been built up over a series of years by users dedicated to the game. Presently, we’re not sure if that’s the case, but I’ve reached out to Bethesda to get the full scope of that potential issue.</p>



<p>This is a welcome change in some respects, as Fallout 76 has long been a dramatically bloated title. Presently, it sits at more than 110 GB on some platforms, almost four times the size of the base installation of Fallout 4 on PC.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Milepost Zero when it’s released?</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/game-review-peggle-pc/"><em>Peggle</em></a>? If you were lucky enough to play this deceptively deep <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2065.html">pachinko</a>-meets-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagatelle">bagatelle</a> game in the late '00s, you know how addictive and entrancing it could be to just watch a bouncing ball ricochet off brightly colored pegs.
</p><p>While developer Popcap <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/03/peggle-has-been-quite-the/">released</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/xbox-one-game-extravaganza-hands-on-with-10-launch-exclusives/2/">few sequels</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/09/peggle-nights-is-here-look-upon-your-productivity-and-despair/">spinoffs</a> in the years after <em>Peggle</em>'s 2007 release, the series has largely languished since <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/us-electronicarts-idUSTRE76B7FK20110713/">Popcap's acquisition by EA in 2011</a>. Today, the only actively supported version of the game is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peggle-blast/id853834250"><em>Peggle Blast</em></a>, a smartphone port that dumbs down the gameplay with frequent pushes to spend real money on needed items, à la <em>Candy Crush</em> and its ilk.
</p><p>A few other games have tried to capture the old <em>Peggle</em> ball-bouncing magic in the last decade, most notably <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/848030/Roundguard/">the excellent but sometimes overwhelming <em>Roundguard</em></a>. But <em>Peglin</em>—which launched out of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296610/Peglin/">an extended Steam early access period</a> and also <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/peglin-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqrm_uNO4pRmufl3mEKOvoXiOJWgk4QF-Niuyh-QkGbwmwTKKB3">saw a Nintendo Switch release</a> this week—is my new favorite take on the concept, combining <em>Peggle's </em>addictive ball-bouncing with just the right mix of roguelike randomization and RPG-style progression.</p>
<h2>Take your shot</h2>
<p>Every shot in <em>Peglin</em> is akin to a turn in an old-school RPG. Each peg your bouncing ball hits before falling out the bottom of the board contributes a bit to your attack power against a horde of enemies that slowly march toward you in a cute animated strip above.</p>

                    There's some real artistry in some pegboard layouts.                  </p>

<p>Not all pegs are created equal, though. Each board has two bright yellow "critical" pegs that crank up the attack value of each hit, moving randomly around the board between shots. Green "refresh" pegs are also needed to replace pegs that have disappeared after earlier hits and can lead to some extreme chains when hit at just the right point in a shot. Then there are the bombs, which send your ball flying after being lit and hit while also representing a powerful attack that hits all enemies.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The balls you fire aren't all created equal, either. There are balls with extreme critical damage, balls that can impart harmful status effect on enemies, and balls that can coat pegs with helpful slime. There are balls that can heal your and balls that activate nearby pegs with each hit. Some balls are extra bouncy, others get attracted to each peg with a weak magnetic force, and still others get split into multiball patterns after being shot.&nbsp;You get the idea.</p>
<p>Building and upgrading a tailored bag of these varied and helpful balls—using coins collected from special pegs on each stage—is one of the most satisfying parts of a <em>Peglin</em> run. But those same coins are the best way of healing in between fights, so you have to manage your resources carefully. Runs can also be enhanced by a wide variety of powerful relics that give permanent stat bonuses or shot effects, though often with a downside that might outweigh the benefits if you're not careful.</p>
<p>Each <em>Peglin</em> run progresses through a randomized <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style map, which lets you avoid a lot of battles if you're careful. Amid the usual shops and treasures, you'll also stumble on quite a few random encounters that let you make simple decisions like trading health for upgrades or risking existing balls for new, more powerful ones.</p>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will only support NVIDIA DLSS 2 and AMD FSR 2 at launch, as support for the more recent versions of both upscalers will only come after release.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update">August Community Update post</a>, Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive provided some new information on their game launching next month on PC and consoles, confirming that NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 support will only come after launch. Ray tracing and HDR will also not be supported, while ultrawide support is planned, but will only come after launch, possibly by the end of September. Steam Deck support is also planned to arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will also feature multiple display modes on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Quality mode will provide 4K resolution, 30 FPS gameplay on PS5 and Xbox Series X but only 1440p resolution on Xbox Series S, while Performance mode will offer up to 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution. Speaking about crossplay, it has been confirmed that it will be available from day one on PC and consoles, but the PvP Eternal War mode will have separate lobbies, so crossplay will only be available with friends.</p>
<p>The game's launch on September 9th will only be the beginning, as Saber Interactive plans to support the game with new content and features. As part of Season 1, the game will get the aforementioned ultrawide support, as well as Private PvE lobbies and a Sparring Arena. More content will be coming during Season 2 this October, as well as in Seasons 3 and 4, which will conclude the<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/"> first year of post-launch support.</a></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 releases on September 9th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

A game developer, Alderon Games, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/dev-reports-that-intels-laptop-cpus-are-also-crashing-several-laptops-have-suffered-similar-crashes-in-testing">had raised concerns that laptop chips <em>were</em> affected</a> last month.</p><p>Additionally, Intel is saying today that many desktop chips aren’t affected by the specific voltage issue, either: 13th and 14th Gen i5 chips that aren’t part of the K-series, i3 chips, and Xeon chips aren’t affected, it claims. </p><p>Here’s more info direct from Intel:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Unaffected Products List</strong></p><p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Additional-Warranty-Updates-on-Intel-Core-13th-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1621987#M75987">recent warranty extension</a>&nbsp;announcement for affected Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors, Intel confirms these currently available processors are&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>affected by the Vmin Shift Instability issue:</p><p>12th Gen Intel Core desktop and mobile processors</p><p>Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen i5 (non-K) &amp; i3 desktop processors</p><p>Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen mobile processors – including HX-series processors.</p><p>Intel Xeon processors – including server and workstation processors.</p><p>Intel Core Ultra (Series 1) processors</p><p><strong>Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen Desktop Processor BIOS Updates</strong></p><p>While most Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors are not impacted by the Vmin Shift Instability issue, Intel recommends all users continue following guidance:</p><p>Ensure the system is running with the latest BIOS, which users can look up through&nbsp;<a href="https://compatibleproducts.intel.com/">Intel’s Compatibility Tool</a>&nbsp;and/or their motherboard manufacturer’s website. Users can also learn more about how to update their BIOS by visiting the following site:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/how-to-update-bios.html">How to Update BIOS</a>.</p><p>Utilizing the Intel Default Settings recommendations for their Intel Core 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processor – including both Intel Core 13th and 14th Gen consumer, commercial, and entry workstation desktop systems.</p></blockquote></div><p>Intel also reiterated today that its future chips, including those coming this fall on the new Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake architectures, won’t be affected by the Vmin Shift Instability issue. “Intel will ensure future product families are protected against the Vmin Shift Instability issue as well.”</p><p>At this point, every motherboard maker <em>should</em> have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216129/should-we-do-a-big-screaming-headline-about-intel-bios-updates">BIOS updates out</a> that can reduce the potential for your i9, i7, or K-series i5 desktop CPU to be permanently damaged.

Then these people find a new reason to harass developers who made a game they weren’t the target audience for. The goalpost moves once again.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
