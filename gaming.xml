                <p>The Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and his fellow CDPR veterans at Rebel Wolves have shared an extended gameplay demo from the studio's first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-blood-of-dawnwalker/" data-ref-id="5000-647970">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. As revealed earlier this year, Dawnwalker's protagonist is Coen, a young man in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-look-at-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-reveals-a-medieval-world-ruled-by-vampires/1100-6528789/" data-ref-id="1100-6528789">a medieval European country that has been taken over by vampires</a>. But as seen in the video below, Coen has different ways of opposing the new regime, both as a vampire and as a human.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro8psdfcxJE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ro8psdfcxJE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to design director Daniel Sadowski, the side mission showcased in this demo takes place near the middle of the game. Coen only has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-directors-vampire-game-might-be-a-literal-time-suck/1100-6529556/" data-ref-id="1100-6529556">30 days and 30 nights</a> to save his family, and Sadowski notes that he could storm the vampire's castle and rescue them at any time. But without allies or enough power to stand against the game's most powerful vampires, that attempt probably wouldn't end well for Coen.</p><p>Coen isn't helpless during the day, as the demo shows he can draw upon some magic when fighting his foes. But none of his vampire abilities can be used while the sun is up. This allows for some advantages, as he can walk through the front door of the cathedral uncontested and ask questions inside. But waiting until nightfall gives Coen the ability to climb the walls and sneak inside just as an elder vampire, Xanthe, is conducting some kind of ritual.</p><p>Sadowski added that there's not much difference between the side quests and the main story, as players are given the chance to shape their own narratives within the 30 day timeframe. He also added that it may be possible to reason with Xanthe or even to defeat her. But she proves to be more than Coen can handle on this playthrough.</p><p>Bandai Namco will release The Blood of Dawnwalker on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <p>Actor Charlie Cox may be known to many in these parts for voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, but even though the game has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud".</p>
<p>Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent.</p>

<p>In a clip which has been circulated around social media, Cox revealed he is "not a gamer", and while he doesn't want to minimise Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in any way, he hasn't actually played it himself.</p>
<p>"Apparenly the game is awesome," Cox said in the clip, which was filmed during Washington State Summer Con 2025. The actor, who currently portrays Matt Murdoch/Daredevil in the Marvel universe, added he is "thrilled" for developer Sandfall Interactive, and the success its game has had.</p>
<p>"People keep saying how amazing it is," Cox said. All in all, it's a pretty wholesome little video. You can check out Cox's full comment via the embed below (I am afraid it is an X post).</p> <div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review.1225593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach unfolds with deliberate, slow grace. The opening moments depict Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) and his adoptive daughter, Lou, embarking on a reflective journey home, navigating a breathtakingly photorealistic landscape bathed in the golden hues of a setting sun. A gentle, melancholic song by Woodkid drifts across the scenery, perfectly underscoring the serenity of the moment as Sam engages in endearing conversation with Lou, her delighted giggles echoing across the landscape.</p>
<p>As the pair advances, the weather takes a turn for the worse, the scorching sunlight giving way to a deluge of rain that lashes down. Rivulets of water weave through jagged rock formations, and slick mud clings to Sam’s legs. The meticulous environmental detail is so exquisitely rendered that I half expected David Attenborough to start narrating, extolling the majesty of this digital wilderness. The cinematography in this game is superb – so good that I’ve taken hundreds of pictures during my playthrough, and I don’t usually use an in-game photo mode.</p>

<p>The introduction leads into a visit by the enigmatic Fragile (Léa Seydoux), who chain-smokes Gauloises with theatrical fervour to remind us she’s<em> really, really</em>, French. Their exchange sets in motion Sam’s next objective: a mission to Mexico, the border of which is conveniently located a short stroll away. Once again, Sam must undertake the Herculean task of reconnecting isolated Mexican settlements to the Chiral Network (WiFi that uses the land of the dead rather than cables – just go with it), mirroring the sprawling odyssey across the continental United States that defined the first instalment.</p>
<p>Mexico functions primarily as a four-hour introduction, essentially a prologue that doubles as a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the mechanics of the original game. It meticulously walks players through the fundamentals of arranging cargo, constructing roads, and evaluating terrain — every single aspect that returning players already mastered in the first instalment is re-explained through methodical missions. While there are nominal additions, the most conspicuous change is that Sam now carries a child, thereby losing his ability to detect Beached Things (BTs) at a distance. In addition – prepare yourselves for this groundbreaking revelation — an experience points system has been added, offering marginal enhancements.</p>

<p>At this point, I began to grow concerned for what was to come. While there are a few moments of Kojima’s typical absurdity, there is also an awful lot of repetition from the first game, and while that is not a bad thing – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">I did give that game 10/10</a>, after all – it did leave me feeling disappointed.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460873">The Plate Gate that allows travel between Mexico and Australia.</p>
<p>The repetition is most obvious in the graphics and audio, which remain largely indistinguishable from its predecessor. The models and animations have undergone little to no evolution, the sound effects are recycled, and Mexico and every other region you traverse bears a striking uniformity. Deserts, forests, grasslands, and snowy peaks are all represented, yet they are so generically rendered that, without a label on a map, it would be impossible to say if you are walking to Mexico City, Melbourne, or Manchester. A core appeal of post-apocalyptic settings lies in the thrill of uncovering iconic landmarks in ruin – tangible remnants of a once-familiar world. As some pre-Death Stranding architecture remains intact within the game it would have helped to include the decimated husk of the Sydney Opera House in a distant corner of the map, simply to provide a geographic anchor.</p>
<p data-start="80" data-end="864">The majority of its innovations are, in essence, minor refinements of mechanics already present in the original game. Take, for instance, the Cargo Cannons. They return from the original, but can now fire grenades so you can use them as improvised weaponry. While mildly amusing, this is hardly the kind of inventive thinking one has come to expect from a Kojima production.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460874">Tar Man meets the utterly adorable Tar Kitty.</p>
<p>Even mission design suffers from repetition. The ridiculous timed pizza delivery returns, complete with identical constraints: keep the box perfectly level and arrive within a strict time limit. Was there truly no time over five years to reimagine this task with something more novel? A precariously stacked tower of gourmet burgers, perhaps, or a box of delicately fragranced chicken wings susceptible to jostling? Instead, we are given a recycled objective that reinforces the feeling that this sequel is struggling to forge a distinct identity beyond that of its predecessor.</p>
<p>What I’m playing is a retread of the same surreal Kojima flourishes: infants sealed in artificial wombs, viscous tar-like apparitions, spectral entities lurking in the mist. All were new and exciting in the first game, but now they barely register a reaction. From a world-building perspective, the stagnation is at least narratively justified—the sequel unfolds a mere nine months after the events of Death Stranding<i>—</i>but from a creative standpoint the experience feels, and I can scarcely believe I’m applying this word to a Kojima production, indolent.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460875">The team discuss their next move.</p>
<p>The entire Mexico segment is narratively dispensable, save for a fleeting appearance by Higgs (Troy Baker), and once a pivotal moment takes Sam toward Australia, the game reverts to the precise framework of Death Stranding. Once again, Sam is equipped with a Bridge Baby (BB) contained in a pod and once again, the player is tasked with methodical traversal, network reconnection, and infrastructural expansion. It’s not until ten hours in that the actual narrative begins to emerge with the introduction of Tomorrow (Elle Fanning) and Neil (Luca Marinelli), the latter assuming a role strikingly similar to that of Mads Mikkelsen in the first game: a morally ambiguous figure trapped in a Chiral purgatory, this time resembling a nightmare version of Mexico, who pursues Sam with a battalion of spectral soldiers. Soon after, we meet Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna), and if you fail to deduce her abilities just before embarking on a mission involving a forest fire, congratulations, the ensuing reveal may still surprise you. The rest of us are unlikely to be so fortunate.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460871">Sam goes surfing on a coffin.</p>
<p>While there’s so much familiarity, your gradual expansion of the Chiral Network and infrastructure is still strangely satisfying,&nbsp;and before long I found myself engaging in side missions and obsessively completing every stretch of road. Alongside all the returning tools from DS1 is the DHV Magellan, a tar-based craft that appears near settlements once they are brought online. This mobile base allows for instantaneous transport between regions, including all stored cargo and even vehicles. Instead of laboriously driving across terrain, I could load up a truck with materials, drive it into the DHV Magellan, and teleport across the map in moments, although the game does disable this mode of transport at key points so you do have to do some of the hard work. Another substantial addition is the monorail system: construct the full line, and you and an impressive amount of cargo can go soaring above hostile landscapes with ease.</p>
<p>Your progress is still bound to the same upgrades as found in DS1, even if that makes little sense when Australia is meant to exist within the same Chiral Network as the US – surely Sam should be able to fabricate everything already? A few additions stand out though, such as the introduction of teleportation devices and, most delightfully, a high-velocity Coffin Surfboard. Yes, a coffin that doubles as a surfboard, capable of gliding at great speed across any terrain including water, snow and tar. During combat, you can even leap inside and momentarily escape into the realm of the dead.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460876">Neil, his soldiers, and an awful lot of fireworks. You have to see this in motion it is spectacular!</p>
<p>The asynchronous multiplayer connectivity found in Death Stranding returns in its sequel, allowing players to once again encounter structures, signs, and vehicles left behind by others as they traverse the world. This seems to be have been significantly amplified with overly generous results. Strategic mission planning becomes redundant when ladders, ropes, and other structures appear with uncanny precision wherever you might require them. I quickly abandoned the effort of carefully equipping myself, knowing that, inevitably, another player would have placed the precise tool or building I needed at the optimal location. There is an option to limit the amount of help you receive, so I suggest you turn that on from the start.</p>
<p>Combat encounters remain a highlight and raiding human encampments provide thrills and spectacle. The gunplay feels substantial and tactile—evocative of Killzone in its weight—and the enemy AI behaves with satisfying realism. Higgs’ robotic legions are deployed sparingly, but when they do appear the mix of humanoid and bestial adversaries brings a welcome unpredictability to encounters. These animalistic foes pounce from afar or dart past you with sudden ferocity making them a very different enemies from the humanoids.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460877">Is this Mexico, the USA, Australia, or Croydon? Who can tell.</p>
<p>There are hints at new gameplay mechanics, though they often falter in execution. One mission tasked me with recapturing an escaped kangaroo for Cvrches, the real-world pop group who make a suitably surreal cameo. I had high hopes: perhaps a mini-game involving stealth or pursuit but I instead walked up to the animal,&nbsp; wrangled it into a container, and completed the objective. Likewise there are now Gate Quakes which shudder the land and can trigger an avalanche or rockfall. However. most of the time the screen shakes and not a single pebble moves, a random boulder plummeting down a hill would have added some excitement, even if it was off in the distance.</p>
<p>BTs, the tar-drenched phantoms that were a constant presence in DS1 are less of a threat as vast swaths of the map are devoid of of them. I found myself missing the tension of barrelling down a highway only to be abruptly confronted by squid-like terror erupting from the earth. When they do appear, there are some new variants, the most compelling of which is a colossal winged entity that soars overhead, deploying explosive payloads and countermeasures with the sophistication of a modern aircraft. Their seemingly erratic design belies a deeper narrative significance which is revealed in an epic battle near the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-460879">More deliveries than Amazon.</p>
<p>Given just how deeply reminiscent so much of this game is to its predecessor, I feared the experience might conclude without anything exceptional. It’s a sequel, so there’s bound to be common ground, but it feels like the second episode of a TV series rather than a blockbuster movie sequel. That is until Hideo Kojima metaphorically bursts onto the stage after 30 hours and the game descended into glorious, unhinged chaos. The story, which had until that point been a personal tale with subtlety and emotional restraint, suddenly swerves into a realm of outrageous, genre-defying spectacle. A late-game revelation left me so stupefied I had to pause for half an hour and process exactly what I had been told. Somehow, it makes sense within Kojima’s meticulously crafted mythology, but it is unquestionably batshit insane. Even if you had a hundred years, you would never guess what had been going on.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 ends on a high – a deliriously absurd, emotionally resonant, and breathtakingly bold high. I whooped. I laughed. I cursed. I even shed a tear. It was, without question, the most fun I’ve had in a game this year. Troy Baker absolutely steals the show in these final hours, delivering a performance that channels the anarchic menace of Heath Ledger’s Joker, amplified to eleventy-stupid. Norman Reedus, largely reserved throughout the journey and communicating in terse grunts, also steps into the spotlight with a moment of genuine pathos and gravitas to deliver at just the right time.</p>

<h2>How Do You Play&nbsp;the<em>&nbsp;HeroScape Age of Annihilation </em>Master Set?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-attack-example.jpg?itok=UX75SaM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-attack-example.jpg?itok=y5CdWzSR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In this example, the player on the left rolled two skulls to attack while the defending only rolled 1 shield, so defender takes one damage - simple as that!</figcaption></figure><p><em>HeroScape: Age of Annihilation</em>&nbsp;is a very straightforward skirmish wargame, which sees players assigning Order Markers to their units and activating them to move and attack if in range. The game focuses a lot on movement, with easy-to-build hex-based terrain. Some characters can fly, but for most of them, you'll be carefully examining the height and distance of your opponent's characters.</p>

<p>Combat is simple as can be, with attackers rolling a number of dice equal to their attack value, and defenders rolling dice equal to their defense. It's all extremely accessible, and that accessibility is only increased by inclusion of "simple" and "master" sides to every character card. This allows younger players, or people less familiar with more complicated wargaming rulesets, to get into the fight.</p>

<p>The "master" side of each character or squad's card is where we get a bit more into the weeds, but nothing on these cards is so complicated as to bring this game into the realm of a crunchier skirmish wargame. This is a system I'm quickly growing to love, and it all comes from this incredible assortment of quirky and clever characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-activation-example.jpg?itok=s7SL-wsO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-activation-example.jpg?itok=2qy_ORZd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even tracking who attacks when is easy, with players assigning these tokens (and one fake-out token) to their character cards. You can even double up on a card to have it activate multiple times!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Characters of the&nbsp;<em>HeroScape Age of Annihilation</em> Master Set</h2>

<p>From undead warriors to four-armed robot admirals, giant dragons to cybernetically augmented polar bears, the characters in this game are absolutely the heart and soul of&nbsp;<em>HeroScape</em>, and the twenty different figures included in the Master Set are iconic. I'll speak briefly here about each character and squad. Without getting too in-the-weeds about their specific stats, we can still get the flavor of each.</p>

<h3>Admiral EJ-1M</h3>

His ability to move order tokens you place on him onto other pirate or captain models makes him incredibly tricky, as does his special ability that lets him move your other pirates around.</p>

<h3>Dorim The Bulkhead Brawler</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-dorim-dwarf.jpg?itok=qfOzFplJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-dorim-dwarf.jpg?itok=ku8Zv4GE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is this hearty Dwarf, Dorim! While his charge ability only works with other creatures who can bond with him and jump in line before their order token is revealed, his static ability to re-roll one of his four attack dice is pretty huge! And even though I'm not a huge fan of steampunk aesthetics, I have to say I like his swashbuckling look.</p>

<h3>Loviatäk The Kyrie Warrior + Exiles of the Sundered Seas</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-kyrie.jpg?itok=9Ob8qI1g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-kyrie.jpg?itok=b0dzihvu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Loviatäk The Kyrie Warrior, with her fiery red skin and leathery black wings, wields a battle-axe and exudes a Brutality Aura that allows another squad figure in her range to re-roll their attacks. And if you build around her, adding 1 to the move value of your entire army is pretty huge!</p>

<p>And as for the squad also pictured in this image, these pirates are as slippery as a space-eel! You can upgrade their range by 4 spaces with a special ability, attempt to roll your way out of ranged damage, and can slide out of a fight without getting hit (the game has a similar mechanic to attacks of opportunity ala&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D</em>, or disengagement attacks you see in most wargames).</p>

<h3>Misaerx The Kyrie Warrior</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-misarex.jpg?itok=KIZGGiQE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-misarex.jpg?itok=R9NoOoHJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Misaerx The Kyrie Warrior really showcases what I love about this game - they're willing to let a character be, for lack of a better term, a "one trick pony."</p>

<p>She life-drains your opponents, and when she dies, you place her on another Unique hero you control and now&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;life-drain. In another game system, this would be cluttered with other abilities, over-complicated, but here - Renegade just lets the design breathe a bit!</p>

<h3>Knaves of the Silver Scimitar</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-pirates.jpg?itok=l4r8taUu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-pirates.jpg?itok=Mk3fw_HQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Knaves of the Silver Scimitar - yes,&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>pirates - really care about having a captain. Like any good crew, they allow you to sneak in a turn with their captain first, and gain an additional defense die when they can see their cap'n. They also gain extra attack dice when they run in to fight, and can slip away like other pirates we've seen.</p>

<p>What I think most draws me to these figures is the way they each have a very different look, but clearly belong to the same crew. If you look carefully, you wouldn't need to tell from the character card that these four belong together - though they're different species and have different dress - that's just good design!</p>

<h3>Knight Irene and the Frostclaw Paladins</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-polar-bears.jpg?itok=dA1XqoqO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-polar-bears.jpg?itok=BCdt_Xly 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knight Irene is an absolutely hulking figure with a lot of mobility on her card thanks to her "Run 3" special ability, which lets her trade attack dice for running speed. So cover the distance with her, and then next turn you can overwhelm with an attack dealing extra dice!</p>

<p>Pair her with her Frostclaw Paladins, and you've got a very nasty combo here - they also have Run 3, but are also bonded with a Jandar Champion (which Knight Irene is). This will allow you to take an extra turn with Knight Irene (regardless of whether she's activated or even has an order token on her)!</p>

<h3>Raakchott, Steward Of Death</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raakchott.jpg?itok=dqxlVio1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raakchott.jpg?itok=V2JffFBu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a name like Raakchott, Steward of Death it's got to be good! And while you can't make use of her Command Familiar ability out of the box (there are no small or medium beasts), her Soul Fury special attack is one of the only Area of Effect attacks in the box, letting you dish out a massive blast of soul energy to everyone adjacent to you!</p>

<p>But let's be real, the best part about this character is the absolutely unhinged and awesome design of the miniature itself. A malevolent (is it malevolent, I honestly don't know) force of death crafted from twisting vines, branches, and dead animal bones? Sign me up!</p>

<h3>Raelin The Kyrie Warrior</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raelin.jpg?itok=EoxqLn4g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-raelin.jpg?itok=qfq75guV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Raelin the Kyrie Warrior is one of the two figures in the box that take up more space on the board, and she's absolutely fantastic looking! And this is another big, important model with very clean and uncomplicated design. If your enemies are within 4 spaces of her, she scares them and they roll 1 less Defense die.</p>

<p>And if she inflicts at least 1 wound in a normal attack, she's auto-dealing another wound. In short: She's scary and she hits hard! What's not to love?</p>

<h3>Xenithrax The Vineweaver</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-xenithrax.jpg?itok=aZIL5s0X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-xenithrax.jpg?itok=EE5cAFEi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, let's talk about the biggest model in the box, the majestic Xenithrax The Vineweaver! Clocking in at 200 points, Xenithrax can lay vines down on the board which lower the attack and defense value of anyone on them, and their Erupting Earth Special Attack allows you to chain attacks, hitting adjacent enemy after adjacent enemy if they're all lined up next to each other.</p>

<p>Hitting hard, flying around the board, making it harder for non-flying characters to get around - Xenithrax is truly a setpiece character, and one of my favorites to play around with on the board.</p>

<h2>Do I Need To Build Around Army Factions?</h2>

<p>No! You don't need to build around various Army Factions, creatures types, or any other restrictions when building your battle forces in the&nbsp;<em>HeroScape Age of Annihilation</em>&nbsp;Master Set (or the game at large) - which makes army building so unique. If I want my polar bear Paladins to partner up with a bunch of pirates, that's fine! It may not be the most synergistic, but if I'm having fun - or can think of other cool ways different units interact, that's all that matters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-feature-shot.jpg?itok=9L1NwdJe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/1-heroscape-age-of-annihilation-master-set-feature-shot.jpg?itok=4_id2BFn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>HeroScape Age of Annihilation Master Set - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>What can I say, I'm completely blown away by this new iteration of&nbsp;<em>HeroScape</em>&nbsp;- I never played it when it first came around, so I really didn't know what to expect coming into Renegade's new take on the game. Though, to be fair, it's not really a new take, since all old figures ever produced for <em>HeroScape </em>are compatible with the new version of the game - which we love to see!</p>

<p>With crystal clear rules, great miniature design, and approachability for all levels of gameplay, this is both an entry-level game&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a can be delved for more strategic depths by simply flipping your cards over to the Master side. I can't recommend this game enough if you're a fan of skirmish gaming.</p>

            <p>Having Mario Kart World include a roster of characters from other Nintendo series would have been "incongruous".</p>
<p>That's according to Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki, who recently discussed why the likes of Legend of Zelda's silent hero Link and Animal Crossing's Isabelle weren't part of the game's line up of racers, as they were in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>, Yabuki told Ouest-France the inclusion of characters from other games in the Mario Kart World universe would have been both "incongruous" and, quite simply, unnecessary.</p>
<p>"It didn't seem necessary, given everything we could already do with Mario," Yabuki <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">told the publication</a> (via machine translation). "We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this cast. But there are so many characters and so many costumes that there's sure to be something for everyone."</p>
<p>Now, this isn't to say that Mario Kart World doesn't include new characters along with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Peach, Bowser, Luigi and other regular faces in the Switch 2's launch title</a>. It's just that these characters - such as the Piantas from Sunshine and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cows-are-taking-over-mario-kart-world">course the Moo Moo Meadows Cow</a> - are <em>already </em>part of the Mario universe.</p>
<p>Yabuki said the Mario Kart World team always hoped these characters would "be a good surprise for players", and the "welcome was so warm that it surprised even us". As for the developer's personal favourite racer, well like us the producer has a bit of a soft spot for Cow.</p>

<p>Nintendo's approach is in contrast to Sega's forthcoming rival <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">include plenty of characters from outside the Sonic universe</a> - including Hatsune Miku, Steve from Minecraft, and Spongebob Squarepants.</p>
<p>If you are still on the fence about giving Mario Kart World a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>, where our Tom said how the game "offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula", calling it all "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>
<p>Or, if you are already familiar with the bones of Mario Kart World, but need a little hand to get a bit more out of it (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unlocking-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world-is-so-obtuse-even-nintendo-got-the-details-wrong">like unlocking that infamous Mirror Mode</a>, for example), you can check out our guides.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display is problematic in a number of ways, and it's even worse than its predecessor's in certain scenarios, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Around two weeks after the system launched in most of the world, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared a two-hour-long review of the Nintendo Switch 2, going over every aspect of the system in great detail. Being the first Nintendo system to offer features that have become widely adopted in handheld devices since the launch of the original Switch, great attention has been reserved for the system's display, and the verdict is not good, as the display proved to be problematic in a number of ways. As already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">highlighted</a> earlier this month, HDR support is extremely disappointing, as an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range. Motion quality is possibly even more disappointing, as its blurring characteristics easily make the new system's panel worse than the original Switch's display. The difference in quality becomes even more evident when comparing the Nintendo Switch 2's display with the Switch OLED panel.</p>
<p>It's not just HDR and motion quality that disappoint in the Nintendo Switch 2 display, but also VRR support. There's reason to believe, however, that VRR support could be improved in the future, as Digital Foundry highlighted how Welcome Tour reveals support for LFC, low frame-rate compensation, which should improve the experience when hitting framerates outside the 40- 120Hz VRR window.</p>

<p>Though its display disappoints, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a clear upgrade over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

<p>Bricking it</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="mig bans" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b279277ed479/mig-bans.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we reported <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-reportedly-banning-switch-2s-using-mig-cartridges">last week</a>, Nintendo has been banning <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles from using online services if it finds them to be using MiG carts, effectively 'bricking' the new consoles by denying them any online access whatsoever.</p>
<p>Nintendo has seemingly decided to come down tough on this issue for its new generation of system, with social media and internet forums slowly coming alive with users who've been faced with an “Error Code: 2124-4508” message. However, a potential knock-on effect is that the secondhand market for Switch 2 consoles may be becoming a bit of a dodgy death run for those seeking a cheaper option on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/used-nintendo-switch-2-bricked-3569050/">Android Authority</a>, at least one potential Switch 2 owner has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1lew6m5/found_one_didnt_end_well">shown up online</a> to report that their console, bought at a discount, was actually 'bricked' with the same error code message. Not ideal.</p>

<p>Piracy has been a scourge for Nintendo, particularly over the past few years with some high-profile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/watch-out-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-leaks-are-out-in-the-wild">pre-release leaks</a>. With carts such as the MiG providing a route to play ripped, pirated copies of games, it's perhaps inevitable that potential buyers are going to have to be extra careful going forward.</p>
<p>In the case above, where the console was bought at a Walmart, it was an easy case of returning the console for a refund without an issue. Start getting these problems with tech bought on the likes of eBay, Gumtree, or other sites, though, and forking out for a secondhand Switch 2 could end up being quite the sweat-inducing prospect.</p>
<p>Will potential Switch 2 owners need to work out some way of having proof provided by private sellers? If the online banning continues as it appears it has done in these early days, we'll be hearing more about this problem as a mountain of bricked hardware begins to pile up.</p>
<p>For stores, too, how do they verify that a console isn't 'bricked' before they accept a return? There's a lot of potential verification time to be spent on an extra layer of checks on returned goods.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be sure to keep you updated.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-large-scale-development-is-no-longer-sustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help.1225530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-smash-bros-ultimate-best-ever/">Super Smash Bros. series</a> creator Masahiro Sakurai thinks that generative AI can help in a time when large-scale development has become unsustainable for various reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITmedia</a>, the creator of one of the most beloved Nintendo franchises ever made commented on the current game development landscape, saying that large-scale development is increasing in size, and is now time-consuming and unsustainable, so much so that Sakurai-san feels that things cannot continue the way they are. Game development has to change, and one of the solutions to this issue is using generative AI, which can be used to improve efficiency. Ultimately, according to Sakurai-san, we have reached an era where only companies that can adapt to this sustainability problem can survive.</p>
<p>While Masahiro Sakurai's statement could be interpreted as a full-on endorsement of the use of generative AI in game development, ResetERA forums member sprsk <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/#post-141809601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a bit of context related to the Japanese game development landscape. According to the user, the talent pool in Japan is getting smaller and smaller, and so there are not enough developers to sustain large-scale development, thus, using generative AI could help in a scenario where there are not enough developers. The user added that hiring from overseas could be a solution, but the language barrier will always be a problem, making it difficult to fill the gaps in talent in Japan this way.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a high-profile Nintendo developer, such as the Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai, has commented on generative AI use in game development. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto weighed in on the matter, highlighting how Nintendo tends to go the opposite direction the industry as a whole goes, directly referencing the AI craze that is increasingly threatening jobs in game development.</p>

                <p>Last year, CD Projekt Red unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> and confirmed that Ciri is the game's new main character. This shouldn't have been to surprising to fans after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, but there has been some pushback from players who don't want Geralt of Rivia to take a backseat to his adoptive daughter. Now, one of the developers behind the upcoming game is asking fans to wait for The Witcher 4 to be released before passing judgment on Ciri's time in the spotlight.</p><p>"When the game will be out, you'll be able to see for yourself and fully embrace her character, her story," said The Witcher 4 engineering production manager Jan Hermanowicz during an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-dev-says-its-very-clear-that-ciri-is-the-right-choice-of-protagonist-but-that-players-shouldnt-make-opinions-until-the-game-is-out/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>. "And I think that will be the moment to make opinions and make the calls."</p><p>He went on to add that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">the first teaser trailer for the game</a> showed Ciri in "two emotional states [that were] very distinct from one another," before adding that the finished game will have a more rounded out depiction of her personality. Hermanowicz also echoed Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle by pointing out that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">original Witcher stories set up Ciri to be the lead</a>.</p><p>"For me, personally, reading the books, it's very clear that the story slowly transitions from being Geralt's story to really being Ciri's story, sometimes narrated through the eyes of Geralt,' added Hermanowicz.</p><p>CD Projekt Red recently shared a tech demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">The Witcher 4 at State of Unreal</a> that offered an enticing glimpse at what's coming down the line. However, CDPR later noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">the tech demo wasn't actually The Witcher 4</a>, it was just set in the world of the game.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't currently have a release date, and it's unknown if it will debut during this console generation or during the next generation.</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be a passing joke, but it certainly appears to be hinting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is considering a Switch 2 version of the latest in the mainline series.</p>
<p>Not only would this follow the Xbox version, but it would follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">Final Fantasy 7 Remake games also coming to Switch 2</a> - all as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Two questions remain, though: would Final Fantasy 16 run on Switch 2? And would it sell?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjmzmgeqFYA">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the Xbox Series X/S version of Final Fantasy 16 has issues with a softer resolution implemented in order to secure a stable frame rate. It's unclear how the lower powered Switch 2 would be able to handle the game, especially in handheld mode.</p>
<p>It's also <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-16-may-have-underperformed-on-ps5-but-its-doing-terribly-on-xbox">been reported</a> Final Fantasy 16 has not sold well on Xbox Series X/S so far, although Square Enix is yet to officially comment.</p>
<p>As such, while Square Enix's multiplatform strategy will certainly open up its games to more sales, perhaps there just isn't enough interest in Final Fantasy 16 specifically at this point, two years after its initial PS5 release. Maybe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-remake-are-finally-on-xbox-but-is-it-too-late">sales would have been stronger with a multiplatform launch</a>, though of course this still would not have factored in Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">third-party games are reportedly not selling well on Switch 2</a> as Nintendo's own games - in this instance Mario Kart World - are dominating the system. We'll have to see how Final Fantasy 7 Remake sells on the system later this year to gauge how Final Fantasy 16 may fare.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ad1f1337a4f7/masahiro-sakurai-on-creating-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qPqBilhEtI">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434">a Yahoo Japan interview</a> (geo-locked) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> lead and game dev extraordinaire Masahiro Sakurai has blown up in the West, with reports suggesting that the Kirby creator is advocating for generative AI. However, it seems the nuance of his comments have gotten a little lost in translation.</p>
<p>Translated quotes shared on social media suggested Sakurai saw AI as a solution to the issues facing developers of large-scale games, although prominent posters such as <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1936888173327433860">Stealth</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936935928666501290">Genki</a> have since removed initial posts as more nuanced interpretations of his interview comments have been proposed.</p><p><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In the interview, when asked about the future of the games industry, Sakurai said he doesn't believe the current development model is sustainable due to the amount of time and work involved in producing the biggest games.</p>
<p>He followed this with comments on generative AI which were initially taken as endorsement, although as pointed out by others online, the tone is one of disappointment about the realities of AAA game dev and uncertainty about its future, not 'AI is the solution'. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">Jenny on Bluesky</a> sums it up like this:</p>
<figure><a title="jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬ Bluesky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9aaecc75c6c63/jenny-atmiinipah-subahibi-net-bluesky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For comparison and context around the blow-up, here's Google's stab at machine-translating the relevant section of the interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While game development is becoming larger and more specialized and fragmented, the indie game market, which is made by one person or a small group of people, is also growing. What do you think about the future of the game market?</strong><br>
To be honest, it's impossible to tell what's going to happen in a moment. I think that if you try to make a large-scale game like the current one, it's too much work and it's not sustainable. I feel that we can't continue like this, but at the moment, the only effective solution I can think of is generative AI. I feel that we've reached a stage where we have to change the scheme, such as by using generative AI to improve work efficiency. And I think that we will enter an era where only companies that can respond well to this change will survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it looks like another example of machine-translated text not quite capturing the nuance of the comments or the context of the conversation. Given Sakurai's extensive dev experience (which he's channelled into his enormous and excellent video series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a>), having him suddenly extolling the virtues of AI-authored content would be something of a turn.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that he was just commenting on AI as a solution being proposed by some at a time when AAA game development is more costly and time-consuming than ever.</p>
<p>Sakurai is currently working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Switch 2, the sequel to the GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, which is currently set to launch in '2025'.</p>

<p>The emulator is a passion project that reimagines classic NES games by turning them from 2D to playable 3D voxel dioramas. The improvements introduced to the supported games don't stop here, as the emulator introduced real-time lighting and shadows and animated skyboxes that breathe new life into some all-time classics. Unfortunately, the emulator doesn't yet support every NES game, but among the 100+ currently supported games are the Super Mario Bros. games, Contra, Metroid, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Duck Hunt, Mega Man, Castlevania, and others. The list of supported titles is constantly expanding thanks to the work of the <a href="https://itch.io/board/872690/profile-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community,</a> which is creating custom profiles using 3dSenMaker.</p>
<p>In case you have never seen the 3dSen emulator in action, you can check out the trailer below shared to celebrate its 1.0 release.</p>

Sony hasn't provided an official map of the Death Stranding 2 release times, but with a rolling midnight launch it can get pretty confusing. To save figuring out when Death Stranding 2 launches in your area, we've got all of the release times for every region below, thanks to a countdown that appears in the Deluxe Edition version of the game upon pre-installing it.</p><p>There are two separate release dates for Death Stranding 2. The first is the early access version for those of you that purchased the Digital Deluxe or Collector's Edition of the game, and this will be released on June 24. The full release date is June 26, for everyone else. Since the early access version is advertised as 48 hours prior to the full release, this ensures that we know the release times for both versions.</p>

<p>Since PlayStation uses a rolling midnight release schedule, Death Stranding 2 will be available at midnight in the easternmost timezone of your area. For example, in the US, Death Stranding 2 will be released at midnight in New York, which is on Eastern Time. 11:00 PM in Chicago, which is on Central Time, and 9:00 PM in Los Angeles, which is on Pacific Time.</p><p>You can use similar calculations to work out when Death Stranding 2 is released in each Australian time zone--as long as you set the easternmost zone as midnight, it's easy to work out the rest.</p><h2>Death Stranding 2 early access release time</h2><p>If you purchased the Deluxe Edition or Collector's Edition of Death Stranding 2, the game will release at the following times in your area:</p><ul><li><b>ET</b> - June 24, 12:00 AM</li><li><strong>PT</strong>- June 23, 9:00 PM</li><li><strong>BST</strong> - June 24, 5:00 AM</li><li><strong>CEST</strong> - June 24, 6:00 AM</li><li><strong>IST</strong> - June 24, 9:30 AM</li><li><strong>JST</strong> - June 24, 1:00 PM</li><li><strong>AEST</strong> - June 24, 2:00 PM</li></ul><h2>Death Stranding 2 release time</h2><p>For players with the standard edition of the game, the full release times are:</p><ul><li><b>ET</b> - June 26, 12:00 AM</li><li><strong>PT</strong>- June 25, 9:00 PM</li><li><strong>BST</strong> - June 26, 5:00 AM</li><li><strong>CEST</strong> - June 26, 6:00 AM</li><li><strong>IST</strong> - June 26, 9:30 AM</li><li><strong>JST</strong> - June 26, 1:00 PM</li><li><strong>AEST</strong> - June 26, 2:00 PM</li></ul><p>While it's not long before you can get your hands on the game, director Hideo Kojima said that Death Stranding 2 was his "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-was-kojimas-most-difficult-challenge-and-was-nearly-canceled/1100-6532495/" data-ref-id="1100-6532495">most difficult challenge</a>" and was almost canceled.

		<p>If you’re a returning fan of the series, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4 might make you question the nature of time and mortality. The demo for this remade duology – currently available to those that pre-order the game on PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC – opens with a collection of live footage from the included skaters, that roster including Riley Hawk, Tony Hawk’s adult son, 15 year-old Chloe Cavell, and Olympic star Rayssa Leal, who was born in 2008. For all that this is a remake and remaster of two games from 2001 and 2002, time has definitely passed for Tony Hawk and the skateboarding scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 | Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYmlS8zwb5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What it does show is that the skateboarding scene is not just alive and well, it’s kickflipping its way into a whole new generation’s hearts. The easy ability to share clips worldwide, the sport reaching all the way to the Olympics, and the resurgence of games like Skate and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater speaks to a sport that’s in rude health. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is only going to cement that further.</p>


<p>The demo gives you two skaters, Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, though there is a third available if you’ve preordered the Deluxe Edition of the game. That third option is the Slayer from Doom, and maybe it’s just me, but does the Doom guy really seem like the most obvious choice for hitting a wicked Manual and bouncing into a cool kickflip? Weirder tie-ins exist, for sure, but I don’t think it’s the biggest draw for a Deluxe Edition, which also gives you a horrific alien Revenant skater too. If Doom is your favourite franchise, then maybe you’re spending the extra. At least Bam Margera is lurking around the final release.</p>
<p>The demo has two areas, Foundry and College, and it’s little surprise to find that these levels look absolutely stunning on current-gen hardware. Running in 4K, 60fps on PlayStation 5, Foundry has molten metal and jets of steam spilling out into the arena, as well as a focused set of rails, ramps and half-pipes, with the build feeling quite claustrophobic, forcing you to make split-second decisions to keep your combo going.</p>


<p>It’s definitely a more intense option compared to the sprawling College level. Here, those two minutes you’re given feel utterly lacking, as the number of options, hard-to-reach sections and potential routes spiral into the hundreds, if not thousands. It looks stunning, and I loved re-learning the techniques that fans of the series will have embedded in the back of their brain. Rightly or wrongly, grinds and manuals feel more natural now, flowing together more readily than they did when I was younger, but perhaps that’s just the result of familiarity and practice that have been years in the making.</p>
<p>Even in the demo you can dig into your skater’s setup swapping out or adding additional special moves, changing the inputs for these, or altering a few of the cosmetic options, like the board designs. You do earn money through each run, and while there’s no options here to spend it, I’m sure you’ll be buying your favourite skater’s different looks in the full release.</p>
<p>That will undoubtedly play into the upcoming Create-A-Skater mode, so you’ll be able to put yourself (or at least a version of yourself that can ride a skateboard without falling off) into the game. That sits handily alongside the Create-A-Park mode, which lets you create your own park from the ground up. I’m expecting this to run better than ever too, with the current gen horsepower behind them.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s would be nothing without the right soundtrack, and the demo gives you the requisite mix of bands like CKY and Motorhead nuzzling up to Lupe Fiasco for a great mix of vibes while you attempt to land that 900. It’s a real shame to find that some songs from the original games have been cut – an announcement from Alien Ant Farm dropped this week saying they were out – but we won’t know the full track list until we have the final game in our hands. You can remove any songs from the rotation if you don’t like them, and there’s some original tracks from Logan Byers that you can add in as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest surprise about THPS3+4 is that Activision have opted for a mid-range pricepoint of £39.99, which feels like a great price to jump in at, particularly on Switch 2 during its release window. For those on Xbox, it’s also going to be there day one on Game Pass, giving you no reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk’s has never felt smoother, or looked better, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 looks like the perfect way to blend the old-school and the new-school together when it releases for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series consoles, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenia-canary-development-team-is-not-working-with-microsoft-on-the-xbox-classics-program.1225476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenia Canary development team is not working with Microsoft on the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-classics-emulator-enhancements/">Xbox Classics program</a>, the team itself confirmed in a new statement shared online.</p>
<p>As reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lhsg0m/xenia_team_post_official_response_about_rumoured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the development team of the Xbox 360 emulator confirmed on their official Discord server that they are not associated with Microsoft by any means, nor are they working with the company in any capacity. Microsoft uses its own emulation to deliver backward compatibility on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, the team added, and, as such, has no reason to collaborate with Xenia if they ever decide to bring their games to PC.</p>
<p>Though one may argue the Xenia Canary team could never confirm they are working on the Xbox Classics program under an NDA, if the team actually signed such an agreement, they would keep their silence on the matter, so at this point, there's no reason not to believe the developer's official statement. This doesn't mean that Microsoft isn't working on bringing classic Xbox games to PC and current consoles, but it also makes the rumor less credible, although the original leaker has doubled down on the matter, saying that such a program is indeed in the works and will be revealed next year to coincide with Xbox's 25th anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Nintendo Racers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7725d4c79231/mario-kart-world-nintendo-racers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's no denying that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> packs a pretty impressive roster of racers (come on, 50 characters, <em>plus</em> costumes ain't bad), but we'd be foolish if we didn't pour one out for the familiar faces that were lost along the way. We're talking, of course, about the <del>Koopalings</del> wider Nintendo characters that got cosy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, but missed out on the starting line this time around.</p>
<p>Link, Isabelle, the Villagers and the Inklings no longer grace the character select screen in World, and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">Ouest-France</a>, producer Kosuke Yabuki explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>According to Yabuki-san, the Mario Kart World development team felt the line-up was already beefy enough, <em>without</em> Link and co. in tow. "As developers, it would have seemed incongruous to us to add characters from other games into this universe," he told the French outlet (via Google Translate), "And it didn't seem necessary to us, given everything we could already do with Mario".</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/this-is-it-nintendo-on-why-it-added-cow-into-mario-kart-world">Ask the Developer interview</a> gave us some insight into how excited the developers were to add the likes of Cow to the game, so it makes sense that the team would want to keep going with as many Mario regulars as possible. We'd be on that character select screen all day if they started adding lil guys from <em>every</em> Nintendo franchise, after all.</p>
<p>And, let's admit it, we've all gone crazy for some of these newbies, regardless of where they came from. "The reception has been so warm that it surprised even us," Yabuki-san told Ouest-France, "It definitely exceeded our expectations".</p>
<p>"We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this casting," Yabuki-san concluded, "But there are so many characters and so many costumes that every player is sure to find something to suit them".</p>
<p>Part of us assumed that Mario Kart would balloon into some sort of Smash-style 'Nintendo Kart' for the next entry, so it's actually pretty refreshing to see the Big N go in the opposite direction. And besides, who's choosing Link over Monty Mole?</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players might have managed to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">stop the Illuminate</a> from totally destroying their home planet towards the end of last month, but it still got pretty badly trashed. Enter the game's latest mission - kick off the Super Earth rebuild by securing "reparations".</p>
<p>How are those funds being secured, you ask? This is Helldivers 2, so it's by killing a bunch more baddies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The monumental effort to rebuild Super Earth is underway," confirms <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1934972239130107927">the order's briefing</a> from devs Arrowhead, "A full damage assessment has concluded, exhaustively detailing the incalculable wounds inflicted upon our sovereign homeworld — and their monetary cost, adjusted for inflation."</p>
<p>In order to pay those bills, players have been ordered to secure reparations by enacting some "compulsory asset forfeiture". Basically, they've got to kill 290 million Illuminate enemies and 2.9 billion bugs in just under a week.</p>
<p>Now, these sorts of 'kill a big number of things' orders have often been the most stark showcases of HD2 players' terrifying abilities when it comes to getting stuff done over the past year and a bit. Since they end as soon as the targets are reached, a number of them - especially those that target the squishable Terminid swarms - have ended early.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>MAJOR ORDER: The monumental effort to rebuild Super Earth is underway. </p><p>A full damage assessment has concluded, exhaustively detailing the incalculable wounds inflicted upon our sovereign homeworld—and their monetary cost, adjusted for inflation.</p><p>Pursuant to intergalactic law,… <a href="https://t.co/jpgEwYCOKQ">pic.twitter.com/jpgEwYCOKQ</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1936786795657589149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>This time, though, the sheer size of the bug kill total does look to be presenting a tough challenge thus far. As of writing, the game's <a href="https://helldiverscompanion.com/#overview">unofficial Galactic War tracking apps</a> say 223,303,766 Terminids have been terminated, putting the divers on track to overshoot the deadline of three days or so they've got. On the other hand, things are going great with the Illuminate, with players 41.3% of the way to their goal and looking set to hit it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lho812/new_major_order/">Reddit</a>, there might be a bit of fatigue regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-leans-hard-into-alien-vibes-as-players-fight-to-take-back-freaky-illuminatified-cites">Illuminate major orders</a> setting in at the moment, with some players wishing they'd been sent after the Automatons instead for this mission.</p>
<p>Outside of that live-service grind psychological insight, the interesting thing about this latest mission to me is that, assuming Super Earth does eventually get rebuilt, one would assume another battle for it might be in the cards down the line. It'll probably be a ways away, but I'd be intrigued to see how Arrowhead would go about trying to outdo the first big battle for the planet.</p>
<p>I'd think it'd maybe have to involve a new faction folks have spent less time fighting than the three in the game right now, and some sort of twist on the sequence of fights to hold different mega cities that we got first time around.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll stop speculating before I get to the point oftrying to guess what the second battle for Super Earth's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">commemorative cape</a> might look like.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-post-death-and-destruction-super-earth-rebuild-begins-financed-by-more-death-and-destruction]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Snap, the digital collectible card game that's been live for nearly three years, has been accused of stealing art from the Japanese tokusatsu drama Kamen Rider Wizard. More specifically, users <a href="https://x.com/Tewakuumea/status/1933090847089979699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> that the art used for the Ancient One's magic shield is nearly identical, as you can see in the comparison below.</p>


<p>The original designer of Kamen Rider Wizard, which aired a total of 53 episodes between September 2012 and 2013, didn't take it very well. On their X account, they <a href="https://x.com/tajimax1968/status/1933479652292734983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oh my. I don't know this game, but this may be a huge rip-off. By the way, the dragon in the center is a PLEX design, and the outer circle surrounding it is all my own. The text is designed by my junior colleague and means a spell to gain power from magic stones. The text was written by K-kun from our literary team. Needless to say, everything is undoubtedly original.</em></p>
<p><em>As a designer, I find it distasteful. Above all, it is extremely disrespectful to fans of both characters. It ignores the original and is distributed and used as if it were originally this character's, which makes me feel angry and sad. Especially since I love MARVEL so much.</em></p>
<p>Griffin, the Community Manager of Marvel Snap, replied on the game's official Discord channel that the report is being 'investigated'. That was a while ago, however.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-working-to-restore-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to the forefront of gaming news earlier this year due to the temporary TikTok ban enforced in the United States. At the time, the game was still published by Nuverse, which is owned by ByteDance, the same company behind TikTok.</p>
<p>The ban only lasted a couple of days, but later in January 2025, Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner announced the decision to switch to Skystone Games, a US-based publisher.</p>

<p>Additionally, Round8 developers all got Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. We don't usually report on sales figures at RPS, but reading this made me picture an exhausted combat designer grinning and sipping margaritas in the sun while playing Mario Kart for a fortnight, which I consider an image worth sharing.</p>
<p>To spoon Marmite in the margarita somewhat, this obviously also stood out since stories like this can feel like the exception in a landscape where the reward for working on a successful game can just as often be unemployment, as was the case with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">US-based Marvel Rivals dev back in February</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's at least a few devs at Round8 that would have preferred the money over a console - giving out free Switch 2's feels somewhat like a conscious attempt to generate goodfeels press and pizza-party loyalty. Still, Kudos to Neowiz for being chill cool nice good dudes about it: your reward is one goodfeels press. Lies Of P's Overture DLC got a surprise release earlier this month at Medium Geoff's Bad Shoe Jamboree, which turned out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-alone-in-thinking-lies-of-p-overture-is-a-bit-tough-but-an-update-is-coming-to-smooth-things-over">be surprisingly difficult</a> at that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-free-nintendo-switch-2-two-weeks-paid-holiday-and-a-pile-of-money-for-lies-of-p-devs-after-hitting-sales-milestones]]></content:encoded>
