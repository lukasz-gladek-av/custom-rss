                <p>Horizon fans are eating well this year with impressive remasters and spin-offs, but for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Cyber Monday</a>, you can get them coolest gift of all: the elusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q46YHKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Horizon Forbidden West Tallneck set</a>.

Amazon restocked it relatively recently, but the strange thing is the retailer started selling it for above the original $90 list price. For the past few months if you wanted to build this very cool display model, you would have had to spend $100 or more. This $63 deal price isn't the lowest ever, but it's not far off.</p><p>And considering it's retired, this might be your last chance to get the Tallneck Lego set for anywhere close to this price.</p><p>The Tallneck is a lovely diorama featuring the titular mech, a smaller watcher robot, and a minifigure of Aloy on a decorative base.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-new-steam-review-rating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>No Man’s Sky has passed into the realm of ‘Very Positive’ on Steam after eight years on the market. The space-faring epic is one of the biggest rags-to-riches stories in gaming, and after eight years of solid updates and continuous content drops, it has managed to bump itself up a notch on the popular PC platform.</p>



<p>At launch, No Man’s Sky was crushed by negative reviews and paltry feedback that left players dismayed. The game had been a long time coming, and when it was released, it was in a shambolic state that put people off almost instantly.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-skyrocketing">Skyrocketing</h2>



<p>When Hello Games released No Man’s Sky, something of a panic took place. The developer became reclusive and impossible to reach, and the negative reviews continued piling up. The earliest updates failed to patch most of the game’s major problems, and the ambitious title became a laughing stock.</p>



<p>Over time, things stabilised, and the content was flowing regularly enough to keep a solid base of users entertained. By today, Hello Games has released a string of major updates that have left fans gobsmacked. With each new update, memes surface about Hello Games being <strong>too </strong>generous, with fans stressing that they’d happily pay for these sizeable expansions.</p>



<p>On Steam, No Man’s Sky just passed into ‘Very Positive’ where its all-time review count is concerned. It took this long to turn the numbers around, but today, the game is looking at a slew of reviews that are 82.1% positive, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>When the game came out, only 30 – 40% of the reviews were positive.</p>



<p>That’s a turnaround tale for the history books.</p>

We’re here to help you find the best picks for Nintendo's handheld while holiday shopping on a budget. Here's 12 Switch games under $30, and 9 more Switch games under $20.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Switch Game Deal, Period - Tears of the Kingdom for $30</h2><div catalogid="ddb149a2-d46b-4935-838f-af1cd363d65f" id="211153"><div id="211153" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you just want a straight answer about the best Cyber Monday game deal, look no further than <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3yJq?object_uuid=c5e46c35-809f-470a-a125-65e9c291ad3a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom for $30</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Tablet devices have come a long way over the last decade, but if you're looking for a quality screen, you're going to have to fork out some big cash for it. Fortunately, this Cyber Monday deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMPSWMJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 tablet</a> is a tempting one, as you can pick up a budget tablet for just $140, a 30% discount when compared to its regular $200 asking price.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lenovo M11 Tablet</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>$140 (<del>$200</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4407478" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4407478"></a><figcaption>Lenovo M11</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lenovo M11 is an 11-inch tablet with a 1920 x 1200 90Hz screen. Specs-wise, it has 4GB of RAM, and an internal SSD storage capacity of 64GB that can be expanded with an SD card. While there are certainly more powerful tablets on the market, this is a great choice for standard, every-day use, especially if you're looking for something to handle simple functions like web browsing, video streaming. It's also a nice option for kids who might be too old for one of Amazon's Kindle tablets, as it comes with a pen that can be used to take notes and create art, similar to the iPad and the Apple Pencil.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you need something more durable, Amazon is also selling a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMGKBK9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">version of this tablet for $160 that comes with a folio case</a>, so for the extra cash, you're getting a nice layer of protection with your purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Another affordable tablet you can check out during Cyber Monday is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ for $149</a> (was $220). It has a sharp 11-inch screen 64GB of internal storage capacity that can also be expanded through its MicroSD card slot, and it has a long-lasting battery. Don't expect resource-intensive apps to run smoothly on this, but again, if you're looking to browse the web, stream some TV shows, and do some social media scrolling, this is a budget-friendly tablet that can handle those tasks easily.In case the 64GB model doesn't offer enough room for all the files you want to use on it, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF2DNMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab a 128GB model for $199</a> (was $270). If you own a Samsung smartphone, you can link these devices up to quickly transfer files and photos using the company's app. </p><p dir="ltr">For a little bit more powerful, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-processor-throughout/dp/B0C1MYYFBW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's Fire Max is another good tablet to consider</a>. This is easily one of the biggest discounts we've seen to date for it, as you can grab 64GB model tablet with a keyboard case and a stylus for just $225 (was $355), or for the tablet on its own, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get it at a 39% discount for $140</a>. The 11-inch screen has a resolution of 2000 x 1200, the battery offers up to 14 hours of use from a full charge, and the included keyboard makes it a good back-up device for when you need to do some work away from home. </p><p dir="ltr">We've listed a few more tablet deals available in Amazon's Cyber Monday sale below.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has seen the addition of two major patches, bringing in over 650 fixes, which target bugs, crashes, and mission-specific problems.</p>
<p>GSC Game World has apparently acknowledged the widespread bugs that have ruined the experience for many players, and the developers are looking quite active in pushing out "effective" patches that include a large set of fixes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474617?l=english">Patch 1.0.1</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474746?l=english">Patch 1.0.2</a> were released in quick succession by GSC Game World, with the first one mainly dealing with improving the A-Life system, along with several optimizations, while the latter one targeted bug fixes for six different missions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An hour-long video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0">published Saturday</a> by Gamers Nexus, a YouTube channel focused on PC gaming hardware, accuses NZXT’s PC rental program of “bait-and-switch” tactics, with prices and specs that are constantly changing.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211490/nzxt-flex-desktop-gaming-pc-rental-service-subscription-nvidia-gpu-games">Flex program</a> allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 per month (not including a mouse, keyboard, or monitor). But Gamers Nexus shows that NZXT changes the specs and prices of PC models “day-to-day in some instances” and offers PCs with very different setups under similar model names depending on whether you are looking to buy or rent. The rapidly changing prices also obscure the potential value of listed “discounts” as the packages shift back and forth.</p><p>The video shows one instance of <a href="https://nzxt.com/product/player-three">NZXT’s Player: Three PC</a> listed as having an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics card, along with an Intel Core i7-13700KF with the “buy” option selected. However, viewing the same PC model under the “subscribe” option showed the same processor with a less powerful Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti. </p><p>Despite the different GPUs, it said NZXT listed both models as having the same estimated frames per second in games like <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare</em>.</p><p>Gamers Nexus also highlights other elements of the Flex program, like the pricing scheme that leads customers to pay more money than simply buying a PC outright and “aggressive” terms of service. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to NZXT with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back, and we haven’t seen a response posted in its community areas or social media channels.</p><p>“We just think this is a scam at this point,” Steve Burke, the editor-in-chief at Gamers Nexus, says during the video. “The performance claims alone are hugely misleading, especially since the only difference in one of these that’s meaningful is the word ‘Super,’ which a lot of people — especially those who are potentially renting or buying a pre-built — won’t catch.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m writing today with some news about <em>ANTONBLAST</em>‘s <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> version. </p><p>were very optimistic about launching the Nintendo Switch release day and date with the steam version on December 3 and have been working down to the wire to make sure it’s the absolute best it can be. However, it’s become apparent today that this version will not be ready on time for that date.</p><p>The reason for this is simple: We need more time to make sure that this version of the game is running at peak performance and meeting our own high standards, as well as <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,189 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a>‘s.</p><p>I can appreciate that this delay may be frustrating and I’d like to take this opportunity to personally apologize for the short notice.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Our partners at Nintendo have been incredible to work with, and together we are committed to giving Switch players the best experience possible. We are now in the process of sorting out the new release date on a schedule that works for all parties.</p><p>While I don’t have a specific date to announce today, we are aiming to release on Switch before end of year and will keep our fans updated every step of the way.</p><p>The Steam version of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> will launch as planned on December 3 at 12:00 p.m. ET.</p><p>For Kickstarter backers who wanted a Nintendo Switch key: You can swap to steam on your Fangamer survey at anytime, or simply hold off until the Switch version launches.</p><p>We’ll be doing a Twitch livestream that morning in anticipation of the launch, answering fan questions and showcasing the game. I hope I can see you all there!</p><p>Thank you all for your patience and support… we couldn’t do this without you.</p><p>—Tony Grayson, on behalf of Summitsphere</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve has removed a game from its British Steam storefront following a request from the UK's counter-terrorism unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714420/Fursan_alAqsa_The_Knights_of_the_AlAqsa_Mosque/">The FPS/TPS Fursan al-Aqsa: The Knights of the Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> - which describes itself as "address[ing] the Israel x Palestine conflict from a Palestinian perspective" - was removed when Steam contacted developer Nidal Nijm to inform him it had "received a request from authorities in the UK to block the game and have applied such country restrictions".</p>
<p>In an email to the Brazilian developer, Steam allegedly said: "We've received a request from authorities in the UK to block the game and have applied such country restrictions". When the developer reportedly asked if there was "a specific reason" for the UK ban and said "my game is not too much different than any other shooter game on Steam, like Call of Duty", he was told:</p>
<p>"We were contacted by the Counter Terrorism Command of the United Kingdom, specifically the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU). As with any authority for a region the [sic] oversees and governs what content can be made available, we have to comply with their requests."</p><p>In an email to <a href="https://www.404media.co/steam-removes-oct-7-game-at-request-of-uk-counter-terrorism-unit/">404</a>, a counter-terrorism spokesperson said: "The CTIRU works closely with a range of technology, social media and online service providers, but we do not comment on specific content or any communication we may have with specific platforms or providers."</p>
<p>"The region lock of my game in the UK was clearly due to political reasons," Nijm wrote in a statement to the same publication.</p>
<p>"I do not blame Valve nor Steam, the blame is on the UK government and authorities that are pissed off by a video game," Nijm said. "On their flawed logic, the most recent Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> should be banned as well. As you play as an American soldier and go to Iraq to kill Iraqi people. What I can say is that we see clearly the double standards."</p>
<p>The game - which was updated to include the 7th October attack given it released in April 2022 - calls itself "the Palestinian <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> on steroids" and the "most BASED game of all times". It has already been banned in Germany and Australia for not going through the countries' respective classification boards.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714420/Fursan_alAqsa_The_Knights_of_the_AlAqsa_Mosque/">The game</a> is still available to buy online outside of the UK, including the US. In the UK, however, the Steam page simply throws up an "Oops, sorry!" message, saying, "this item is currently unavailable in your region".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Personally, I’d go for the Disc Edition—it’s just $50 more, and you get the flexibility of physical games, which you can buy, sell, or trade later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer the Digital Edition, the NBA 2K25 bundle is a smart pick if you can find it in stock, as it includes a game.

Long answer: While major hardware discounts are rarely a sure thing on brand-new releases, Cyber Monday might bring some unexpected deals. In the announcement for Sony's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">lineup of holiday deals</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-black-friday-2024-sale-predictions">PS5 Pro</a> was (unsurprisingly) nowhere to be found. However, some retailers could surprise shoppers with modest discounts or exclusive PS5 Pro bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review">PS5 Slim</a>, for example, was released last year at a similar time and ended up getting a free game bundle (Spider-Man 2 or Modern Warfare 3) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-ps5-slim-spider-man-2-and-call-of-duty-ps5-black-friday-bundles">at the end of November</a>.

This bundle is an exceptional value, as it includes the headset and one of the best games to highlight its capabilities, all for the same price as the standalone PSVR2 during this sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this reduced price, the PSVR2 is a compelling alternative to budget-friendly VR options like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyber-monday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024">Meta Quest</a>, offering a premium virtual reality experience at a more accessible cost. Whether you’re upgrading from an older VR setup or trying VR for the first time, this deal provides a high-performance option that’s hard to overlook. For those eager to step into immersive gaming, now is the perfect time to take the plunge.</p></div><p id="ps5-ssd-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PS5 SSD deals">Cyber Monday Deals on PS5 SSDs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 games continue to grow in size, and with SSD prices climbing in 2024, finding the right storage at a great price is more important than ever. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> now here, there are plenty of discounts to explore.

To ensure optimal performance, you'll need a PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 drive with a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s to match the console's internal storage. To simplify your search, we've curated a list of SSDs that meet or exceed these requirements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PS Plus Cyber Monday Deal (Save 30%)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/54151004493-d618819f1a-k-1732112194364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Save up to 30% on PS Plus during Black Friday 2024.

<p>"From Tokyo 2099 to the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, and to Hydra Charteris Base and Klyntar, Galacta has assembled more heroes to take on the ultimate challenge," NetEase teases. "Who will you choose as your main to save the Multiverse on December 6th?"</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals is an upcoming free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter for PC with the backing of Chinese publishing giant NetEase.</p>
<p>Described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", Marvel Rivals pits teams of six against each other as they fight it out over a variety of destructible environments with characters from across the Marvel universe. Head of Marvel Games Jay Ong said Marvel Rivals is one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects", and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals finally releases in full on 6th December 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-tos-contains-a-non-disparagement-clause-to-prevent-players-giving-negative-reviews">NetEase was forced to apologise earlier this year</a> when players and content creators hit back at Marvel Rivals for a playtest terms of service contract that prohibited players from making "statements that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>
<p>In a statement posted in Discord shortly after the contract began to make headlines, the Marvel Rivals Content Creator Team said it "sincerely apologised" for the "miscommunication and your unpleasant experiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-switch-cyber-monday-deal-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Pick up this collection at its lowest price yet.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Amazon's kicked off its Cyber Monday sale</a> a little early this year and is still offering some great deals that are worth jumping on ahead of the holidays. In terms of video game deals, quite a few have caught our eye that have been brought over into the retailer's Cyber Monday sale, including an excellent discount on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1LZE?object_uuid=2b1cd6e2-864e-4a08-b68c-ca70a8b4fe28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0C93LGYCN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch owners can enjoy a nice 63% discount on this collection, which has brought its price down to just $18.74. According to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C93LGYCN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>, it's the lowest price its hit so far which is a massive bonus. A lot of deals like this won't stick around long after Cyber Monday, so if you've been wanting to add this stealthy series to your game library, now's the time.</p><div catalogid="e6bf14dc-1201-4240-b1c4-1ff7a2ef1ca2" id="212612"><div id="212612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty in this collection to keep you busy all throughout the holidays, too. It comes with Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Metal Gear (NES/FC version), and Snake’s Revenge. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> hopefully dropping sometime soon, there's never been a better time to sneak back into this series of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's got even more gaming deals in its Cyber Monday sale that are worth adding to your virtual shopping cart. Some big ones that got our attention were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Star Wars Outlaws, which remains on sale at $40 from Black Friday</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Sonic X Shadow Generations, which is down to just $30</a>. These just scratch the surface of what the retailer currently has available, though. To see more of our favorite deals outside of games, have a look at our breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Amazon's Cyber Monday sale</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday are likely to return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. Amazon, in particular, has already shifted gears to highlight its Cyber Monday deals early, so expect some amazing sales ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 1, 2024 3:16 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
