<p>Darwin's evolution</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this year, in Sony's February State of Play, Konami revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darwins_paradox">Darwin's Paradox!</a>, an octopus platformer with more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Inside</a>-esque stealth gameplay under the hood. A Switch 1 version was announced at the time, but a new trailer suggests that things might have made the jump entirely to Switch 2.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 icon at the end of the reveal trailer has been solely replaced by its Switch 2 counterpart in the new footage, accompanied by a <strong>2026</strong> release window.</p>
<p>So, the old hardware might be missing out, but the new trailer has got its tentacles around us, all the same. The Inside vibes are still present and correct, as Darwin the octopus stealthily completes platforming puzzles while avoiding the gaze of creepy, dystopian scenes in the background.</p>
<p>There are abilities like flying when filled with hot air, or twanging across large gaps that make things look a little more family-friendly than Playdead's depressing affair, but we sense there'll be a decent number of chills along the way, too.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screens from the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/darwins_paradox/">Konami website</a>, so you can get an idea of the dread under the colourful surface:</p>

<p>Alongside the new gameplay trailer, Konami has also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emK1N6GWvIU">Darwin's Paradox dev deepdive</a> with some of the team from ZDT Studio, which delves into the game's inspirations and stealthy protagonist.</p>
<p>So yes, the Switch 1 version may be dead in the water, but we'll be excited to check this one out on Switch 2 — hopefully with some improved specs to boot — at some point in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In 2010, when Microsoft unveiled the Kinect, it pitched the camera as a revolutionary new gaming device. Swing an imaginary lightsaber and that would be translated onscreen. Throw a football and it would be caught on your TV. Fifteen years later, we know the Kinect as an expensive failure. Microsoft overestimated the demand for playing games with your body. But the Kinect did still turn out to be revolutionary — just not for gaming.</p><div><p>Now, we understand the Kinect is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/mar/03/ghost-hunting-pornography-and-interactive-art-the-weird-afterlife-of-xbox-kinect">anything but a gaming device</a>. It became <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12559231">a robotics game changer</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/kinect-sex-game-offers-interactive-porn/story?id=12413950">enjoyed a brief dalliance with pornography</a>, and is now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638490/microsoft-kinect-ghost-hunting">upsold as a ghost hunting toy</a>. None of which would have been possible had a community of hackers not come together to fashion open source drivers for the Kinect, freeing it from the limitations of being locked to the Xbox 360 and opening new frontiers of experimentation, creative expression, and commercial advancement.</p></div><p>“Technically, nothing the Kinect did was entirely new,” says Memo Akten, <a href="https://www.memo.tv/">an artist working with code, data, and AI</a> and an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. The small camera projected a grid of infrared dots and read deformities in that pattern to discern depth. In an early example of machine learning, it recognized human limbs and gestures. “Those capabilities existed in research and industrial systems for many years,” he adds. Those systems cost in the region of $5,000 to $12,000. Here was Microsoft selling a variation of the technology for $150.</p><p>“What had previously required very expensive equipment and/or complex multi-camera setups with manual alignments, calibration, and correspondence was now available off the shelf,” Akten continues.</p><p>Kyle Machulis, CEO of Nonpolynomial and founder of <a href="http://buttplug.io/">buttplug.io</a> — an open source project for controlling sex toys — was working on $250,000 mapping systems not dissimilar to the Kinect in 2010. He quickly recognized the peripheral as an opportunity to “democratize that technology.”</p><p>He recalls heading out on November 4th to pick up a Kinect to reverse engineer. An hour later, New York-based DIY electronics producer Adafruit announced OpenKinect: <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2010/11/04/the-open-kinect-project-the-ok-prize-get-1000-bounty-for-kinect-for-xbox-360-open-source-drivers/">a bounty of $1,000</a> — a prize that it would raise to $3,000 — for whomever offered evidence of the Kinect working on any operating system.</p><p>“Imagine being able to use this off the shelf camera for Xbox for Mac, Linux, Win, embedded systems, robotics, etc.,” Adafruit wrote in its announcement. “We know Microsoft isn’t developing this device for FIRST Robotics, but we could! Let’s reverse engineer this together, get the RGB and distance out of it and make cool stuff!”</p><p>Doing so was not a simple case of taking the Kinect apart or plugging it in. Though it could connect to a PC via USB, the way they communicated was unknown and the only way to get at it was to watch the Kinect and Xbox 360 speaking to one another. “Since the Kinect didn’t have PC drivers, we needed this piece of hardware called a USB sniffer,” Machulis tells <em>The Verge</em>. A colloquial term for a protocol analyzer, a USB sniffer is a tool that could record the data passed between the Kinect and Xbox 360. In 2010, that cost $1,200 and, Machulis says, “I <em>really </em>didn’t want to buy it.”</p><p>Some information could be gleaned by simply connecting the Kinect to the PC, but it was mostly unhelpful — power consumption, packet sizes, and confirming the Kinect is, in fact, a camera. Hackers<em> could </em>start sending random packets and possibly work <em>something </em>out, but it was just as liable to brick the Kinect completely.</p><p>Hackers and reverse engineers around the world were raring to go. But it appeared that whoever got their hands on a sniffer would win the bounty almost by default. That race wasn’t just for the money, however, but also the cachet of being the first to hack such a high-profile device. With the community stalled over the massive expense — almost half the bounty — it opened the door for someone outside the community to potentially snatch the glory away.</p><p>To keep the contest equitable — and, perhaps, to try and maintain the bounty’s and the company’s momentum in the press, Adafruit took on that expense, ordering a sniffer to then release the logs to the community. But while everyone waited for the device to ship to Brooklyn, it appeared the worst had already happened and someone had beaten them to the punch.</p><p>“AlexP” released a video the next day <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkODbZwGinQ">demonstrating control of the Kinect’s motor</a> on PC. It prompted <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/bounty-offered-for-open-source-kinect-driver/">a panicked response</a> from Microsoft denying the Kinect could be hacked while threatening to explore legal options. Microsoft quickly U-turned when it became clear no one was trying to hack consumers’ cameras. But as the community reeled from potential litigation, AlexP returned with a second video. This time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18vSblw5SNk">he showed off depth and RGB images on PC</a>. The contest was over before it had begun.</p><p>AlexP didn’t claim the bounty, however. Instead, his company, Code Laboratories, opened a $10,000 “fund,” upon payment of which Code Laboratories would release the source code to the open source community. For some in the OpenKinect community, this wasn’t so far removed from what Adafruit — which was already benefitting from significant press — was doing. Even if Adafruit was looking to open source the Kinect drivers and Code Laboratories to sell the drivers as it had with the PlayStation Eye before. For others, it was tantamount to a ransom, withholding code that could make the Kinect more accessible and unleashing its potential easier. “But that was great motivation for the community to just be like: <em>Let’s take $10,000 away from you, actually</em>,” Machulis says.</p><p>A competitive edge shouldn’t be surprising in a contest for a bounty. According to Machulis, however, there was more to it. “That’s the thing about reverse engineering; It’s who gets their name on it first and loudest.”</p><p>On the evening of November 9th, Adafruit finally uploaded the logs collected by its sniffer, and the community began to pore over them. They were searching for the protocols that controlled the Kinect, exploring packets that might turn on a light, enable a camera, or operate the motor. It was incremental, tedious, and exhausting work.</p><p>As US hackers dropped off in the early hours, the clock ticked over to the Kinect’s European release date. Like his American peers, 20-year-old Hector “marcan” Martin purchased a Kinect and, armed with Adafruit’s logs, went through packet by packet to divine the Kinect’s protocols.</p><p>When the US woke, it did so to the fruits of his dogged examination: <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2010/11/10/we-have-a-winner-open-kinect-drivers-released-winner-will-use-3k-for-more-hacking-plus-an-additional-2k-goes-to-the-eff/">a video of Martin demonstrating RGB and depth on Linux</a>. It had taken six days for OpenKinect to hack the Kinect from its release — really, once the logs became available, it had taken Martin less than 24 hours.</p><p>That was far from the end, however. “Hector certainly did most of the hard, technical work in terms of getting the initial packets set up,” Machulis says. “Then everyone realized this shit is gonna get big.” The bounty claimed, the community set its sights on more drivers.</p><p>Theo Watson spent three weeks at his computer working on OpenKinect — every day, 10 hours a day. The Kinect revolutionized how <a href="https://www.design-io.com/">Design I/O</a>, which Watson co-founded, developed interactive installations, and he <a href="https://www.design-io.com/projects/connectedworlds">still uses it today</a>. In 2010, however, he was 30 years old, recently transplanted to the US, isolating limb data from infrared cameras.</p><p>“I saw that time off as an R&amp;D investment,” he says, a way to open more efficient avenues to bigger and better interactive experiences. “I really wanted to be the first person to get the Kinect running on a Mac.”</p><p>The OpenKinect community had coalesced around a remote nucleus of reverse engineers from different countries, generations, and demographic groups. There was drama, frayed nerves, but also a common goal, as Watson discovered while trawling through the process of running the Kinect on OSX.</p><p>“I think it really helped because it felt like you were part of a team effort,” he says. “If people were running into problems, it’s like having a collective brain. The Kinect basically needs everything to be perfect. If you’re off by one little thing, you don’t get anything. Then, suddenly, someone notices something and it works.”</p><p>Driven by the community, with a bit of help from Martin, Watson had the Kinect talking to Mac by November 12th. More drivers and code filled the community’s GitHub, and hacking efforts wound down. “There’s only so much to extract and then you have to be able to do something with that data,” Machulis says. “Those are two fairly different skillsets.”</p><p>Instead, people like Akten stepped in. The first open source drivers, libfreenect, didn’t include body tracking — Microsoft released its own skeletal SDK in 2011, its hand forced by OpenKinect — only granting access to raw depth data. “We could still do a lot with that,” Akten says. “For one thing, we had the 3D data, which allowed all kinds of creative, playful interpretations.”</p><div><p>The community chat flooded with experiments, many Akten’s. He explored <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F16818988" rel="sponsored">drawing in 3D space</a>, later moving on to develop <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F122166652" rel="sponsored">machine learning algorithms to detect poses</a>, and even <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F55125701" rel="sponsored">controlling drones</a>. The Kinect was open, bringing with it a host of explorations of how to exploit it creatively. Suddenly, an affordable way for robots to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01691864.2014.944212">detect obstacles and map environments in real time became available</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2014/01/13/exploring-medical-uses-of-kinect-technology/">surgeons explored examining scans contactless</a>, rapid <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/skanect/">3D models of rooms and objects</a> became a real possibility, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2012/03/06/teachers-are-using-kinect-for-xbox-360-to-engage-students-and-bring-learning-to-life/">teachers used the Kinect as an interactive learning device</a>, and, if you really wanted, <a href="https://www.metafetish.com/2010/11/28/kinect-sex/">someone could now control a sex toy</a> over a video call.</p></div><p>“This thing on the front camera,” Watson says, pointing to the black bar at the top of his iPhone’s screen, “that, I think, is a miniature Kinect.”</p><p>He’s almost wistful. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5141416/apple-confirms-primesense-acquisition">Apple purchased PrimeSense</a>, the Israeli company behind the Kinect’s sensor technology, in 2013. “I was so disappointed,” he says, “because I just knew that was the end of the Kinect technology.”</p><div><p>The sale prompted Microsoft to explore a new system for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4353232/kinect-xbox-one-hands-on">its next Kinect</a> — OpenKinect went and hacked that one too — discontinuing Kinect for Windows shortly after its release in 2014 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542870/microsoft-kinect-dead-stop-manufacturing">shutting down manufacturing for the Kinect in 2017</a> as sales diminished and it focused on the Kinect 2 and development of the third-generation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239860/microsoft-kinect-azure-dk-hands-on-mwc-2019">Kinect Azure</a>. Yet, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/17/16315510/iphone-x-notch-kinect-apple-primesense-microsoft">the technology has lived on</a>, incorporated into countless Apple devices as part of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/why-did-apple-buy-primesense-for-a-key-technology-itll-deploy-within-a-year">facial recognition and 3D mapping</a> to the point of being ubiquitous.</p></div><p>That sense of loss extends, in part, to the internet from which OpenKinect emerged. “It was way more punk rock!” Watson laughs. “No one had really established the rules.”</p><p>In 2010, the internet was unruly; it had yet to coalesce around the hubs it has today. Piracy was in its heyday, pre-AlexNet — a major neural network architecture that paved the way for modern AI models like Stable Diffusion — with GitHub, now an online staple, having released only three years before (the same year as Tumblr and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125849/iphone-history-pictures">the iPhone’s reveal</a>). “We were only four or five years into the maker movement,” Machulis says. “The idea of a product like this that has taken a massive amount of R&amp;D cost to be put out and hacked this quickly — it was basically unheard of.”</p><p>Now, with better tools, it’s far more common. Which is part of why we don’t hear about it as much as before — that, and not being attached to, as Machulis puts it, a “shining sun” of a product. “It is in general easier to make some of this stuff,” Machulis continues. “There’s way more communities online, there’s more content creators talking about this stuff.” The kind of effort surrounding opening the Kinect has now lost some of its buccaneering flavor, some of its sense of counterculture, simply by virtue of becoming more mainstream and, in many ways, more frequent. “I don’t think anything fizzled out,” Machulis adds. “I think it just got quieter and spread out.”</p><p>Still, there is a sense that how we approach technology has changed irreparably. “I think technology has become more of a product now and less something that you get involved with. That’s kind of sad,” Watson adds. “I kind of fear that the current generation is growing up just thinking the internet is inflexible. It is the way it is and nothing will ever change. We were constantly surrounded by that change. And it really made things feel more free and more open.”</p><p>Rather, similar communities to OpenKinect may feel invisible without a subject as high-profile as the Kinect. As the economic bubble inflating around AI grows more opaque as corporate interests scramble to make the technology a profit-turning industry, hackers have turned their attention to open sourcing its models. Aligned to a sprawling technology constantly in the public eye, it may well be that AI grants us our next big communal reverse engineering effort to echo OpenKinect. This is especially curious given the Kinect gave many of us our first interactions with AI, and it is AI that is finally interrupting the Kinect’s spirited afterlife.</p><p>“When the original Kinect came out, it took what might have been 100 hours of me writing computer vision code with a standard black-and-white infrared camera and gave me something that would shave that time off our development for a project <em>and </em>give better-quality results,” Watson says. “AI with code is doing a similar thing; they just take away the painful aspects of the work and let us focus on the creative part.”</p><p>Now, 15 years after hackers opened the Kinect to computer vision creatives, AI can do everything it did better, faster, and using standard RGB cameras. Watson shows <em>The Verge </em>a video of AI’s real-time tracking, its superior occlusion of limbs and digits blitzing across the screen as members of a K-pop group weave around one another, each marked by a colored skeleton on the screen — all pulled from an ordinary camera. “AI is made to make decisions about many things very quickly, and we need a decision about every pixel in an image,” Machulis says. “Since we can tell so much just from images now we may not need all the extra hardware, with methods like gaussian splatting we’re already seeing that ability to, what looks like, create information from thin air.”</p><p>“Next time we chat, we might have gone back to infrared cameras,” Watson says, before adding: “AI might kill the Kinect.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/812803/hacking-kinect-history]]></content:encoded>

<p>The wobble came on November 2nd, as the game was hovering around the 300 to 330k concurrent player mark.

As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday."</p>
<p>A "Server Slammer" variant of the hiker backpack has also been sent out to players who were present, so if that's you, there's a good chance both are already waiting in your inbox. Buying 500 tokes will set you back around £4 / $5 worth of real money, so it's a decently valuable gift in return for persevering through a technical hiccup that looks to have had relatively minimal impact in the grand scheme of server swoons.</p><p>Embark could easily have just shrugged and moved on without dishing out any goodies. From a cynical and PR-savvy perspective, it's an easy win requiring a bit of cash sacrifice, but likely returning plenty of value in the most important battle any shooter faces - the one over player hearts and minds. It's also just a nice thing to do.</p>

<p>While Fortnite players are currently enjoying the slew of The Simpsons-related content in the game, further big changes are on the horizon with the release date of Chapter 7 rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons will only be here for a few weeks before the setting of Springfield is left behind and a new adventure begins with Chapter 7, which will mark the start of the next year of content for Fortnite.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering just how long there is to enjoy The Simpsons content and want to know the release date for Chapter 7, we’ve got all the crucial details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-chapter-7-release">When Does Fortnite Chapter 7 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big things are coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite is set to kick off on November 29, following the end of The Simpsons-themed mini-season that brings a conclusion to Chapter 6.</strong></p>



<p>The end date of the current season, and the subsequent start of the next Fortnite chapter, was revealed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for The Simpsons mini-season, and we already know there will be the customary end-of-chapter event that marks the start of the new chapter.</p>



<p>Specific timing for the event and launch of Chapter 7 have not been revealed yet, however, and there will be downtime ahead of the start of the new chapter. Given how large of an update this will be, and the vast changes that will take place, the downtime could be longer than the standard end-of-season downtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-chapter-7">What’s Coming in Fortnite Chapter 7?</h2>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite will see vast changes to the game, with a new map in Battle Royale, a host of new weapons, and tweaks to core gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>In previous years, new chapters have resulted in huge introductions like Fortnite Festival and LEGO Fortnite, alongside marking the start of major new collaborations. While specifics are lacking at this stage, it certainly promises to be an exciting time for Fortnite players.</p>



<p>Leaks have already started ahead of Chapter 7, with it stated that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> will feature in upcoming collabs, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood setting is also rumored</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll also see the start of Winterfest 2025 during the first season of Chapter 7, likely during early December, which will likely offer the usual slew of free cosmetics.</p>

<p>Retroid has confirmed that there is no official licensing deal for Soulja Boy’s new handheld retro console, SouljaGameFlip. </p>



<p>The retro handheld console market has experienced significant growth in the past few years, with several new major players entering the scene in recent years. Retroid is a popular name in the retro handheld market, and it appears that some of their consoles are being sold by Soulja Boy as his own device, without an official deal in place. </p>



<h2 id="h-soulja-boy-is-selling-rebranded-retroid-consoles-at-more-than-double-the-price">Soulja Boy is Selling Rebranded Retroid Consoles At More than Double the Price </h2>



<p>Soulja Boy started marketing the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 as the SouljaGameFlip on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">souljaboygame Instagram account</a>. One of their recent post has the hip-hop artist showcasing the console in his hand while talking about all the games and apps it features, including “Sonic, TikTok, Instagram and everything ya need.” </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>, Retroid was not aware that Soulja Boy was selling their retro consoles as his own. The official statement from a representative states, “I didn’t know about this. This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves”. </p>



<p>If you visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.souljaboy.net/product-page/souljagame-flip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>&nbsp;where the SouljaGameFlip is being sold, it becomes blatantly obvious that the device is just a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2; even the images for the console are the same ones used on Retroid’s website. Furthermore, the rapper has more than doubled the price of the original console, with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 priced at $209 and the SouljaGameFlip costing $436.50. </p>

                <p>Nintendo has confirmed that in the last two quarters, it has sold a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">staggering number of Switch 2 consoles</a>. As part of its latest financial results, the company reported 10.36 million Switch 2 units sold as of September 30, in the two quarters since it went on sale. In the last three months alone, Nintendo sold 4.54 million Switch 2 consoles.</p><p>To put that into context, that's more than double what the original Switch console sold within the same two-month time period (4.7 million units sold), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-year-1-sales-compared-ahead-of-wii-u-behind-ps4-and-more/1100-6500218/">and even more than what Sony managed with the PS4</a> (7.5 million units sold) and PS5 (7.8 million units sold) during its first two quarters. With the Switch 2 selling well, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo has now increased its hardware forecast</a> for the business year, as it predicts that it'll sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">up from its original estimate of 15 million</a>. If Nintendo reaches this number, that'll put Switch 2 sales far ahead of the original Switch, PS4, and PS5 consoles during their launch years.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As for its predecessor, the Switch has now reached 154.01 million units sold since 2017. This puts the Switch within spitting distance of the Nintendo DS, which sold 154.02 million units. Nintendo noted a 60% decline in Switch sales when compared to the same period in its previous fiscal year, but it is predicting that the console will dethrone the Nintendo DS by the end of its financial year and will cement itself as the company's best-selling console of all time.</p><p>In the games department, Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World has reached 9.57 million lifetime sales to date, and it is selling far better than its predecessor, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The game has a 92% attach rate, and around 8.1 million of these sales were from the Switch 2 hardware bundle that included the game. Donkey Kong Bananza has reached an impressive 3.49 million units sold since it launched in July, and the Switch 2 version of Mario Party Jamboree has hit 1.16 million units sold.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo has a strong lineup for the holiday season. This month will see the launch of Kirby Air Riders and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, while December will see the highly anticipated release of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p>

		<p>Nintendo’s latest quarterly report has revealed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has already sold more than 10 million consoles by the end of September, continuing its record-setting status as the fastest selling games console.</p>
<p>Having launched on 5th June, the Switch 2’s sales figures are split between the quarters ending on 30th June and 30th September. In its launch month alone, the Switch 2 raced to 5.82 million units sold, and this was followed by 4.54 million units through the rest of the summer. That puts the total at 10.36 million after four months, far outpacing the 7.8 million record of the PlayStation 5 through its first two quarters, and massively ahead of the original Switch. That console launched in early March 2017 and shipped 4.7 million through its first four months.</p>


<p>And here’s the thing. This 10 million consoles sold? That’s before the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> last month, which will absolutely have pushed many prospective Pokémon players to upgrade.</p>
<p>Instead, the main highlight games for the Switch 2 are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> which, thanks to being a console bundle game, enjoys a near 1:1 sales record at 9.57 million copies, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> at 3.49 million copies. A pretty good effort from DK, I’d say.</p>

<p>Indeed, while we heaped praise on the game for its excellent interactive documentary and wide selection of games in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">7/10 review</a>, we noted that the online functionality is simply not up to scratch at the moment.

<p>In fact, this latter issue appears to be so prevalent that some players over on PS5 have actually been awarded full refunds from Sony (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/sonys-allowing-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-refunds-because-the-ps5-ps4-compilation-is-a-downright-nightmare-for-some">Push Square</a>).

<p>Digital Eclipse is, however, working incredibly hard to resolve the issues that have arisen since launch. In fact, Head of Production Stephen Frost has been remarkably communicative over on X regarding player grievances, and recently stated that he is "running on fumes" in attempting to respond to all of the complaints.</p>

<p>The company has, however, confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-update-announced-here-are-the-patch-notes">a patch is already available on Steam</a>, with fixes addressing audio issues when playing online, missing audio from the 32X version of MKII, and more general stability. This patch is due to release on console at any moment.</p>
<p>Stephen Frost has also stated that more patches are due to go into testing imminently, so it seems crystal clear that the team is razor-focused on improving Legacy Kollection for players on all platforms. If you're not keen on diving in right now, we'd advise keeping your eye out for future updates – we're confident Digital Eclipse can stabilise things.</p>

In its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">latest earnings release</a>, covering April 1st to September 30th, Nintendo now predicts that it’ll sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, compared to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">previous forecast of 15 million</a>.</p><p>The Japanese gaming giant reports that 10.36 million Switch 2 consoles have been sold so far following its launch in June, with 4.54 million sales falling under its latest earnings period. 20.62 million Switch 2 games have also been sold since launch, though Nintendo has only raised its Switch 2 game forecast from 45 million to 48 million.</p><p>The combined hardware and software sales are driving a 110 percent surge in revenue, which increased to ¥1,099.5 billion (around $7.1 billion) between April and September, compared to ¥523.2 billion (around $3.4 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo also increased its end-of-year sales forecast to ¥2,250 billion (around $14.6 billion), and said it’s taken US tariff measures into consideration for these revisions.</p><p>While the Switch 2 is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console of all time</a>, the first Switch console is also still creeping up in sales. The Switch has now hit 154.01 million lifetime sales, <em>just shy</em> of the 154.02 million total units sold for the DS, which still reigns as Nintendo’s most successful console. After dethroning the DS, the Switch then just needs to surpass 160 million sales to become the best-selling console of all time — a record set by Sony’s PlayStation 2 last year.</p><p>By comparison, the Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime, a figure that the Switch 2 is pretty much guaranteed to surpass before its first birthday.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813025/nintendo-switch-2-sales-september-2025-earnings]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yo ho, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a>'s 1.3.0 update arrives today, November 4th.

<p>As outlined in the developer update video above, the "sweeping changes to individual civs" promised in the studio's last blog are mainly focused on delivering "significant buffs" to 12 nations a lot of folks play as. Axum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Sanghai, and Spain have all seen changes, with the newly renamed Achaemenid Persia rounding out the list.</p>
<p>These civs have gotten "more specific bonuses" aimed at ensuring they "lean into a unique play style" and making your starting position on the map factor more heavily into how your wider strategy plays out. For example, Egypt will now receive tailored bonuses for building settlements and districts along river tiles, better reflecting their historical reliance on the Nile," explained Civ creative director Ed Beach. "Achaemenid Persia will get far more culture benefits for the Pairidaeza unique improvement as well as additional happiness and culture from capturing settlements."</p><p>These sorts of changes extend into the update's fresh addition when it comes to sea and coastal tiles, with the Hawaii civ getting a head start on working with ocean tiles in the exploration age, rewarding using them to push in a watery direction from the get go.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the update overhauls the treasure fleet's interface via the addition of a "clear treasure point value" to help you tell how much the swag they're carrying is worth at a glance. Resource icon art has also had some distracting background colours toned down, so they should be easier on the eyes. Finally, selecting a scout will now see tiles with things to discover highlighted with a special blue and white outline, making it harder to miss things if you're leaning on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">auto-explore</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how these tweaks go down, as Civ 7 and devs Fiarxis continue along what's at times been a pretty rocky and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">saddening</a> post-release road.</p>

<p>Saints Row 1 Director has stated that he has been asked to create a pitch for a prequel instalment to the series, and it will not be a VR game. </p>



<p>The 2022 Saints Row reboot didn’t go down well with anyone, as most of the charm of the game was lost in this new version. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly generated $1.7 million</a> before Volition closed down, but it failed to meet fan expectations due to its lackluster narrative and shift in tone. However, it seems that all is not lost for the Saints Row franchise, as a new game is currently being pitched. </p>



<h2 id="h-saints-row-1-director-is-going-back-to-his-roots-with-the-prequel">Saints Row 1 Director is Going Back to His Roots With the Prequel</h2>



<p>The revelation about a Saints Row prequel pitch comes from the design director of the first title, Chris Stockman, latest post on the r/SaintsRow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/saints-row-1s-director-is-pitching-a-prequel-that-gets-back-to-the-roots-of-what-made-sr-1-entertaining-but-i-mostly-want-to-know-what-became-of-the-saints-row-2-pc-patch-whose-developer-died/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>). Titled, “I’ve been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row prequel!” Stockman’s post says he has hopeful news for the fans, as he has been approached “to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot.” He is unable to share any more information right now, but his “dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moreover, Stockman also stated that the prequel will not be a VR title, and he is returning to his roots. Sotckman added that he has a “very clear vision” for the prequel as he was the director of the first game. He also indulged in other conversations with players, explaining his vision for the title. </p>



<p>Stockman stated, “The core idea of Saints Row ’77 is to go back to the roots of what made SR 1 entertaining in the first place. It was somewhat grounded in reality but also a bit zany too. It had a lot more satirical elements vs. the later entries.” He added, or maybe they could “start in the 90s, then go 80s, then go 70s! Bookmark this reply. *wink wink*.” Whatever this ends up being, fans definitely seem excited about a prequel instalment to the series. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As is tradition for Sony, and for me writing about them, it’s time to take a look at the weird advert to sell PlayStations over the holiday season. This time there are three vignettes rather than one longer ad and as usual they do not feature any games, or indeed PlayStation consoles, instead, they sell an idea which this years is “anything can happen on PlayStation”.</p>
<p>The first advert is clearly influenced by Grand Theft Auto and finds a driver waking up in a truck which has landed somewhere unexpected.&nbsp; Unfortunately, YouTube still gives away exactly where that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="It Happens On PS5 - Stunt Jump" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woGbrJqimvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second advert is set on a fishing trawler which has landed a monstrous creature, but there is a twist in the tale that isn’t spoiled by YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="It Happens On PS5 – Unexpected Catch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uyYzIT7kNUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The third and final advert is just very odd. Two survivors from a wrecked spaceship spot a truck heading their way which is driven by an older woman and not much else happens.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="It Happens On PS5 – Crash Landings" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTi78EVDDJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sony usually pack these adverts with Easter eggs but I really cannot see that many this year. The truck in the first advert has the PS5 logo on the seat, and an Astro-bot badge can be seen, and the boat in the second advert also has the PS5 logo. The palm tree air freshener in the truck may be something but I cannot make any connection, and there is a wooden monster head at the back of the truck in the first head which again may be a reference, what do you think?</p>
<p>The adverts have rather more impact that last year’s effort which just features lots of people bouncing around for no reason.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiNPo7KvWCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc">&nbsp;one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened fourteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>

<p>As we'd expected, Sonic Frontiers is ahead of Superstars, likely due in part to the simple fact that it released much sooner, but we also believe that folks are generally more receptive to fully 3D titles these days. Indeed, Sega has previously stated that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/sega-reports-sluggish-sales-of-sonic-superstars-and-other-major-titles">sales for Superstars were "sluggish"</a>.</p>
<p>As for the specific figures, Sonic Frontiers sits at <strong>4.57 million units</strong>, while Sonic Superstars has shifted <strong>2.43 million units</strong>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is, for some reason, completely absent.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joizgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>We unfortunately don't get a look at what the platform split is for the sales data, but something tells us that the Switch is probably up there as the most popular console; at the very least, it'll be second to the PS5.</p>
<p>All in all, these certainly aren't bad figures, but it definitely puts into perspective that Nintendo's recent performance with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. The game, which launched back in July, has already shifted 3.49 million units, which compared to Frontiers and Superstars is kind of astonishing.</p>
<p>Still, we have nothing but love for the blue blur (even if we weren't particularly fond of Frontiers), so we hope Sega can shift even more units going forward. For racing fans, the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> will also be released soon, so keep your eye out for that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pillars-of-eternity-launches-turn-based-mode-beta-tomorrow.1342969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian announced that the cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a> will receive the fan-requested turn-based mode tomorrow. It will be a public beta going live on Steam and the Xbox PC app.</p>



<p>As you already know if you played the game, Pillars of Eternity is currently available only as a real-time with pause (RTwP) game, whereas its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadfire</a>, eventually introduced an optional turn-based mode. Fans had long requested this option in the first installment, and now Obsidian is delivering.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll have a number of settings to tweak in the new turn-based mode.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Josh Sawyer, the project director (also known for Fallout: New Vegas and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentiment</a>), who said:</p>



<p><em>There were a number of very reasonable criticisms of how the turn-based mode was implemented in Deadfire. Nick Carver and Jesse Bureno are trying to address those as well as they can. One of the major changes is that the action economy is a lot more accurate to the real time with pause game. It's not a 1:1 translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real time of pause mode. A lot of people commented that free actions felt abusable, which is true. That is now restricted and limited. That will feel like a significant change.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another criticism levied against the turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire was that it simply felt too slow. A fix for that was increased lethality, which Deadfire got through a mod and the first installment is now receiving by default straight from Obsidian. Lastly, it will be possible to switch from combat to combat between real-time with pause and turn-based modes. Of course, being a beta, issues are expected. Obsidian encouraged players to check out the beta and deliver their feedback ahead of the final release of the mode.</p>



<p>Even though Pillars of Eternity is now a pretty old game (it was released ten years ago), the addition of the turn-based mode, now preferred by most users to RTwP, could be enough to make some people go back and check it out, especially after the positive launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>, which is set in the same world.</p>



<p>A couple of years ago, Josh Sawyer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> he'd love to make Pillars of Eternity 3 with a Baldur's Gate 3-type budget. If that opportunity came along, he'd make it turn-based, so more experimentation feels like an interesting step toward that idea.</p>



<p>In other Obsidian news, the seemingly tireless studio has just released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another great RPG: The Outer Worlds 2</a>.</p>

That's not to say the devs haven't already been working to ensure "very reasonable criticisms" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>'s own turn-based mode, though, as outlined by director Josh Sawyer in the beta's announcement video.</p>

<p>"This has been a lot of work primarily from Nick Carver and Jesse Bureno," Sawyer said. "Special shout out to Kurt Decker, who's also been adding a lot of work of his own recently. This turn-based mode is something that we wanted to do because turn-based mode was received so well in Deadfire. That being said, there were a number of very reasonable criticisms of how turn-based mode was implemented in Deadfire. Nick and Jesse are trying to address those as well as they can."</p>
<p>Getting into specifics, you'll have the option to switch between turn-based mode and the standard real-time with pause combat at any point in your playthrough by heading into the options, rather than being locked to one system based on your choice at the start of the game. Obsidian are also "investigating" letting you toggle between the two via a button on the HUD, according to an announcement <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode">blog post</a>, but Sawyer makes it sound like this addition's already set in stone.</p><p>The number of turns you get per round is now tied to your character's speed and recovery stats, while the likes of swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions limited to one use per turn, in an effort to avoid them being "abusable". Finally, you should end up in less skirmishes which devolve into three hour long slogs, with combat lethality having been "significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful", mirroring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pillarsofeternity2/mods/43">popular Deadfire mods</a>.</p>
<p>As of right now, there's no set duration outlined for the beta, with Obsidian simply saying it'll "run for some time as we continue to roll out updates and prepare for a full release". We do at least know that the beta'll be available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/291650/Pillars_of_Eternity/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition/bs34vnw7h61f">Xbox app</a> players when it arrives tomorrow. There aren't any instructions in Obsidian's blog post, but it's probably safe to assume you'll be able to opt into it as you usually do Steam update betas on the former storefront. Xbox appers may have to press a special button that summons Phil Spencer or something.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is launching on November 14, 2025, as previously announced; there will be no early access for the title. </p>



<p>A few days ago, there was speculation that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign and Zombies modes would arrive a bit earlier than the multiplayer mode, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-load dates</a>. There were also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumours</a> about the game’s release being preponed by a week. However, all of these rumours about playing Black Ops 7 early have been debunked by Activision. </p>

<p>Reliable Call of Duty news source CharlieINTEL debunked the game’s early access rumors through a recent post on their official <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1985132037498433755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that Black Ops 7 releases on Friday, November 14. “There is no early access. There is no change to the release date.” An Activision representative confirmed these details to CharlieINTEL, so this should clear up all the confusion that players had. </p>

<p>For those wondering, Black Ops 7 will feature a co-op campaign mode at launch, where players will be able to visit a variety of different environments, “from the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast.” Coming to the multiplayer mode, players can start their BO7 journey with 16 6v6 maps and two 20v20 maps at launch. Lastly, round-based Zombies returns with the upcoming title as players descend into the heart of the Dark Aether. </p>

            <p>Arc Raiders players are getting free in-game currency following server problems earlier this week. These problems were caused by an influx of players that broke launch-day figures.</p>
<p>In a post on the Arc Raiders Discord server, Embark Studios community lead Ossen Julia stated: "Our team is working with determination to get you into those shuttles in a timely manner and we thank you for your patience while we're fine-tuning the system. To show our appreciation, we're sending you 500 Raider Tokens to use as you see fit."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem">Arc Raiders launched to a whopping 130,000+ concurrent Steam players</a> on its release day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">growing even larger the following day</a>. However, days later it reached a new peak of 354,836 concurrent players over the weekend, showing strong momentum and word of mouth for the extraction shooter.</p>

<p>It's not the only favour Embark Studios has been doing for suffering players.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raider-is-committed-to-skill-and-fun-not-unfair-advantages-and-is-refunding-gear-lost-to-cheaters-even-if-you-didnt-report-them"> Those who have been killed by cheaters have been getting their lost loot sent back to them</a>, with the developers stating they're: "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages". This happened to me just this morning, and I've got to say, it does feel rather good to have an unfair death reversed.</p><p>If you've not played Arc Raiders yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">why not check out Eurogamer's preview</a>! In it, the game is described as such: "It's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p>Nintendo's latest financials are out and while the focus is on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-its-first-few-months-on-sale-switch-2-outpaced-the-ps4-the-ps5-and-the-original-switch-and-nintendo-only-expects-things-to-get-better">how well Nintendo's newest console, the Switch 2, has performed</a>, it's the older generation machine that's a hair's breadth from reaching a staggering milestone for the company: becoming Nintendo's best-selling games machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Sales data for the period ending 30th September 2025</a> shows Nintendo Switch is around 10,000 sales from levelling the colossal lifetime record set by Nintendo DS. The DS has 154.02m sales and the Switch has 154.01m - it's neck and neck. And given that the Switch is still actively selling in notable quantities, it's a record this industry-shaping hybrid handheld console looks set to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">The full-year sales forecast for Nintendo Switch</a> is 4m units, incidentally, and there are two more sales quarters to go.</p>
<p>For reference, the Nintendo Wii - another champion seller for Nintendo - sold 101.63m units during its lifetime, which gives you an idea of the enormity of Switch's success. The Wii U, meanwhile, sold a woeful 14.56m units.</p>
<p>But there's still a bigger fish in the proverbial pond when it comes to lifetime console sales, and that is, of course, PlayStation 2. Sony's best-selling machine is the record-holder, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-officially-surpasses-160m-sales-retaining-its-best-selling-console-crown">the PS2 surpassing 160m sales last autumn</a>. But that tally is not out of reach for Nintendo's Switch should the sales keep trickling in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Two NetEase-funded companies founded by MMO veterans, T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle, shared the fate of losing NetEase's support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just like many other studios</a>. Both have scrambled to find alternate publishers and ways to stay alive, and now, they have two announcements - one of hope and another of (almost) defeat.</p>



<p>T-Minus Zero <a href="https://www.t-minuszero-relaunch.com/tm0-news/t-minus-zero-relaunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in a press release</a> that a small group of veteran directors and founders has decided to acquire the studio name to carry the team's spirit forward, and they are relaunching as an independent production company. The studio now aims to create high-quality gaming experiences that bring people together with a close-knit team of veteran technical and creative leaders who work exceptionally well together. T-Minus Zero also claims to already possess a 'genre-forward concept' with substantial proof of interest and scalability across platforms.</p>



<p>Zachary Beaudoin, the new CEO, stated that the team is now seeking co-financing partners for T-Minus Zero's next round of development financing. Beaudoin previously worked at BioWare, Blizzard, and Crystal Dynamics.</p>



<p>As for Fantastic Pixel Castle, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmo-fantastic-pixel-castle-is-in-danger-netease-pulls-plug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we already knew the studio was in serious trouble</a>. Yesterday, founder Greg Street <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in a LinkedIn post that the studio now has a closure date: November 17. There is a chance the studio might still secure funding for its Ghost MMO after this date, but by then, the priority will be to help team members find employment.</p>



<p>I had interviewed both <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Street</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-qa-neteases-latest-aaa-team-plans-ambitious-things-never-before-seen-in-online-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Vogel</a> (the original founder of T-Minus Zero) back in 2023 when NetEase established the respective studios. Street was a key figure at Blizzard on World of Warcraft and later at Riot Games on League of Legends and the League of Legends MMO <a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was eventually rebooted last year</a>. Rich Vogel, on the other hand, had worked on Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is currently unclear whether he'll stay after the studio's reboot.</p>

<p>All in all, there's not a whole lot to report on with the OG Switch. The numbers are all gradually going up, but there are no changes to the overall order. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is just shy of 70 million units sold now, so we fully expect the game to hit this for the next financial release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> has bumped itself over the 22 million mark, which is a fantastic achievement for a sequel. You might wonder, in fact, why both this and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> didn't see an even bigger jump, considering both received Switch 2 Editions. Well, the reason is simple: Nintendo has stated that Upgrade Packs don't count toward total software sales, so there you go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joizgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> its quarterly and half-year results for 2025, covering the period from April to September, and revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 is already outselling its predecessor.</p>



<p>As of September 30, the new hybrid handheld console has sold 10.36 million units, significantly outpacing the original Switch (which took about ten months to sell a similar amount of units). When it comes to Nintendo Switch 2 software sales, they have reached 20.62 million units, meaning that there's an average of nearly two Switch 2 games per unit.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, the big launch exclusive, predictably secured the lion's share of the software sales, selling 9.57 million units. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> also sold pretty well, achieving 3.49 million units from July to September.</p>



<p>In light of these promising results, Nintendo has revised its previous conservative forecast of 15 million units sold by the end of the fiscal year (March 2026). It now forecasts 19 million Nintendo Switch 2 units sold in the console's first year on the market. If achieved, it will be all the more remarkable because it happened under the shadow of the US tariffs. For example, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously revised its original 17 million units forecast down to 15 million</a> specifically due to that ongoing issue.</p>



<p>During the reported timeframe, the original Nintendo Switch sold 1.89 million hardware units and 61.56 million software units. The full-year forecast for the older console was slightly reduced from 4.5 million units to 4 million, although software units are now estimated to reach 125 million copies, up from the 105 million copies of the previous forecast. Overall, the Nintendo Switch has sold 154 million units since its launch in March 2017. At this rate, it seems unlikely it will ever reach the 160.6 million units sold by Sony's PlayStation 2, the best-selling console of all time, but it probably doesn't matter that much to Nintendo.</p>

<p>Sentinels have announced they are exiting Marvel Rivals Esports, though the door has been left open for a return in the future.</p>



<p>The team competed in the inaugural Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals in China, but, as preparations start to prepare for the end-of-season Ignite tournament, expected to take place next month, Sentinels announced they are exiting the competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-leaving-marvel-rivals-esports">Sentinels Leaving Marvel Rivals Esports</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Departure. Image via Sentinels</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/senrivals/status/1985492677669110241?s=46&amp;t=SjOb542MOiUY8kbKILY2Og" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Sentinels stated they were “pausing” operations in Marvel Rivals, but they would “revisit the decision” if NetEase were to roll out a program with team incentives.</p>



<p>It’s added that all players in the team are “now free to explore new opportunities,” with those who were on the team now available to sign for another organisation.</p>



<p>The stance from Sentinels aligns with what the organisation’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-ceo-says-marvel-rivals-team-bundles-are-critical-for-esports-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CEO Rob Moore told Insider Gaming</a> at the Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals, where he described the introduction of purchasable team bundles as “critical” for the future of the title in the Esports scene.</p>



<p>NetEase is yet to announce any decision regarding bundles, though <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Tournament lead Adam H</a>uang did state that skin bundles could be added in the future, which could contribute to the prize pools of the grand finals.</p>



<p>Similar incentives are commonplace across other Esports, helping to establish the economics of the scene, and it remains to be seen whether NetEase will introduce a similar stance.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for comment on the Sentinels exit from the Esports scene and whether team incentives are being planned.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has increased its sales forecast for its recently debuted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console ahead of the festive season.</p>
<p>"The full-year sales unit forecast for Nintendo Switch 2 hardware has been increased by 4m units to 19m units, and software by 3m units to 48m units," the company wrote in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">most recent financial report</a>.</p>
<p>As of 30th September 2025, the Switch 2 has sold 10.36m units, Nintendo revealed. This means the company has shifted a total of 4.54m Switch 2 hardware units during the three months ending 30th September of this year. To put that into perspective, 4.54m sales in the second quarter is unmatched by any other console.

<p>"Additionally, the forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware has been decreased by 0.50m units to 4m units, and software has been increased by 20m units to 125m units," the company continued.</p>
<p>The original Switch, which first released back in 2017, has sold a total 154.01m units as of 30th September. According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">latest financial reports</a>, Nintendo's best selling console thus far remains Nintendo DS, but only by an actual smidge. The DS as of September has sold 154.02m units. It seems more than likely that the Switch will usurp the DS in terms of sales by the next reporting period.</p>

<p>If you compare this to other consoles in the same launch time, you can see just how impressive these stats are: the PS4 managed 7.5m in the same timeframe, with the PS5 achieving 7.8m, and the original Switch shifting just under 5m (4.7m, to be precise).</p><p>Looking ahead to full 12-month figures, Nintendo's target of 19m Switch 2 sales will put the new console comfortably ahead of the original Switch (which managed just over 14m), the PS4 (clocking in at 13.5m), and the PS5 (which had a peculiarly similar trajectory to its predecessor at 13.4m).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, earlier this week it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">a trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be attached to screenings of Wicked: For Good</a>, which is set to release on 21st November. Some have since started speculating that Rosalina, should she appear in the upcoming sequel, will be voiced by Ariana Grande, who stars and Glinda the Good in the Wicked film adaptations.</p>

<p>Only 10,000 units separate it from the DS</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="104c3f1734b63"><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/104c3f1734b63/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been positively <em>itching</em> to see the latest financial report from Nintendo, as we had expected the Switch to finally surpass the Nintendo DS and become the company's best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Alas, that hasn't quite happened yet. At <strong>154.01 million units</strong>, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Switch is a mere 10,000 units away from the DS</a>, and considering the data is only viable to the end of September 2025, it's likely that the gap has already been closed in the couple of months following.</p>
<p>We don't <em>know</em> that though, so we just have to assume for now that the DS is still in the lead.</p>
<p>Still, what a remarkable feat by the Switch! And let's not forget that the console commands the most software sales by a <em>huge</em> margin, shifting a total of <strong>1,452.79 million units</strong>. DS, meanwhile, managed <strong>948.76 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the Switch 2, which has now sold a total of <strong>10.36 million units</strong> after just 4 months on the market, it's only 3.2 million units away from surpassing the Wii U - <em>mad</em>.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at where things stand at the moment:</p>

Otherwise, this is a pretty solid look at the immediate future, and while much of it is still made up of Switch 2 Editions (yes, including Prime 4 itself), there are also a bunch of completely new titles for the new console.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joizgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Quite the line-up, huh? Nintendo notes that release dates are subject to change, while also clarifying that Hyrule Warriors is only a Nintendo product outside of Japan (Koei Tecmo is handling publishing duties in the country). Pokémon Pokopia, meanwhile, will be published by The Pokémon Company in Japan.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it will start delisting Football Manager 2024 from storefronts, and the process will begin on November 5th. The reason for the delisting is the end of license agreements and new ones likely being agreed for Football Manager 26. There does not seem to be any kind of discount for Football Manager 2024 ahead of its delisting. The dates for the delistings are below.</p>



<p>As you can see from the table, Football Manager 2024 will be delisted tomorrow from Steam and the Epic Games Store, including the demo. Then on November 16th the game will be removed from Windows Store, PC Game Pass, Xbox consoles, and Xbox Game Pass. On 18th November, Football Manager 2024 will be removed from PS5’s store, and on December 5th Football Manager 2024 Touch will be removed from the Nintendo Switch Store. Those playing FM24 Touch on Apple Arcade and FM24 Mobile via Netflix will be able to upgrade to Football Manager 26.</p>

<p>In our Football Manager 2024 review I wrote, “There’s a lot of depth to Football Manager 2024, but how deep you go is up to you. You can sit back and just focus on the basics of the match day and transfers, or you can all the way to managing individual player training and using the new player targets feature Whatever approach you choose, Football Manager 2024 offers a near full package to start or continue your managerial career.”</p>

<figure data-uuid="9cd0e499927a1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cd0e499927a1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">financial data</a> for the six months ending <strong>30th September 2025</strong>, and has provided updated sales figures for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The console has now sold at least <strong>10.36 million units</strong> according to the official figures, which is seemingly more than even Nintendo itself was anticipating. As such, the company has increased its forecast for the year, bumping expected Switch 2 sales up from <strong>15 million</strong> to <strong>19 million</strong>. Switch 2 software has seen a similar jump up from <strong>45 million</strong> to <strong>48 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Naturally, this also means that sales for the original Switch family of systems have tanked, with the console pulling in a meagre <strong>1.89 million</strong> in sales, a hefty drop of 60% year-on-year. As a result, Nintendo has decreased its forecast for the Switch accordingly, lowering console sales from <strong>4.5 million</strong> to <strong>4 million</strong>. On the flip side, however, thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility, the software forecast has been increased from <strong>105 million</strong> to <strong>125 million;</strong> a bump of 19%.</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the Switch 2 has sold across various regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Americas - 3.68m</li>
<li>Europe - 2.40m</li>
<li>Japan - 2.35m</li>
<li>Other - 1.93m</li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of bundles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold an extraordinary amount, shifting a total of <strong>9.57 million</strong> <strong>units</strong> since launch – a remarkable attach rate of over 92%. Meanwhile, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold <strong>3.49 million units</strong>, which perhaps isn't as high as fans would have hoped for. Still, it's a good start nevertheless.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that a total of <strong>20.62 million software units</strong> for the Switch 2 have been sold since launch, of which approximately <strong>8.10 million</strong> were bundled with the console itself.</p>
<p>A pretty solid start for the Switch 2, then! As expected, this also means that gross profit also saw a nice little bump for the company, "rising 25.3% year-on-year to 398.4 billion yen". It's also increased its financial forecasts for the year, including net sales to 2,250.0 billion yen and operating profit to 370.0 billion yen.</p>
