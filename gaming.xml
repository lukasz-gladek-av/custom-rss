            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Close to one year on from the launch of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">Cloud Streaming beta</a> for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, Sony has announced the official launch of this feature, as well as the debut of being able to stream your own games. All you need is a PS Portal and an active PlayStation Plus Premium subscription.</p>
<p>The update will arrive overnight tonight at 2AM on 6th November GMT, or 6PM 5th November on the US West Coast.</p>


<p>Cloud Streaming of your own games lets you stream from Sony’s servers instead of using Remote Play with your console. This has been shown to have some better performance, which seems daft in certain situations, but comes down to the server architecture having been optimised specifically for streaming. By incorporating your digitally owned games into this, it means titles such as Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, and Resident Evil 4, which are not in the PS Plus library can be streamed.</p>
<p>The announcement notes that this can open up new multiplayer possibilities, such as having another player on your PS5, while you stream from the cloud. It also makes the experience of using the PS Portal away from home better and more reliable – no more remembering to leave your PS5 in standby or telling other family members not to use it.</p>
<p>For a full list of streamable games, visit <a href="http://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming">here,</a> where Sony has constructed a really annoying layout with a search bar, instead of just making a list.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the system software of the PS Portal has been given an overhaul.</p>
<p>The refreshed UI presents three options when booting up – remote play, cloud streaming and a cloud streaming search – and cloud streaming now has a dedicated UI. There’s also 3D audio support for streamed games, a passcode lock, and a network status screen for finding a good connection. When you’re in a game, the in-game stores now work, there’s better accessibility options specifically for when streaming games, and game invitations arrive on a system level as well.</p>
<p>All around, this seems like a great update, so long as you have a PS Plus Premium subscription.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps-portal-cloud-streaming-out-of-beta-live-for-ps-plus-premium-users/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cloud-streaming-on-ps-portal-finally-out-of-beta-officially-live-for-all-ps-plus-premium-users.1344343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in November 2024, a year after the PlayStation Portal first launched in November 2023, PlayStation pushed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">Cloud Streaming Beta in a firmware update</a>. Now, yet another year later, a device that everyone would have understandably assumed would support Cloud Streaming from launch (but for some reason did not) now has official Cloud Streaming support, as PlayStation confirmed today that streaming your digital library of games already compatible with streaming is now available to all PS Portal users who are also subscribed to PS Plus Premium.</p>



<p>A new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">PlayStation Blog</a> goes through the features that PS Portal owners can now take advantage of, and the many caveats around cloud streaming on your device. Those caveats being that you can only use cloud streaming if you are subscribed to PS Plus Premium, which as a reminder is the highest of the three PS Plus tiers.</p>



<p>You can also only use it for a select number of digital games in your library. Not every game you have may be available for cloud streaming, as that availability can differ based on region. That said, there are thousands of games available to be streamed, so while <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">you can check out this list of games available for cloud streaming here</a>, chances are what you're looking for is up to be played over streaming.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cloud Streaming for PS5 games on PlayStation Portal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPgBMPkWXeg?start=3&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Along with the feature exiting its beta stage, users who have been testing out the beta will see a few changes. Firstly, for all PS Portal users, today's update offers a new remote play home screen. There's also a new home screen for when you're on the page to play your games over streaming. The search screen now also helps you identify if a game is available to be played over streaming.</p>



<p>Remote play and cloud streaming users also now get full 3D audio support, and there's a new network status screen to help you better gauge your internet connection strength if you happen to be experiencing issues while playing. Also, if you're concerned about someone using your PS Portal when you're not, you can now add a passcode lock to your device.</p>



<p>Regarding cloud streaming-specific updates, you can now access accessibility options like screen readers and adjusting the size of the text on screen, game invitations will work properly while playing a game over streaming, and you can make in-game purchases while streaming your games.</p>



<p>It's a good day for PS Portal users who have been waiting for this to be official, but it feels worth noting that it is almost insane to see a feature that should have come with the device only officially arrive two years after it has been on shelves. </p>



<p>Not that PlayStation doesn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-system-update-adds-support-for-basic-features-like-game-captures-to-cloud-streaming/">already have a history of adding basic features to the Portal late in the game</a>, but when the news of cloud streaming exiting beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-leak-suggests-highly-requested-feature-is-coming-soon/">PS Portal leaked just a week earlier</a>, you'd be forgiven if your reaction was one of complete surprise that it wasn't there at launch.</p>



<p>At least it's here now, and as senior manager in product management at Sony, Takuro Fushimi, says in his PlayStation Blog post, we can "<em>look forward</em>" to PlayStation "<em>sharing more updates in the future</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epic and Google Look Set to Bury the Fortnite Hatchet Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-fortnite-joint-proposal</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-and-google-look-set-to-bury-the-fortnite-hatchet-soon.1344340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic's Tim Sweeney has revealed that Google has made what he calls an "awesome" proposal to open up the Android operating system, thus setting the stage for a potential burying of the hatchet (if you'll forgive the mixed metaphors).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a> earlier today, Sweeney said the proposal would "double down on Android's original vision as an open platform" by streamlining "competing store installs", reducing developer service fees on the Play Store, and enabling third-party "in-app and web payments".</p>

<p>Sweeney goes on to describe this proposal as a "comprehensive solution" which he contrasts against Apple's "model of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">blocking all competing stores</a> and leaving payments as the only vector for competition".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-epic-apple-proposal-tim-sweeney.jpg?itok=0lTmU7AU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-epic-apple-proposal-tim-sweeney.jpg?itok=bYx_7HKU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic's long battle with Google could be over soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Google's Sameer Samat, president of the Android ecosystem, <a href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">echoes</a> Sweeney's comments. He says the proposal is aimed at "expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe".</p>

<p>Samat goes as far as to say that if the proposal is approved in court, it would "resolve [Epic and Google's] litigations", so if the proposal goes through, it'll mark an end to the protracted legal battle that began all those years ago.</p>

<p>Epic and Google's battle started in 2020, when&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">removed from the Play Store</a>&nbsp;after Epic attempted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">bypass Android's proprietary payment system</a> in order to offer direct discounts on several in-game purchases.</p>

<p>In response, Epic sued Google (as well as Apple, who took similar measures), leading to a lengthy court battle in which Epic accused both companies of holding a mobile duopoly and discouraging competition.</p>




<p>The proposals must now be approved by US District Judge James Donato, who's presiding over the Epic vs. Google case. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-proposes-app-store-reforms-settlement-with-fortnite-maker-epic-games-2025-11-05/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, Donato is scheduled to meet with lawyers for "a previously scheduled hearing" tomorrow, so the new proposals may be discussed then. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Effectively a DualSense controller with a screen in the middle, the handheld lets you stream your PlayStation 5 to it if you’ve got good wifi, but it’s mostly just an extension of the console itself. Well, not anymore. Sony has announced that the PlayStation Portal will finally be able to stream games directly rather than needing them to bounce off your console.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on the </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/"><span>PlayStation Blog</span></a><span>, Sony announced that if you’re subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium, you’ll be able to stream </span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/"><span>cloud-streaming-compatible PS5 games</span></a><span> directly to your Portal instead of having them ping back and forth between your console and the handheld. The feature will go live tonight, November 5, at 6 p.m. Pacific Time. Sony still recommends you play on internet speeds of at least 15 megabytes per second, which might not sound like much until you’ve lived in the boonies and dealt with service providers only offering 3 megabytes per second in your area, forcing you to take your game devices to other people’s houses or your college campus to download patches. So if you’re considering grabbing the Portal to make cloud streaming your way of playing, make sure your router’s got the juice.</span></p>

  <p><span>This update is part of a wider revamp of the Portal’s systems, which includes a new UI, 3D audio support, and some smaller added functions like passcode support.</span></p> <p><span>I’ve considered buying a Portal in the past as a way to play my PS5 games in bed, but I will always be sad that PlayStation hasn’t invested in a dedicated handheld device since the PlayStation Vita.

              <p>“It’s important to realize that we’re really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we’re taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that.” That’s how PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst described Sony’s approach to porting its first-party exclusives to PC <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html">earlier this year</a>. But recently discovered references to PC gaming and a possible “cross-buy” feature on the PlayStation 5 storefront have some wondering if the company’s about to do something more bold <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">when its PS6 console lineup</a> arrives in the not-too-distant future.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860">dataminer Amethxst</a> (<a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1986037256205766714">and corroborated</a> <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1985795788895580232">by others</a>), new symbols have recently been added to the PlayStation Store backend for PS5. One is a shared “PS5/PC” icon and the other reads “Cross-Buy.” They add that the new symbols use official Sony fonts and aren’t found on PS4. While these new icons aren’t yet proof of anything, they suggest Sony is exploring new features that would expand the PlayStation ecosystem beyond a single console, much like Microsoft has been doing with its “Play Anywhere” initiative and recent movement into PC gaming handhelds with the full-screen Windows gaming experience for the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I didn't think this and <a href="https://twitter.com/Zuby_Tech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Zuby_Tech</a>'s post would go viral, so:<br>– The screen is real (see video below)<br>– The symbols are present on PS5 (not PS4)<br>– The symbols are official Sony 'fonts' (uf-code: EF5B to EF61)</p> <p>You can see them yourself by searching for my ID: yAmethxst <a href="https://t.co/abU35ihfHG">https://t.co/abU35ihfHG</a> <a href="https://t.co/xz6e5u14v6">pic.twitter.com/xz6e5u14v6</a></p> <p>— Amethxst (@yAmethxst) <a href="https://twitter.com/yAmethxst/status/1985841552288104906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One thing we do know is that Sony has been exploring how to expand its reach into PC gaming for years by bringing its biggest blockbusters to Steam and the Epic Games Store. That effort began with <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in 2021 and has seen major PS5 exclusives like <em>Spider-Man 2</em> arrive on PC in as little as 15 months after the console version released. At that pace, <em>Astro Bo</em>t should arrive by early next year. But Sony has stopped short of going full day-and-date on PC with its releases, outside of online multiplayer games like <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>Sony’s rumored PlayStation PC launcher</h2> <p>It’s also struggled to navigate how to bring those games to another platform while still getting new players to join its existing PlayStation Network service. Sony has added trophy support and other features to Steam versions of games like <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> but has also faced backlash over PSN login requirements for even its single-player blockbusters. It’s a tricky tightrope to walk that comes with obvious downsides for Sony, the most significant of which is that other companies get a cut of the sales when PlayStation games are sold on PC.</p>

 <p>One obvious solution to that problem would be a full-blown PlayStation PC launcher like Ubisoft and other third-party publishers have. Indeed, Sony <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/now-reference-to-a-playstation-pc-launcher-has-been-discovered-in-spider-man-pc/">was reportedly exploring exactly that</a>&nbsp;based on references found in the files for <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em>. While the company eventually opted to integrate PSN directly into the Steam versions of games, the newly discovered references to “PS5/PC” and “Cross-Buy” make it seem like a bespoke PlayStation PC launcher might still be on the table.</p>

 <p>A PC launcher seems like the most obvious way that Sony could allow players to purchase a game like <em>God of War</em> on console and then redeem the PC version of it at no extra cost, or vice versa. Microsoft’s “Play Anywhere” initiative works similarly. Buying <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>&nbsp;on Xbox Series X doesn’t qualify you for the Steam version of the game but it does get you access to the Windows version, because Microsoft owns that storefront and has worked out the licensing agreements with third-party publishers.</p>

 <h2>The new platform wars</h2> <p>But this isn’t the first time Sony has supported “Cross-Buy” in the PlayStation ecosystem, and these new references could also be hinting at potential plans for the company’s rumored handheld. A big selling point of the PlayStation Vita back in the day was that some games only had to be purchased once to play them across both the portable and PS3. One of those was the original <em>Helldivers</em>. It was a neat idea that abruptly ended thanks to the Vita’s quick demise.</p>

 <p>A new high-end gaming handheld that approaches the power of a PlayStation 5, however, would bring “Cross-Buy” back in a big way. There are two interesting possibilities here. The first and most expected is that Sony’s rumored next-gen handheld would have access to all of the games players already have in the PS5 and PS4 libraries. But “Cross-Buy” would also give players coming from PC who are otherwise new to the PlayStation console ecosystem a better foothold if their existing Sony purchases can be redeemed across both platforms.</p> <p>Or maybe Sony is exploring a more hybrid PC gaming handheld approach in the vein of the Xbox Ally X. It’s easy to speculate but hard to say with no concrete info to go on. The most interesting takeaway, however, is that Microsoft’s recent moves might be forcing Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-pc-mobile-streaming-leak-more-subscriptions/">to compete in unexpected ways</a>. The tech giant might be retreating from the traditional console hardware market, but its wider platform initiatives could still be pushing PlayStation to offer players better features in the future.</p>

                <p>PlayStation Portal owners can now stream their games from the cloud, Sony has announced. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-adds-more-features-to-cloud-streaming/1100-6530723/">After rolling out a beta version last year</a>, the updated version of Cloud Streaming will allow PS Plus Premium members to play a massively expanded selection of games on the device, and it won't require them to connect to a PS5 console through Remote Play.</p><p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">there are 2,845 games that support PS Portal Cloud Streaming</a>. This includes several of Sony's biggest first-party titles like Ghost of Yotei and Astro Bot, alongside third-party titles like Borderlands 4 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Games from the PS Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog are compatible as well, and Sony has introduced a new home screen that features three tabs to help distinguish between the various modes: Remote Play, Cloud Streaming, and Search.</p><p>Remote Play requires a PS5 console paired to a PS Portal so that installed games can be streamed directly from the system onto the handheld. This mode doesn't require a PS Plus Premium membership, but Cloud Streaming does. The search option will let users look up any game that supports Cloud Streaming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596866" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596866"></a><figcaption>A closer look at new PS Portal features.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596867,1300-4596868,1300-4596869" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg"></figure><p>Other new features being introduced for both Remote Play and Cloud Streaming include 3D audio support when using a compatible audio device like the Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, a passcode lock screen, and a network status screen so that PS Portal owners can quickly check the quality of their connection.</p><p>The new features that'll be unique for the Cloud Streaming functions are updated accessibility options, an in-game store that supports in-game purchases during a game stream, and game invites from friends who are playing the same game.</p><p>Sony launched the PS Portal in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/">and while the device was a tough recommendation due to its limited use-case</a>, critics and users did note that it was still a well-designed piece of hardware.

            <p>Today, Sony will officially push out one of the biggest PS Portal updates the peculiar little handheld has received since it was first released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">back in November 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This update, which has been in beta for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">about a year</a>, will allow anyone that owns the machine to use Cloud Streaming via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> - effectively meaning you can bypass needing a PS5 console <strong>at all</strong> in order to play the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, and many more (thousands more, in fact, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">per PlayStation itself</a>).</p>
<p>So, why is this a big deal? Since its launch in 2023, the £200 device (always sold as 'a PS5 peripheral' rather than a standalone, game-ready device) sold itself mainly on the fact you could stream from your home console directly to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house.</p>
<p>It's always felt a bit limited, or niche, especially for that costly outlay, but Sony's latest update makes good on its 2024 promise to let you play PS5 games without a central console acting as a hub. It's a little convoluted to set this up, but it can be done. </p>

</figure>
<p>If you own a PS Portal, sign into the machine with your PS Plus account (you must have Premium in order to access Game Streaming). Go to the PS Portal settings, and find the option to turn on Game Streaming - currently, still, with the Beta label. Switch it on, and sign back in with your account. At the boot screen, you will be able to access your home PS5 or a separate streaming tab. This will work even if you don't have a PS5 attached to the PS Portal. 
</p><p>These titles act, to all intents and purposes like 'real' installed games: as of today's update, in-game purchases will be supported, and you can purchase add-on items and in-game currencies without leaving your game session, you will have access to 3D Audio, and you can play in online sessions (though you might want to be mindful of the slight lag).</p>

<figcaption>The real purpose of game streaming. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in the image above, I can play Tekken 3 on the PS Portal without having the game installed on my actual PS5. I could play this - or Astro Bot, or anything from my library or viable game via PlayStation Plus - in the same way. No matter how powerful the title.</p>
<p>Is this going to make me sell my PS5? No, of course not. But I'm going to get far more use out of my Portal, I can tell you that for free: this job has me travelling a fair amount, and sometimes when staying with family or one of my partners, I sometimes have a few hours of downtime. Relying on home and public WiFi connections in order to remote play has always been spotty, but if the Portal can stream effectively from, say, a coffee shop hotspot, the idea of playing Monster Hunter Wilds in a town centre is pretty compelling.</p><p>I'll do a proper test of this from a GP's office tomorrow morning - when the update for the full-fat version of game streaming is actually live - and report back. But, with this one update, suddenly the appeal (and price!) of a PS Portal starts to make sense.</p>
<p>A full list of compatible games via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog<a href="http://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming">is available here</a>. The full update goes live on 5th November at 6pm PT / 6th November at 2am GMT.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> saw a surge of players with the new Simpsons' themed season, which according to Epic Games hasn't been seen since the last holiday season.</p>
<p>The Simpsons season of Fortnite - which brought with it a new map, Simpsons' themed cosmetics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-getting-pets-at-last-including-a-banana-puppy-you-can-dance-with">as well as the Sidekicks</a> (little pets that follow you around) - was released on the 1st November. Since then, it seems as though an absurd amount of players have been keen to explore Springfield across both the Battle Royale and Delulu modes.</p>
<p>In addition, the first Fortnite x Simpsons short that was released on Disney + reached the number 1 spot on Disney Plus, which is certainly a feat. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-all-know-that-the-simpsons-has-come-to-fortnite-but-did-you-know-that-fornite-has-also-come-to-the-latest-episode-of-the-simpsons">The latest episode of The Simpsons also had the Fortnite characters present in its opening coach gag</a>, which I'm sure was a cool surprise for a number of viewers.</p>

<p>Look, we may be a little tired of multi-media crossovers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-hate-the-ready-player-one-ification-of-all-our-favourite-media-but-cant-resist-the-simpsons-in-fortnite">but it turns out this Simpsons crossover has proven a touch irresistible to </a><a href="http://many.it/">many</a>. It appears as though The Simpsons strikes some sort of Achilles’ heel among 30-something pop culture fiends. I, for one, cannot wait for the future Friends crossover that I'm sure will annihilate hordes of city-loving IPA lovers. Me. It'll take out me.</p>

<p>The original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped">Biped</a> was a charming little co-op adventure that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/biped">we rather enjoyed</a> here at Nintendo Life, and now its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped_2">Biped 2</a>, is out now on Switch.</p>
<p>With support for both online and local multiplayer, friends will need to partner up to complete intriguing physics-based puzzles. The game features improved mechanics and smoother controls, loads more customisation options, new biomes, and more.</p>
<p>The trailer above showcases some really cool modes, with both co-op and competitive play available, and we just love how manic and quirky it all is. If you're unfamiliar with the general premise, the characters are controller by moving the analogue sticks to ambulate their legs separately. It makes for some tricky puzzle-solving and hilarious slapstick gameplay. We can't wait to dive in.</p>
<p>So let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Team Up!:</strong> Play as charming bipedal robots, Aku and Sila, who you may recognize from the first game, and two new adorable characters, who rely on each other and embark on incredible adventures side by side.</p>
<p><strong>New Mechanics:</strong> Try out new movement types that are smoothly integrated into the game process. Soar gracefully on a hang glider and leave beautiful patterns behind, or conquer ledges and breaks with a grappling hook!</p>
<p><strong>Explore New Biomes:</strong> Unravel the mysteries of an alien planet and meet new characters, even elementals. Explore unfamiliar environments and be ready to face the challenges that they might bring tailored specifically to the corresponding game modes: solo, two or four player playthrough.</p>
<p><strong>Customize Your Bot:</strong> Dress up your bipeds for the occasion to impress your new friends. Collect treasures and buy wacky hats. Be unique, or choose pair looks with your partner.</p>
<p><strong>Build Your Own:</strong> Use Steam Workshop to create your own levels! Share them with the community and check others’ creations as well! The possibilities are limitless, and nothing can stop you on your way to having even more fun!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biped 2 is available now via the Switch eShop for <strong>£16.75 / $19.99</strong>.</p>

Five years after exclusively launching in Japan as the “<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nintendo-launches-my-nintendo-app-japan/">My Nintendo</a>” app, Nintendo has now expanded the iOS and Android experience under a new name to other regions, including the US, UK, Canada, and most of Europe.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">App Store</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.znej" rel="sponsored">Play Store</a> listings, the Nintendo Store app allows users to browse and purchase Switch 2 and Switch consoles, hardware accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo merchandise.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-are-editing-game-files-to-turn-off-matchmaking-against-%E2%80%98overpowered%E2%80%99-aim-assist.1344283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 players on PC have found a way to edit the game files to disable crossplay and prevent them from being matchmade with players using a controller, which is said to have ‘overpowered’ aim assist.</p>



<p>It’s a tale as old as time, where keyboard-and-mouse players feel at a disadvantage against controller players because of the aim assist developers add for controller players. In reality, aim assist is traditionally added for controller players in first-person shooters because keyboard and mouse offer more precise aiming. However, in recent years, keyboard and mouse players have felt that developers have incorporated aim assist too much, resulting in controller players now having a far greater advantage than those playing with keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>The theory has led one player to discover that you can actually remove crossplay with controller players from the game files on PC For those who currently don’t have Battlefield 6 on PC, you can <a target="_blank" title="Battlefield 6 - Loaded (PC)" href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/" data-shortcode="true">buy it here for the cheapest price</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-disable-crossplay-with-battlefield-6-controller-players">How to Disable Crossplay with Battlefield 6 Controller Players</h2>



<p>First posted online by the X account <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ottr</a>, players can go into the game files at documents/battlefield 6/settings/steam/PROFSAVE and add GstGameplay.CrossPlayEnable 0</p>



<p>The change will ensure you are no longer matched against players using a controller, but there is one problem with doing this… Players have found that despite the game reportedly already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a>, the overwhelming majority use a controller, and at this moment in time, you’ll likely be playing against bots.</p>



<p>Ottr’s theory here is that the more people add the code to their files, the more mouse-and-keyboard players there’ll be, and as such, the lobbies will fill up faster with no bots.</p>



<p>It is worth pointing out, though, that editing your game files at this moment in time <strong>might not be worth it</strong>, as a future patch will be nerfing aim assist by around 25%. So if you are on PC, maybe hold off for now. Or if you don’t yet have the game and are deciding which platform to buy it on, it is <a target="_blank" title="Battlefield 6 - Loaded (Xbox Series X|S)" href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-xbox-series-xs/" data-shortcode="true">currently discounted by 17%</a> on the Xbox Series S|X. </p>

<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160061/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The beat ‘em up genre has experienced something of a renaissance in the last generation, with original titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fightn_rage1">Fight’n Rage</a> (2019) and more recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> (2025) finding new ways to move the genre forward, while releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> (2020) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> (2022) show how effectively classics can be modernised. It makes sense, then, that Arc System Works wanted to find a way to bring back Technōs Japan's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/double_dragon">Double Dragon</a>, one of the progenitors of the whole genre.</p>
<p>Yet after the middling response of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden</a> (2023), the company decided to go back to the drawing board when it tried again with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a>. This release is a much more straightforward entry in the long-running series. Despite having some interesting ideas going for it, Double Dragon Revive unfortunately lacks polish and comes across as a very ‘okay’ experience.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160070/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Surprisingly enough, it is very story-driven, complete with fully voiced and partially animated anime cutscenes. The narrative here is set (rather oddly) several years after the conclusion of a nuclear war, with society breaking down into a collection of warring city-states ruled by various groups that have managed to seize power. In Billy and Jimmy Lee’s hometown, a nasty group of thugs called the Shadow Gang run the show, and the plot kicks off with them kidnapping (again) the boys’ childhood friend Marian, leading to the famed duo hitting the streets to get her back.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don’t usually play a beat ‘em up for a riveting and emotional story, but the narrative here actually feels pretty interesting and goes a step beyond the typical basic setup most entries in this genre will go for. Those cutscenes go a long way towards setting up a moderately interesting world and characters, even if it does sometimes come off as a bit cheesy and over-the-top.</p>
<p>As far as gameplay is concerned, this entry plays genre conventions relatively straight, with the addition of the key gimmick that the action plays out on more of a 3D plane than strictly 2D. Otherwise, you still move from screen to screen, comboing waves of baddies and occasionally picking up a knife or sledgehammer to dole out intense street justice. Another new gimmick here is that you can use your environment to your advantage, such as knocking enemies into cars for quick kills that net you lots of points.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160068/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Double Dragon Revive has all the basics and even has some cool ideas in how it implements them, but the actual execution of these mechanics falters. Movement consistently feels rigid and janky, while the level design is sometimes lacking. One stage involves a forced platforming challenge that the controls <em>definitely</em> aren’t designed for, and there are many encounters where annoying enemy placement can lead to things like getting ganked from firebomb-wielding foes attacking you from off-screen. It’s the kind of game that feels frustrating, and not in the <em>good</em> way that many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-soulslikes-games-to-play-if-you-like-dark-souls">soulslikes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-roguelikes-roguelites-and-run-based-games">roguelikes</a> manage to hit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things are saved somewhat by the moderate depth of your character’s moveset, which helps make things feel a bit more dynamic. Alongside the lead brothers, there are two unlockable characters whose unique movesets have their pros and cons that give the moment-to-moment gameplay variety. Carefully determining when and where to make certain moves, such as a screen-clearing special attack that builds up as you combo enemies, makes combat encounters more than a simple button-mashing fest.</p>
<p>And of course, in classic beat ‘em up fashion, you can be joined by another player in either couch or online co-op sessions (no drop-in, though) for some good ‘ol multiplayer fun. In my experience, the online environment on Switch is already a total ghost town, but the local co-op is just as engaging as you’d imagine and it tends to amplify the fun factor when you're beating up screens of foes in a friendly ‘co-opetition’. Capping the multiplayer at just two players feels like a bit of a weird decision, but then again it is called <em>Double</em> Dragon, and not <em>Multiple</em> Dragon.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160075/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as replayability is concerned, there’s a decent amount of content here to justify the price tag. You’re given a ranking at the end of each stage based on score and overall performance, and this, paired with the selection of playable characters, means there’s fair reason for repeat playthroughs to try mastering every stage with every character.</p>
<p>Once you’ve tired out the main campaign, you can then turn to the ‘Extra’ mode where you can do a series of bite-sized missions that also add little vignettes that flesh out the story a bit more. As long as the core gameplay clicks for you, there’s plenty to do here.</p>
<p>Visually, Double Dragon Revive leaves a lot to be desired, mostly sticking to a lifeless and generic-looking 3D art style that immediately makes the game look cheap. Environments have detailed but ultimately forgettable designs, while the 3D models of all the characters on screen are stiffly animated and tend to lack charm. Nothing explicitly looks <em>bad,</em> but the visuals don’t leave much of an impression.</p>
<figure><a title="Double Dragon Revive Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160071/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the anime-styled cutscenes are more interesting, but they only serve to further contrast how middling the rest of the game looks when you’re actually playing it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the soundtrack does a better job of supporting the action, mixing together a collection of house, drum and bass, rock, and pop tracks to make for an energetic soundscape. It can be a bit easy to overlook the music amid all the howls and sound effects of a fight, but I thought this music was a pretty solid companion to the action and does a good job of contributing to the scrappy atmosphere the developers are clearly going for here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Double Dragon Revive is the sort of game that’s just damningly mediocre. It doesn’t fumble the ball too hard in any significant way, but neither does it really excel at offering a fun and engaging beat ‘em up. Interesting gameplay ideas are held back by uneven execution, and the uninspired graphical style kind of takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>This will have its fans, and it’s worth purchasing on a deep sale someday, but it’s definitely nowhere close to the list of games I’d recommend to someone wanting to expand their beat-‘em-up collection. Perhaps Billy and Jimmy will wow us with their inevitable next outing, but this one is just 'alright'.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the most anticipated releases remaining this year, with millions of players pre-registering for launch, and we’ve got all the details on the title’s free-to-play status.</p>



<p>Launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> as a PlayStation console exclusive and also on PC, Where Winds Meet has seen over seven million pre-registrations ahead of its global launch, having achieved vast success in China, where it was released in December 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how much you will need to splash out to play Where Winds Meet or whether it is free to play, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-where-winds-meet-free-to-play">Is Where Winds Meet Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to do. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet is completely free to play, with optional monetization coming in the form of cosmetics for your character and in-game currencies.</strong></p>



<p>While there are bonuses that can be purchased ahead of launch, including PlayStation’s $14.99 pre-order edition that includes an outfit set, Player Name Card, in-game common currency, and two in-game draw items, that approach is entirely optional. It does not provide any major gameplay boosts.</p>



<p>Additionally, cosmetics and in-game currency can also be purchased separately inside the game, though, again, it’s entirely optional and won’t lock you out of any major content if you decide not to splash out.</p>



<p>Instead, you can enjoy Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar, as the game is available in its entirety for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-where-winds-meet-for-free">How to Play Where Winds Meet For Free</h2>



<p><strong>There are two big steps to playing Where Winds Meet for free, as it requires downloading the game and creating an account.</strong></p>



<p>While Where Winds Meet can be played entirely in single player, a constant internet connection is required, and you also need a dedicated account with the game in order to play. The bonus of this is regular benefits, including pre-registration rewards, being distributed into your account.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to jump into Where Winds Meet without spending a single dollar.</p>



<ol>
<li>Sign in to your Steam or PlayStation account.</li>



<li>Search for ‘Where Winds Meet’.</li>



<li>Download the title.</li>



<li>Launch the game.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian has said it’s well aware that whenever it announces a new game, people ask where Fallout: New Vegas 2 is, but it loves how it’s been able to create new IP and even release sequels to them — and its owner Microsoft sounds like it supports that approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 is set to hit Prime Video this December, and while Bethesda has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced-on-fallout-day-here-are-the-contents">a new Fallout: New Vegas bundle</a> up its sleeve, there’s no word yet on a Fallout remaster or a Fallout: New Vegas 2 to capitalize on the surge of interest in the franchise. Obsidian is of course the developer of the much-loved 2010 RPG Fallout: New Vegas, so fans often wonder whether it will return to the setting for a sequel, especially given it’s owned by Bethesda parent company Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian, though, has focused on making brand new games, and it is prolific in doing so. It’s released Grounded (Grounded 2 came out this year), fantasy RPG Avowed (which came out this year), and sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds (The Outer Worlds 2 came out this year). Pentiment, which came out last year, was another brand new game, although I wouldn’t expect a sequel to that any time soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/of-course-working-at-obsidian-is" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Obsidian’s VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of production Justin Britch touched on the fan calls for a New Vegas follow-up, but pointed to its work establishing new franchises as a “joy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, ‘When’s the next New Vegas? Or when’s the next whatever?” Morgan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But this year, in addition to it being a celebration of shipping three games, all three of those games are IP that we’ve created, that are Obsidian IP. Our history, prior to the Microsoft acquisition, really was surrounding around working on others’ IP. And this is the joy that we get of… how do we start to define our own and how do we build our own IP? And we’ve got to the part where we have sequels to all of them. All of them are sequels to the IP we created.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like Microsoft has supported Obsidian’s desire to do just that, even though you’d think the mega corp might have gone hard on Fallout, especially with the hugely popular Fallout TV show breaking through into the mainstream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Xbox has been pretty supportive of the stuff we want to do,” Britch insisted. “It’s been great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) have called on Bethesda to develop.

Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Happy Bday Fallout: New Vegas</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, The Outer Worlds 2 has strong New Vegas vibes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has added a feature to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> that you might be surprised wasn’t there all along: Display-Off Downloads. Now, the console can download games with the screen off, entering a new low-power download mode before going to sleep upon completion.</p>
<p>This new mode is now in the Beta and Preview channels of SteamOS, and will be rolled out to all users eventually. At that point, it will be the default mode when the Steam Deck is plugged in to power, and can be enabled when on battery power manually under Settings &gt; Power.</p>


<p>If you’re downloading a game or updates at the time that you press the power button to turn off the Steam Deck, it will prompt if you’d like to continue downloading with the screen off. It will also enter this mode automatically after being idle for some time. While downloading, you’ll be able to check on downloads by waking the screen, and can fully wake or let it continue.</p>
<p>When using this with battery power, the Steam Deck will halt downloads and go to full sleep if the battery drops below 20%.</p>

<p>Display-off downloads are similar in concept to the standby mode downloads and updates that are possible on Xbox, PS5 and Switch, but with SteamOS being built on a branch of Linux, it’s much more like a PC in some of its workings. This is a good step closer to the console experience, when compared to needing to manually enable and enter more basic screen-off modes as with Windows-based handhelds, laptops and PCs.</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is going to offer something even for returning players who have completed the original PSX release or the Nintendo 3DS remake released back in 2016, a new ending that's never been seen before in any other version of the game.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Reimagined follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations,"</em>  game producer Takeshi Ichikawa told Game Informer during the publication's recent visit to Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</em></p>



<p>While Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will follow the original narrative and add a new ending, the new version of the seventh entry in the series will<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"> feature significant gameplay changes that are set to improve the experience considerably</a>. Among these changes is a renewed battle system that will power more dynamic enemy encounters, evolved party members and enemy movesets and behaviours, the ability to skip combat against weak foes by attacking them on the field, a redesigned UI with a tab-based menu system for easy navigation, and more.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, which launches on February 5, 2026, is the next series' remake to launch on PC and consoles in recent times, following the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. The latter was released last week on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, introducing new features to the first two entries in the series that update the experience without taking away their classic feel. You can learn more about the latest series' remake by checking out <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">my review.</a></p>

            <p>Like an asteroid touching down in a freshly shaken martini, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> is now available on Steam, and some players have been having trouble playing it. I don't mean the people who don't understand inflation or why they can't make friends with Greenland. I mean the people who can't even get the new 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> to launch, because their PCs are too pitifully puny for this behemoth of history. Don't fret, those people. The hardware Popes at Paradox are blessing your meagre graphics cards with a sneaky workaround.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We´ve noticed that many players crash the game due to the hardware being too weak," explains <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3450310/discussions/0/652585529159908400/">a launch-day Steam post</a>. "There is a way to force the game into a very low preset." To do that, you'll want to right-click EU5 in your Steam library, go to the General and add "-graphic_preset=very_low" to the launch options.
</p>
<p>The post also notes some other problems with the game becoming unresponsive and going all black-screeny when launching from Steam. Apparently, this has to do with the Vulkan renderer, and the solution again is to right-click EU5 in your library and add "-dx12" to the launch options. You can combine this move with the forced very low graphics preset.
</p>
<p>If none of that works, well, here's the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/europa-universalis-v-bug-reports.1190/">official Paradox bug report forum</a>.
</p>
<p>Our Brendy (RPS in peace) deemed Europa Universalis 5 to be a honking good time and also an atrocious burden on his mental resources that is sometimes better beheld in mild horror than played. "When the game is understandable, it is hugely gratifying," he wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">Europa Universalis 5 review</a>. "But it also feels a bit 'you cannot press this button until you press that other button'. And that other button is obscured in a warren of menus you must spend nights coming to understand. It's a hugely deep pool of wonderful tricks to get lost in, but a pool still sweaty from all the confused forum posters who dived in before you."
</p><p>How are you getting on, if you're playing? A few years ago I reached the conclusion that Europa Universalis is not for me, but I quite like the idea of founding Iceland, getting really obsessive about lumber, and just sitting out most of the second millennium.</p>
<p>Nobody's going to bother Iceland much, right? AFAIK it's all volcano and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> servers. Seriously, how many spreadsheets does it take to manage a country the size of Iceland. If you are from Iceland, please let me know. I'm pretty sure you live within shouting distance of the Treasury. Also please don't get offended by my characterisation and go viking again - England has little to plunder besides branches of Gail's right now.</p>

		<p>I genuinely punched the air and whooped at my laptop screen when YoghurtDaddy's header pinged off the crossbar and into the net.&nbsp;</p><p>My <em>Rematch</em> team – all strangers – had conceded an early goal and then weathered a five-minute onslaught.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>At one point in </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>, the game’s protagonist Atsu finds herself within the torchlit courtyard of a fortress where one of her enemies is preparing to stage a play. This production is meant to recreate the worst moment of Atsu’s life, when her family was brutally murdered in front of her as a child and she was left for dead. Throughout the game, Atsu has trekked across an early 17</span><span>th</span><span>-century Hokkaido, part of a region then known as Ezo, in search of the Yotei Six, the group of killers responsible for the slaughter. Her hunt has led her to find one of them now planning to relive her tragedy in the form of a night’s entertainment. A backdrop is painted with the image of her family’s ginkgo tree, where she was left for dead. Soldiers mill around, waiting for the show to begin. Their leader, one of the masked killers from her past, orders his underlings to get the details of the massacre correct. He shouts for more fire, louder music, to capture the excitement of the night.</span></p> <p><span>Seeing her past reimagined in this way sends Atsu into a blind rage, expressed in-game as a new ability that drenches the screen in a dark, bloody red, and drives her into a violent frenzy. She slices through enemy after enemy, leaving the would-be stage strewn with corpses and fallen weapons. How her history is represented matters deeply to her. Its distortion makes her furious.</span></p>

 <h2>Imperfect Fictions And Partial Realities</h2> <p><span>Alongside </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>, a number of this year’s other highest-profile games have taken place in the past. </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, sequel to a 2018 action RPG, is set in 1403 Bohemia, amidst the turmoil of wars fought between forces loyal to King Wenceslas IV and King Sigismund. </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span> brings the long-running series to late 16</span><span>th</span><span>-century Japan, during the latter part of the country’s Sengoku period—an era defined by decades of civil war. </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>, for its part, follows fledgling mafioso Enzo Favara as he enters the world of Sicilian organized crime in the first decade of the 20</span><span>th </span><span>century.</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of these games takes a different approach to design and storytelling, but they have a lot in common beneath the surface. All of them are about characters seeking some form of revenge against those who have wronged them in their youth, from the mine bosses who controlled young Enzo’s life in </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, to the leaders who have ripped apart the lives of the protagonists in </span><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>. Apart from </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, they all feature real figures from history as allies and enemies. Most importantly, they all invite a modern audience to enter virtual versions of history by setting their action in lavishly imagined depictions of a bygone world, each using advanced technology to make the past seem alive on-screen.</span></p>

  <p><span>Historical video games typically gesture toward realism, with “realism” used as a catch-all term for the reproduction of detail. As in a period movie, TV show, play, or novel, these details often involve recreating the look and sound of a previous era by using primary sources, like contemporary writing, art, and preserved artifacts, as reference. The design of a soldier’s armor, the architecture of a Japanese or Bohemian castle, or the make of guns and cars available in 1900s Sicily—video games are often very good at capturing these kinds of details. In storytelling, too, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> all place their protagonists in narratives punctuated by actual historical events, like wars and peace agreements, the development of new governments and technologies. How these details are used in portraying a recreation of the past, though, is just as important to a game’s outcome as the narrow accuracy of its set dressing.</span></p>

 <p><span>The telling of history—and the creation of historical fiction—is always a process of interpretation. As much as we like to imagine history as a clear record of what’s come before us, our knowledge of the past develops through an imperfect process guided by what evidence is available to us, and how that evidence is understood by the perspectives of the people studying it.</span></p>

 <p><span>The late Hilary Mantel, a British author best known for her trilogy of novels centered on Thomas Cromwell, spoke about her approach to historical fiction in 2017 for the </span><i><span>BBC</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Reith Lecture</span></i><span> series. It’s an essential listen (</span><a href="https://medium.com/@bbcradiofour/hilary-mantel-bbc-reith-lectures-2017-aeff8935ab33"><span>or, transcribed here, read</span></a><span>) for anyone interested in Mantel’s work, historical fiction, and the study of history in general. One selection from it in particular is worth quoting at length here.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Evidence is always partial,” Mantel says. “Facts are not truth, though they are part of it—information is not knowledge. And history is not the past—it is the method we have evolved of organizing our ignorance of the past. It’s the record of what’s left on the record. It’s the plan of the positions taken, when we stop the dance to note them down. It’s what’s left in the sieve when the centuries have run through it—a few stones, scraps of writing, scraps of cloth. It’s no more ‘the past’ than a birth certificate is a birth, or a script is a performance, or a map is a journey. It’s the multiplication of the evidence of fallible and biased witnesses, combined with incomplete accounts of actions not fully understood by the people who performed them. It’s no more than the best we can do, and often it falls short of that.”</span></p> <p><span>Given the added layer of remove that historical </span><i><span>fiction</span></i><span> involves, the genre requires something like an interpretation of an interpretation to function. “Historical accuracy” is only possible in a pretty slight sense, in games like </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</span></i><span>. Because of this, it’s usually more worthwhile to consider what a game’s interpretation of history tells us about its artistic and dramatic priorities, rather than to get mired in examinations of whether a game is “realistic” or not. There’s more value in figuring out what, consciously or not, a game says about the time period it’s set within—and what that might mean for how we imagine our present-day reality.</span></p> <p><span>When you take this approach, one aspect of this year’s historical video games that sticks out is how much they’re invested in nature. Though built and played on computers, each of the above games is obsessed with translating the experience of inhabiting the natural landscape of the past.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641214">©Deep Silver</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span>, for instance, involves a lot of walking and riding around storybook Central European landscapes, from densely wooded forests and rolling green fields, to pleasantly burbling brooks. </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>both take a kind of maximalist approach to their landscapes, cramming as much Japanese iconography as possible into their sprawling maps. In their visions of the 16</span><span>th</span><span> and 17</span><span>th</span><span> centuries, bamboo forests grow thick just a few minutes’ horse ride away from snow-covered cliffs or stands of trees dropping fiery red, orange, and yellow autumn leaves. Cherry blossoms twirl on the wind in one part of the map, while winter arrives with gusts of freezing wind and iced-over ponds a stone’s throw away. In </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, the sun bakes grassy fields, with purple flowers blossoming in punctuation, and valleys dip down into riverbeds, all with Mount Etna smouldering on the horizon.</span></p> <p><span>There’s a sense, in each game, that the past is a place of greater beauty than the present — that the Kingdom of Bohemia, Japan, and Sicily were better, in some fundamental sense, during a time long before us. This is true, in some senses. Before industrialization, the landscapes of every one of the regions featured in these games would have been more vibrant. </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>, taking place in the early 20</span><span>th</span><span> century, shows this in alternating vistas of unspoiled rural landscapes and those blighted by the growth of factories, their smokestacks and machinery cutting across what might have been a picturesque canyon. There are also, of course, battlefields in each game. </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span>’s are smaller in scale, consisting of burning warehouses and ancient ruins strewn with newly killed bodies, but the others are grander. </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Deliverance 2</span></i><span> feature castle sieges and swordfights, with dozens of soldiers rushing at one another to struggle and die on ramparts and in fields, leaving their corpses to fill ditches or lie unburied in courtyards.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641215">©2K</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, </span><i><span>The Old Country</span></i><span> aside, the ugliness of these battlefields still possesses a romantic element, as if the dead bodies and breached fortresses are tapestries and paintings showing a time when war was waged with something like dignity. The guns and explosions are primitive, their effect nothing like the city-annihilating rockets and automatic fire of latter eras. Their battles, like their natural world, seems better than ours. There’s a romance to their brutality, a heroism to their killing.</span></p> <h2>The Kinds Of Stories We Tell Ourselves</h2> <p><span>The downside of this romanticism is that it has a way of obscuring our picture of the past — of its fantasies overtaking reality to present something easier to imagine. In the 19</span><span>th</span><span> and 20</span><span>th</span><span> centuries, an idealized historical image gave rise to the romantic nationalism of regions across the world, pulling from old epics and folk traditions to create newly narrowed visions of ethnic belonging. It’s not hard for the cultural imagination to move from praising the beauty of a region’s landscapes and the valor of its ancestors to applying an exclusionary outlook to its possible citizenry or promoting a vision of ethnic supremacy within and outside of its borders. A version of this thinking led to the fascist governments of countries like the Second World War’s Axis Powers: Italy, Germany, and Japan. It lives on today, in the national romance of countries across the world whose governments appeal to an ethnically or religiously homogenous past in order to justify discriminatory or violent policies at home and abroad.</span></p> <p><span>Because a people’s history plays such an essential part in this process, historical fiction, like all historical art, can be a fraught genre. The first </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> revolves around what’s depicted as a foreign invasion, resisted by its virtuous Czech characters. Along with its creator’s insistence on an all-white cast of characters, it presents a version of the past with unsavory implications for the present. (I wrote about this more back when the game came out, in a piece I’m</span><a href="https://unwinnable.com/2018/03/02/deliverance-myth-making-and-historical-accuracy/"> <span>linking here</span></a><span> to avoid repeating myself). Its sequel maintains certain issues from the first game, but it also complicates its portrayal with a greater emphasis on the prejudices of its era and the universal horrors faced by those living at the whims of their society’s upper classes. </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span> has problems similar to those of </span><i><span>Deliverance</span></i><span>. Like the sequel, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span>, its late 13</span><span>th</span><span>-century Japan is an idealized abstraction of cultural iconography, its contortions of another foreign invasion presenting a story of honor-obsessed, movie-influenced samurai fending off Mongol conquest. (At the time of </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>’s release, Kazuma Hashimoto</span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21333631/ghost-of-tsushima-kurosawa-films-samurai-japan-abe-politics/"> <span>dug into this issue</span></a><span>, as did</span><a href="https://bulletpointsmonthly.com/2020/08/06/spectre-of-fascism-ghost-of-tsushima"> <span>Andrew Kiya</span></a><span>, and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/08/14/like-ghost-tsushima-heres-what-you-may-not-know-about-samurai/"> <span>me, too</span></a><span>.)</span></p>

 <p><span>By moving the setting from an era of nationalist mythmaking to the beginning of the Edo or Tokugawa period, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> sidesteps some of the thornier issues that its still-romantic vision of Japan presents. The main conflict in the game is between Japanese characters, with Atsu’s hunt for the Yotei Six focused on personal tragedies borne not of foreign interference but of civil war. Like </span><i><span>Deliverance 2 </span></i><span>and, in a much weaker plot, </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> is mostly concerned with the ways in which ordinary people’s lives are torn apart by wars waged by the rulers of feudal societies. Atsu and the villains who killed her family are all driven to further violence by the aftereffects of the civil wars that wracked Japan until the consolidation of power under the Tokugawa shogunate, which takes place shortly before the events of the game begin. The Yotei Six’s leader, Saito, controls Hokkaido as the informal, fictional “Shogun of the North” at the time the plot starts, but his massacre of Atsu’s family takes place while he was a bandit leader, living in desperation as an exile who fought on the losing side of the Battle of Nagashino. Rather than portray its main characters as people possessing some intrinsic cultural heroism or villainy, </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>brings its drama down to a more human level.</span></p> <p><span>This choice goes a long way toward sidestepping the implications of </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>’s romantic view of history. But the game’s setting, in early 17</span><span>th</span><span>-century Hokkaido, introduces other wrinkles. Though the Ainu, a people indigenous to Hokkaido and nearby islands, are represented in-game, they’re largely ancillary to the plotline—a bit of local culture to spot between the greater focus on mainland Japanese characters, like the real-world Matsumae clan, who are represented in </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> as fighting to emancipate Hokkaido of Saito’s rule. In the real world, the Matsumae were instrumental in the early process of colonizing the Ainu, which would continue for centuries until the 19</span><span>th</span><span>-century formation of Imperial Japan increased the brutality of the project, emulating the horrific European model to</span><a href="https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/ainu-beyond-politics-cultural-coexistence"> <span>subjugate and assimilate</span></a><span> the Ainu people.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span>’s representation of Ainu characters is, in some ways, commendable for the fact that it exists at all. The presence of characters like a saddle maker, bemoaning the arrival of immigrants who bring new violence to his land, or traders selling crafts and clothes, is important because it offers a corrective to the usual erasure of the Ainu people in popular depictions of Japan. But their marginal participation in the game’s main plotline makes the Hokkaido of </span><i><span>Yotei</span></i><span> too similar to the first game’s Tsushima. It creates a romantic </span><i><span>feeling</span></i><span> of Japan based on a gloss of history that’s not always inaccurate, in the sense of detail, but misses the complicated texture that a less mythologically inclined story might have embraced.</span></p> <p><span>Embracing these complications, as all of 2025’s historical fiction games show, often results in the most compelling narratives, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>The inclusion of Yasuke, an African samurai, as one of </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span>’ two main characters offers one example of these complications. </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> isn’t a great game, and its storytelling is largely too flat to make good on either of its protagonists’ plotlines, but Yasuke’s personal story arc is more engaging than the otherwise thin revenge story that takes more precedence. Rather than the totally isolated country depicted in so many games set in a similar time period, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> reminds its players that Japan, a country whose samurai stories often take place within the isolationism of the Tokugawa era, was always part of a larger world. Just as </span><i><span>Mafia: The Old Country</span></i><span> couples Sicily’s pastoral beauty with the bloodshed of organized crime and industrialism, factories like engorged ticks feasting on the landscape, </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> features Portuguese slave traders disrupting a romantic vision of Japan with the intrusion of the global politics of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in her </span><i><span>Reith Lecture</span></i><span>, Mantel states that “readers are touchingly loyal to the first history they learn—and if you challenge it, it’s as if you’re taking away their childhoods.” She could as easily be talking about the</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511"> <span>aggrieved internet reaction</span></a><span> to Yasuke’s inclusion in </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> as any other work of historical fiction that challenges a culturally dominant vision of the past. Some audiences might be comforted by samurai stories that deny the influence of the outside world on a bygone Japan, just as the inclusion of the same broader scope</span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-discuss-woke-diversity-complaints-culture-war/"> <span>prompted backlash</span></a><span> to </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>’s sequel. Others might find themselves intrigued to discover new dimensions to their understanding of an historical era. Or, as Mantel puts it: “For a person who seeks safety and authority, history is the wrong place to look. Any worthwhile history is a constant state of self-questioning, just as any worthwhile fiction is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>At its best, historical fiction is able to capture just how alien the world before us might have looked to our eyes while reminding us, too, that even the most unfamiliar stories from our past are part of a universal human narrative, interconnected and complex. History, in all its forms, isn’t simple, because humanity isn’t simple. The Middle Ages and early modern period weren’t stage plays. They, too, were times when people were perpetrators and victims of violence and dislocation, the recipients and providers of courageous and kind acts. How the past looks varies from person to person, culture to culture, nation to nation. It’s a vast expanse, with known and unknown territory alike to explore. It is, essentially, a story we tell about ourselves, sometimes through the plots of video games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> and the other games mentioned above are entertainment, but they’re also recitals of these stories. They’re one of the many stages on which we make sense of everything that’s led to our present day. It’s worthwhile to want what happens in them to reflect the complexity of the lives that have come before our own.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-mafia-old-country-ac-shadows-kingdom-come-deliverance-historical-fiction-games-2000641188]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a>, the first-person soulslike action game set in an alt-history Napoleonic era, is out next year. And with developer One More Level especially pushing the “Soulslike”-ness of the whole thing, it seems only natural that at some point before or after launch there’s going to be a discussion about the game’s difficulty - is it too hard? Is it hard enough? Should it have an easy mode, or something else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty discussion, of course, is one that crops up every time a new Souls game is released. What makes difficulty fun, and what makes it obnoxious? Should games have easy modes? What sorts of accessibility features are helpful to ensure everyone can play the game and experience its design friction as intended, without experiencing other, undesirable friction due to controls or other functions?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played Valor Mortis at the Game Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, and while I’m only of middling Soulslike skills, I can confirm it’s pretty tough! I also spoke with game director Radosław Ratusznik, who says that the team is still in discussions as to how they will approach all this. For now, he says, Valor Mortis just has one difficulty setting. But that may change in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we decide at one point to change it, I think we will change it for easy mode and normal mode, just two of them. Because I think that players should have similar experiences when they're playing these kinds of games. So personally, I'm fine with the easy mode, if someone wants to just experience the story, learn a little bit about how the game works. But if we have a lot of options, like there are like tens of difficulty options, then each person can play a totally different game. I think what connects Soulslike players is that they are all struggling in these games. If they manage to succeed in this game, they can share this experience with other players. And this is something that has a huge value I think for them, for this community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s nuance here, because while Ratusznik may be against having ten difficulty options ranging from Story Mode to Ultra Hard Giga Death Difficulty, he agrees that discussions around difficulty often don’t take into account the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/05/sekiro-accessibility-in-games-is-about-far-more-than-difficulty"><u>nuance of accessibility</u></a>. He’s not a fan, for instance, of games that let you turn on and off certain mechanics (such as parries), because he thinks that players “lose something from this experience.” But he also adds that, as far as accessibility goes, “we can have a lot of things that can assist you without lowering the difficulty of the game.” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-difficulty-accessibility-easy-mode-debate"><u>Accessibility isn’t solved with an easy mode</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Soulslikes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ratusznik isn’t alone in this belief. FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/hidetaka-miyazaki-sees-death-as-a-feature-not-a-bug" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said similar of Elden Ring</u></a>, “We are always looking to improve, but, in our games specifically, hardship is what gives meaning to the experience. So it’s not something we’re willing to abandon at the moment. It’s our identity.” But also notably, Elden Ring was far more flexible than FromSoftware’s past games in the ways in which it allowed players to eventually conquer challenges. You could outlevel bosses to make them trivially easy if you wandered off and defeated enough weaker enemies, there are some builds that turn certain bosses into jokes, and there’s so much to do in the game and so many paths to victory that if you’re struggling with something, Elden Ring encourages you to leave and do something else. Another recent Soulslike, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is similar in this structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How Valor Mortis will ultimately handle its difficulty remains to be seen, as Ratusznik himself says that the team is still working out what they want to do. We won’t know til next year when the game launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also spoke to Ratusznik at GIC about Valor Mortis’ soulslike credentials, and why it’s challenging to make a game in that tradition in the first-person. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valor-mortis-dev-dares-fans-to-question-the-games-soulslike-credentials-if-you-are-not-sure-about-it-challenge-us">You can read our conversation right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has celebrated the launch of Fortnite's new The Simpsons mini-season, which it says has welcomed "the biggest number of new and returning Fortnite players since last holiday season."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Public player data tracked by <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortnite.gg</a> shows that a peak of 2.6 million players logged on both Saturday and Sunday, firstly to watch the live event that introduced The Simpsons aliens Kang and Kodos to Fortnite's battle royale Island, and secondly to then play on the game's new Springfield map when it came online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The live event saw Fortnite's heroes scooped up in a UFO and transported to Springfield Island, a mash-up of Fortnite and The Simpsons filled with familiar locations and Easter eggs from the long-running animated series. Fan response to the new season and its highly-detailed map has been positive, and Epic Games seems pleased with player numbers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players since last holiday season," the developer wrote in a social media <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ today in the US. Move over Shelbyville..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's player numbers have dipped somewhat this year, amid tough competition from Roblox and a string of battle royale seasons that feel like they haven't landed with fans quite as expected. In September, during the game's alien bug season, the game's average daily numbers briefly sagged to around half a million players, though player counts then rallied as Fortnite began its annual Halloween celebrations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While 2.6 million players this past weekend is impressive, Fortnite has recorded several higher player spikes this year for other events. A peak of 5.7 million players logged in on June 7 for Death Star Sabotage, the game's live event that served as the finale of its Star Wars mini-season. Fortnite also saw a spike to 3.9 million players on August 2 for its superhero season finale, and 3.3 million players for the launch of its Daft Punk Experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What remains to be seen is how many of those new and returning players stick around over the rest of this month, as Fortnite's The Simpsons season culminates in a big live event on November 29. This is expected to usher in the game's next big era — Chapter Seven — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting">that looks set to feature a crossover with Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and, potentially, the return of Fortnite's heroic Seven faction</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/05/nintendo-makes-the-switch-2-its-primary-development-focus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-makes-the-switch-2-its-%E2%80%9Cprimary-development-focus%E2%80%9D-as-though-it-wasn%E2%80%99t-already.1344199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has confirmed that they are shifting to have the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> be their “primary development focus” going forward, indicating that cross-gen game releases will become far from the norm after 2026.</p>
<p>The company plainly states that “Going forward, we will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.”</p>


<p>It’s a small statement from Nintendo’s latest quarterly financial report, which saw the company announce that the Switch 2 has continued its record-setting launch and has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/the-switch-2-sold-over-10-million-consoles-in-just-4-months/">already sold more than 10 million consoles after just four months</a> – selling faster than the original Switch, PS5 and PS4 through the same time span. With such rapid early momentum, it absolutely makes sense that Nintendo can focus more directly on the new generation of console.</p>
<p>This means that cross-gen games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will remain rare and fleeting. Metroid Prime 4 has been in development for so long (and is a relative niche for Nintendo) that it makes sense for it still to receive a cross-gen release when it arrives in December, while Pokémon always needs to try and reach as large an audience as possible… but then enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-hit-5-8-million-sales-and-half-of-them-are-on-switch-2/">around 50% of its launch sales on the newer system</a>.</p>
<p>2025 has already shown that Nintendo is all-in on the Nintendo Switch 2, launching with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> following shortly afterwards. Through the rest of this year, we still have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> to release as well.</p>

<p>For 2026, it’s also very heavy on the Switch 2 exclusives, with Pokémon Pokopia, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-announced-for-switch-2/">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/10/splatoon-raiders-is-a-fresh-switch-2-exclusive-spinoff-and-theres-a-big-update-for-splatoon-3-too/">Splatoon Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/mario-tennis-fever-swings-onto-switch-2-in-february/">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</a> all announced for next year. They’re also continuing to announce and release Switch 2 Edition upgrades for Switch games, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-revealed/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-coming-next-year/">Super Mario Wonder</a> both enhancing and expanding two big hits for the newer hardware.</p>
<p>That said, there are still some titles coming to original Switch, including Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, Rhythm Heaven Groove, and Pokémon Champions – all games that benefit from as large a potential audience as possible.</p>

			<p>A Steam Deck highly-requested feature has finally arrived with a new Beta Client update that went live a few hours ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/725769023703421533">The official November 4 Beta Client update notes</a> confirm that the system now features display-off low power downloads. This feature allows the Steam Deck to complete all active downloads in a new display-off mode before going to sleep. This feature is enabled by default when the system is plugged in to power, and can be toggled on and off by going into Settings and then Power.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck Beta Client update also fixes a couple of additional issues, swuch as SteamOS updates failing to respect HTTP proxy configuration and regression where the performance graph wouldn't display while streaming.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck display-off low-power downloads feature was further detailed in a dedicated blog post, which outlined the two ways to access the feature. The first way is to press the power button while the system is downloading content, which will bring up a new dialog box asking the user if they wish to continue downloading with the display off.</p>



<p>The second way is automatic, as the system will go into this mode after an idle timeout. Pressing a button after this happens will bring up a new status screen with the download progress, from where the user can either wake the system up completely or let it continue downloading in the new low power mode.</p>



<p>The new feature introduced in the latest Steam Deck Beta Client update is just one of the many improvements that have been added to the system launched in 2022, which helped kick-start the handheld PC gaming market. You can learn more about the portable system by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Kai Tatsumoto's review</a>. If you already own the system and want to make the most out of it, you should also consider the Chizha Mount Ling Dock, which&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-chizha-mount-ling-dock-review/">we reviewed last month.</a></p>
