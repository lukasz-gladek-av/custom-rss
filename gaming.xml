			<p>Work on the PlayStation 6 seems to be in a much more advanced stage than most people thought, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF Forums, well-known AMD leaker Kepler L2 commented on the next-generation system from Sony, revealing that its SoC is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design complete</a> and is currently in pre-silicon validation already, with A0 tapeout scheduled for late this year. While this may mean little to most, this new information suggests that the console may not be too far from release, as Sony's usual cadence between A0 tapeout and the release of a system is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270023151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 years</a>, meaning that, if this will be the same for the PlayStation 6, we could see the launch of the system in 2027.</p>
<p>The AMD leaker also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 6 GPU, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> it is a fork of AMD gfx13, which was formerly known as RDNA 5 and is now known as UDNA. The leaker couldn't say how big it will be, but the fact that it will belong to the gfx13 will eventually provide some information on some of its features once AMD fully unveils the architecture.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6 as of now besides the fact that it will once again be powered by AMD. This was revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a> in a report which confirmed that Intel lost the bid to produce the console to AMD due to a dispute over how much profit Intel would make from each chip sold to Sony which prevented the company from settling on a price.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maladum-review-taking-the-scenic-route.1086063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/maladum-review-taking-scenic-route<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battle Systems is a company known for their immersive cardboard terrain, which we’ve reviewed multiple times on the site. But what happens when a company that takes such careful care to create lavish scenery tries their hand at tabletop gaming? The result is something truly immersive. We saw it with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/on-tabletop-core-space" rel="nofollow">Core Space</a>, which we reviewed way back in 2019, and now they’ve sent me their fantasy tabletop skirmish game, <i>Maladum</i>, to check out. Read on for my review!</p>

<h2>What is <i>Maladum</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Maladum </i>is a cooperative tabletop board game experience that combines skirmish wargaming with tabletop RPG elements to create a unique, ongoing story-driven game focused on bringing heroes through dungeons, finding artifacts and treasure, and getting out while the getting’s good.</p>

<p>In <i>Maladum</i>, players take on the role of Adventurers, who each come with their own statistics, special abilities, and starting equipment. In the game, you’ll play through scenarios in order starting from the very beginning of your questing, and whether you win or fail at said scenario will determine the next scenario you play in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-overhead-shot.jpeg?itok=p4FDwYis 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-overhead-shot.jpeg?itok=QVsz1GQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at this beautiful, modularly set up board!</figcaption></figure><h2>What’s the <i>Maladum</i> Setting?</h2>

<p>The world of <i>Maladum</i> is set in the same world as <i>Core Space</i>, their sci-fi themed game that follows a similar structure. <i>Maladum </i>still takes place in that far-flung future, but so much time has passed that the world resembles something akin to a dark ages setting (it’s giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_to_Be_a_God_(2013_film)" rel="nofollow"><i>Hard to be a God</i></a>). Technology, once developed, honed, and understood, now feels more like magic - and your Adventurers know nothing of the greater universe beyond their squalid little planet.</p>

<h2>How does <i>Maladum</i> Play?</h2>

<p>But all this is simply trappings and background noise for a game that truly does feel wonderfully medieval and fantastical. In the game, you’ll use actions to move around the board - which is brilliantly decorated with Battle Systems one-of-a-kind cardboard 3D terrain - to defeat monsters by using weapons and rolling dice.</p>

<p>But the coolest part of <i>Maladum</i>, in my opinion, is the way treasure is looted in this game. Each treasure is represented by a little cardboard chit, which you’ll put into a drawstring bag. At the start of each adventure, you (without looking) fill 3D cardboard treasure chests with those tokens.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-treasure-chest.jpeg?itok=rqnXW-MD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-treasure-chest.jpeg?itok=NvEYQh5R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This treasure chest is full of actual loot tokens that you add to your character's game board!</figcaption></figure><p>When your hero opens a chest, you’ll gain all the tokens you have room to carry (there’s a psychical slot on your board used to hold tokens), and you may also accidentally draw trap tokens which dish out nasty damage.</p>

<p>The story moves along at a nice clip, seeing your heroes going off on branching quests based on whether you succeed or fail at a mission (and based on <i>how well</i> you succeed). From humble beginnings to powerful end-game encounters, your heroes will need to find excellent gear, level up, and keep striving.</p>

<h2><i>Maladum </i>Requires Patience</h2>

<p>While the gameplay is clean and easy to grasp, and the board always looks incredible, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the cost that such a decked out board requires: time. You’ll need patience to properly set up a board, snapping together the right walls, gathering the correct treasure tokens, and getting everything into place.</p>

<p>You don’t get a game as engrossing as this without putting in extra work, but set-up is not very speedy. And as with a long plane ride home from vacation, the break down of the game after a fun, lengthy session is more exhausting than the exciting set up.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-corridor-shot.jpeg?itok=R028IAv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-corridor-shot.jpeg?itok=6ziriNZt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The scenery is incredible but does require setting up and breaking down in between each scenario</figcaption></figure><p>And look, I know using a word like “exhausting” is a bit dramatic - we’re not mining coal here - but I think it’s really important to highlight that you’ll either need space to store everything built out, or you’ll need the patience required to build and break down each time you play. This is easier if everyone at the table chips in, of course, but for solo players you’ll be doing a lot of scenery snapping.</p>

<p>Luckily, the quality of the materials - even though they’re cardboard - are the same quality we’ve come to expect and respect from Battle Systems. Everything is sturdy, gloriously illustrated, and snaps together the way it’s intended to (though guides for building everything are not included in the box, you’ll have to watch YouTube videos from Battle Systems for the trickier bits).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-player-trays.jpeg?itok=FNTfnD2j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-player-trays.jpeg?itok=ImDvrV8s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Player trays and pegs track your character's progress, with a custom slot to hold inventory!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Maladum </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>All that grumbling aside, I still think <i>Maladum</i> shines head and shoulders above many other similar games. The gameplay loop is exciting, it’s really thrilling to open up a treasure chest and see what you’ve found, and it feels especially rewarding to sink your teeth into the story.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get absolutely lost in a cooperative fantasy game, you’ll find a lot to love about <i>Maladum</i>, with each new quest beckoning you to heed its call!</p>

			<p>Having a good headset is an increasingly important part of modern gaming, whether it’s helping you communicate with your teammates, immersing you in the audio design of your game, or helping to create a buffer between your gaming and the rest of your household. The range and breadth of options can be dizzying, though, especially if you want to get the best value for money. Cheaper options will do a job but can be unreliable, uncomfortable, or lacking in features, whilst the big hitters can cost almost as much as the consoles themselves! This makes the mid-range perhaps the most competitive area to shop in, and it is here that the SoundMagic P58BT ANC is placed. Available for around £70 – £80 from the usual online stores, this wireless headset has become my daily go-to for music and media, whilst also proving to be a solid option for gaming.</p>
<p>The P58BT are well packaged and come with a carry pouch and a USB-C cable for charging. The carry pouch does feel a little cheap though and is a little disappointing compared to the solid hard cases that other headsets provide – even ones at lower price points. It will keep your headphones free from crumbs and fluff in your bag but offers no impact protection whatsoever – obviously, this is only an issue if you plan to take them out and about. The packaging is pretty massive too and I was surprised how light the actual headset was once I opened it up. This is a good thing in my opinion, as I find some headphones uncomfortably heavy for wearing around and about, although I can appreciate the benefits of more sturdy ones for gaming purposes.</p>



<p>In terms of performance, I have been using the P58BT for a few weeks now and have had very few issues – aside from the couple of times that I forgot to charge them up and had to plug in a 3.5mm cable. The fact that you can do this is a real positive though as this isn’t a universally available feature. Being able to use such a cable also means that you can use the P58BT with Sony and Microsoft consoles for audio, but the microphone isn’t compatible for voice chat this way. It works fine for voice calls on phone and through Bluetooth on PC, and while it does benefit from CVC noise reduction, the end result isn’t as clear as a wired alternative. Audio quality is good with the 40mm dynamic driver unit offering a decent range and effective soundstage for positional audio when gaming.</p>
<p>The main connection is with Bluetooth 5.3, and this works as reliably as you’d hope. There is the option to connect to multiple devices simultaneously which is a welcome feature, so you can stay connected to both your PC/Switch and your phone if you want to. The active noise cancellation is solid enough and works well at cutting out the sound of your family in the background or the roar of traffic when sat on the bus. There is also an ambient sound mode which probably won’t be used whilst gaming, but is useful when out and about to keep you aware of your surroundings. Finally, there is an ultra-low latency gaming mode to help ensure a smooth experience in games.</p>


<p>In addition to being lightweight, the P58BT ANC are sturdily designed and comfortable to wear, with silicone earmuffs and headband, making them water and sweat-proof and promising more durability than the cheap faux–leather that is often used. The earmuffs have a decent amount of swivel to fit your head snugly and prevent sound leaking. The battery life is excellent too, with up to 60 hours depending on whether you are using ANC or not.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best feature of all, though, is the set of minimalist, but intuitive controls. There is a tactile button for power on and off which also switches between the ANC profiles, while a double press turning gaming mode on and off and a triple press to activate pairing. For general use, however, it is the touch control pad on the left earcup that is super easy to use. Volume controls just need a quick swipe up and down with track selection being mapped to left and right. Where touch controls can be a bit flaky on other headphones – even premium models like Sony’s earlier 1000XM series – it’s nice and reliable here, always registering my swipes as intended.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The SoundMagic P58BT ANC Headset is a good mid-range option for PC and mobile gaming, but is best suited as a general purpose Bluetooth headphones. Mic quality is not as good as competitors with physical booms but is good enough in a pinch. They’ve become my daily drivers for use with Switch and phone, but I’ve reverted to a wired set working through my DAC on PC.	</p></div>

Meanwhile, Elon Musk and YouTuber Asmongold have clashed after Asmongold was among those calling out Elon’s lack of prowess at <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>after the billionaire claimed to be one of the top-ranked players in the world.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> developer Mob Entertainment is suing Google for failing to remove "scam" apps from the Google Play store.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-pirated-poppy.pdf">legal papers</a> filed on Wednesday (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/poppy-playtime-sues-google-for-failing-to-remove-copyright-infringing-scam-apps-250116/">TorrentFreak</a>), Poppy Playtime's creators accuse Daigo Game 2020 Inc. of releasing "scam" apps intentionally advertised with names like Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime: Chapter 4 well before the instalments had been officially released for mobile devices.</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As well as blatantly using Poppy Playtime's name, promotional art also clearly uses Poppy Playtime's characters and screenshots from the authentic game's second chapter.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Mob contacted Google numerous times over several months, but each time an erroneous app is removed, it simply pops back up again a day or two later.</p>
<p>The apps reportedly don't even download a copycat or derivative game, either.</p>
<p>"Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play. Instead, it asks users to pay $30 to $95 for the 'Guide wuggy playtime mod'," the complaint added.</p><p>"Google receives a direct financial benefit from the infringement by the users at least because users with devices containing the application are given an offer to purchase the Guide wuggy playtime mod for up to $95. If they make the purchase, Google then receives 15-30 percent of the proceeds."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the scam game is still available to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PoPPyPlaytimeKing.BuggyChapterPlaytimeMOPckapter3&amp;hl=en">view</a>, and install, on the Google Play store. Unless players know, explicitly, who publishes the game, there's absolutely no way of telling them apart, particularly as it doesn't list a user score or link to user reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst the real game is a premium product and listed as having 10K+ downloads, the fake app has been downloaded over a million times.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Google forfeited the benefits of the DMCA's safe harbour provision for its infringement of Mob Entertainment's copyrighted works contained in the unauthorised 'Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3' and 'Poppy Playtime Chapter 4' applications," the court filing said.</p>
<p>"The unauthorised Poppy Playtime applications have tarnished Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime [copyright] mark by associating it with poor quality applications that are nothing but bait-and-switch scams.</p>
<p>"Google's illegal, unfair, and fraudulent business acts and practices have caused Mob Entertainment to spend copious amounts of resources, including its employees' time, in a fruitless effort to attempt to get Google to remove applications committing copyright infringement, trademark infringement, fraud, and other unlawful and unfair business acts and practices."</p><p>Mob Entertainment seeks "actual damages in an amount to be determined in excess of $75,000", all of Daigo and Google's profits from the scam apps, court costs, and $150,000 in damages per work infringed. It is also hoping for an injunction to prevent Google and Daigo violating its trademark in the future.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a line of game developers who have called out digital game stores for not promptly dealing with intentionally misleading or copyright-infringing games.</p>
<p>Just last month, the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, and days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">fans spotted Black Myth: Wukong imitations, too</a>. The 2D platformer's gameplay and presentation are markedly different, but its promotional art and title could easily be confused with that of Game Science's blockbuster.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This card has nearly tripled in value from the back end of 2024, with sold listings from December going for as low as £25. Most recent sales are going for between £60 to £80, and I don't see that price getting any cheaper as 2025 progresses.</p><p id="pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-12-silve"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silve">Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214259"><div id="214259" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">8 booster packs of Silver Tempest, Alolan Vulpix sleeves, dice, damage counters, and a cool box to store your bulk are a solid deal for £39.99.

            <p>Nintendo believes that "the best direction" for Switch 2 is to ensure players are "able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor".</p>
<p>In the absence of any other studio coming forward to confirm they were developing games for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/my-kids-first-meeting-with-nintendo?open=false#%C2%A7item-some-switch-notes-a-day-after-the-big-announcement">Game File</a> asked Nintendo to expand on what third-party developers it was working with. The reply didn't really address the question at hand, but did provide a little insight into Nintendo's view of backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch is played by many consumers, and we decided that the best direction to take would be for consumers to be able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor to Nintendo Switch," the company said.</p>
<p>"As a result of that thinking, Nintendo Switch 2 plays Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games.</p>
<p>"Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Details will be shared on the Nintendo website at a later date."</p>
<p>It's still not yet clear what "may not be fully compatible" means or what games won't make the cut. But the statement does, at least, intimate that Nintendo is acutely cognisant of the importance of backwards compatibility for players moving between Switch and Switch 2. Whilst Switch was not backwards compatible with Wii or Wii U, Wii U <em>was</em> backwards compatible with Wii games, just as the Nintendo 3DS was also able to run DS cartridges.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Here's everything we know so far about Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p>Summitsphere, <em>Antonblast</em>’s developer, describes the game as a “fast-paced explosive action platformer,” and that’s a good way to summarize how it actually feels to play. It’s sort of what would happen if you put <em>Wario</em>, <em>Sonic,</em> <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</em>, and <em>Rocko’s Modern Life</em> into a blender.</p><div><figcaption><em>Yes, there is grinding.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Summitsphere</cite></p></div><p>As Anton or Annie, you’ll charge through various enemies and obstacles in your path, sometimes turning into a literal tornado of chaos, to retrieve Spirits (as in drinks) from a villainous Satan, who has stolen and scattered them throughout 12 different levels.</p><p>The levels usually have some kind of gimmick or theme that is explored with an almost Nintendo-like degree of precision. One level frequently turns your character into a pinball. Another features sections where you transform into a bouncing, explosive bomb. One of my favorites was a maze-like bathhouse that, compared to the rest of the game, was eerily quiet. And at the end of nearly every level, you’ll activate a switch that starts a timer and begins a frantic and thrilling run back to the entrance.</p><p>For the most part, <em>Antonblast</em> encourages you to build momentum, like a classic <em>Sonic</em> game. It’s easy to get into a flow state of surging forward, even when things can feel out of control because of how fast you’re going or the amount of stuff onscreen. As I got better at the game, I actually started to feel more chill when things got out of hand. The game was usually leading me in the right direction, and I learned to just accept that things were happening as they should.</p><div><figcaption><em>The boss fights are pretty wild.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Summitsphere</cite></p></div><p>Occasionally, the game would have some tough platforming or annoyingly placed checkpoints that could take me out of the flow state — also like <em>Sonic</em>. Some of the bosses, which were often epic, screen-filling spectacles, could be frustratingly difficult. Fortunately, though, reloads are quick, which makes those frustrations a bit easier to deal with. The final level and boss are particularly challenging, but if you do get that far, trust me when I tell you that the payoff for seeing them through is worth it.</p><p>Like the ’90s-era cartoons that are its obvious inspirations, <em>Antonblast</em> can be a little loud and immature. There’s literally a button you can press just to have your character scream. But like the best of those shows, its creators clearly had fun making an over-the-top world, and they made it damn fun to play — even when I didn’t know what was going on.</p><p><small>Antonblast<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Steam.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world, boasting a community made up of millions of players. The ‘online portion’ of the game is thriving and continues to improve with time, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have a campaign</strong>? Is there anything for solo players to do in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>As something of a live service game, Rainbow Six Siege is kept updated by Ubisoft, getting regular updates that keep the game alive and expanding. That’s all well and good, but what is there for people playing the game on their own? Is there a campaign in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-story-mode">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have a Story Mode?</h2>



<p>There is no campaign in Rainbow Six Siege – and there never has been. It was a development decision made early on by Ubisoft, with the team opting to create a multiplayer-exclusive game that was devoid of a story mode. It was seen as a strange move by some, but it ultimately paid off, making Rainbow Six Siege one of the best multiplayer games ever.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t have a campaign, but it has plenty of missions to soak up. There’s also a spin-off title named Rainbow Six Extraction – that has a story to follow, but it’s leagues away from Rainbow Six Siege when it comes to a side-by-side comparison. </p>



<p>Many will argue that Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t <b>need</b> a campaign – it’s all about the multiplayer, and that’s what matters most.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rainbow-six-siege-solo">Can You Play Rainbow Six Siege Solo?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has a series of offline missions called ‘Situations’ that you can explore without any other player helping you out. In the solo play portion of the game, you can access various zones with any Operator in the game, picking your loadout and taking on a series of missions based on the game’s multiplayer map pool.</p>



<p>It’s a great way to learn the game’s ropes, mechanics, and maps – but it’s not a replacement for multiplayer. That’s where Rainbow Six Siege truly shines.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Rainbow Six Siege Have Cross Progression? (Answered)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression-answered.1085895/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rainbow Six Siege keeps going from strength to strength as Ubisoft, the game’s developer, keeps pumping it full of meaningful content updates. With a broad esports ecosystem, millions of players, and a solid multiplayer platform, Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most valuable games in the business. It’s a seamless enough game, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression</strong>?</p>



<p>For many modern multiplayer games, cross progression mechanics are pivotal to delivering a successful game. Many players are cross-platform gamers these days, which means they’ll likely play the same game on different platforms – PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Mobile. This is one of the most electrifying multiplayer titles in the industry, but does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression mechanics?</p>



<p>Let’s answer that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-have-cross-progression-features">Does Rainbow Six Have Cross Progression Features?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has seamless cross progression between every platform it exists on, ensuring players can recover their progress and keep up the fight no matter what platform they’re playing on. It’s done through the linking of a player’s Ubisoft account, which serves as the ‘middle man mechanic’ between these platforms. </p>



<p>There is a caveat though – certain statistics are shared on a limited basis. Three types of progress are only shared between Xbox and PlayStation or PC and Amazon Luna: Current Rank, Rank History, and Skill MMR. That means you’ll have a different skill rating on PlayStation compared to PC.</p>



<p>Aside from those elements, almost everything is available in Rainbow Six Siege on a cross progression basis. This is a feature that has existed since November 2022, and since then, it has been tried, tested, and approved by the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-crossplay">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>As of 2024, Rainbow Six Siege has a fully seamless ecosystem, allowing players on any platform to play with anyone else. That means that if you’re a PC gamer, you can connect with your friends playing Rainbow Six Siege on PlayStation 5, and vice-versa.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-cross-progression-on-rainbow-six-siege">How to unlock cross-progression on Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<p>To access cross-progression mechanics, you’ll need to be logged into the same Ubisoft account on the two (or more) platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘TikTok Will Be Forced to Go Dark’: Statement Issued Ahead of US TikTok Ban]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98tiktok-will-be-forced-to-go-dark%E2%80%99-statement-issued-ahead-of-us-tiktok-ban.1085889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ByteDance’s US representatives have issued a statement on social media ahead of the application’s impending shutdown on January 19. In the final days before the US TikTok ban, it has been stated that the only thing that can save the app now is the word of the Biden Administration, the very team that brought about TikTok’s imminent doom in 2024.</p>



<p>The US TikTok ban will impact 170 million users nationwide, including tens of thousands of gaming content creators who use the application to supplement their creation-based income streams.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-begin-the-countdown">Begin the Countdown</h2>



<p>Tomorrow, TikTok will be banned in the United States unless President Biden (and his team) issue a statement to ‘assure non-enforcement’. That’s not likely to happen.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1880424906820608180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent post</a> on social media, the TikTok team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok’s availability to over 170 million Americans. </p>



<p>Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed exactly how TikTok will be banned in the country, but it’s widely assumed that storefronts like Google Play and the iOS App Store will block downloads of the application. It’s also believed that geoblocking measures will be put in place to stop people in the United States from accessing TikTok via a browser.</p>



<p>The move comes amid a desire from the United States government to distance itself from Chinese companies. In recent days, the Pentagon placed Tencent on a ‘blacklist’, marking it as an organisation that requires heightened attention from security services. ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, is the parent company over the top of TikTok.</p>

On top of that, Nippon Ichi have made the categorically correct choice to let your save carry over into the main game. So, what I’m saying is, go and play the start of this game. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the sequel to the iconic original, Phantom Brave. Set in Ivoire, a area punctuated by diverse islands. You play Marona, an incredibly cheerful girl, especially considering she can talk to the souls of dead people. Where it comes in handy is that she can interact with Ash, a dead Chroma, or bounty hunter, who used to work with Marona’s parents. He’s now her protector, and together they set out to solve the islands’ problems, via the medium of strategy RPG action. It’s the perfect arrangement.</p>

<p>What’s particularly cool about Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero is the way it retains the character of the original game, while updating the visuals in a Chibi 3D art style. It’s certainly a great-looking game, with beautiful hi-res character artwork and chunky 3D visuals. Marona finds herself separated from Ash, and instead has to team up with Apricot, the ghost of a pirate ship captain’s daughter. I think you’ll be happily swept up in its ghost-ship centric tale when it launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC and Nintendo Switch on January 30th.</p>
