            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/</link>
            <guid>1377397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The final major update for Battlefield 6 - Season 1 has arrived with Winter Offensive, the third update that we knew little <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">about when we first previewed Season 1 back in October</a>. This update adds a new refresh of the Empire State map, turning New York into a frozen, snow-filled battlefield. It adds a new Ice Pick melee weapon, new limited-time game modes, and a whole host of tweaks and changes to the game.</p>



<p>The new limited-time Ice Lock version of the Empire State map is one of the highlights in the Winter Offensive update, as are the new limited-time multiplayer and gauntlet modes that pull players through variations of the Ice Lock Empire State map and introduce a new Freeze mechanic limited to the event.</p>



<p>There's also, of course, a new battle pass for players to work through, which is where you'll be able to unlock the Ice Pick melee weapon introduced with this update.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding changes to the game, update 1.1.3.0 includes improvements to hit registration "<em>across all situations that previously felt unreliable</em>," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0">a blog post on the official Battlefield website</a>. There's also enhanced close-range soldier visibility by way of stronger character highlights, refined weapon handling to help players be accurate with their shots more consistently, and improved reliability for some of the most-used gadgets in the game.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have also made a point to improve the game's audio across the board, update the layouts for Rush and Breakthrough maps, and strengthen vehicle clarity. </p>



<p>It's a fairly sizable update and a solid way to end off Season 1, since this is the final major piece of what we knew was coming in Season 1. So far, Battlefield 6 has been the shooter-of-the-year in 2025, taking the thunder that would have otherwise been held by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll see how well EA and Battlefield Studios can carry its momentum into the new year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has been spotted for something called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, which appears to pretty much confirm the long-mooted remake or remaster of the piratical open-world adventure.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a>, which puts the game at 18 for "violence", "bad language", and "in-game purchases" (because of course; this is Ubisoft we're talking about, after all) was spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pegi-rates-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>, but it's not the first we've heard of a potential <em>Black Flag </em>remake or remaster.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p72wmu/assassins_creed_black_flag_remake_resynced_leak/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">thequaliti</a> spotted text pointing to <em>Black Flag Resynced </em>within the localization table of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. Essentially, the text is a quick disclaimer discussing "creative liberties" taken with history to create the game, but it's another pretty strong piece of evidence, too.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>is probably getting a remake soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's precedent for this, too; in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot promised that "some remakes" of titles in the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>series were on the way, and that these projects would "revisit some of the games [Ubisoft has] created in the past and modernize them".</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>seems like a pretty solid candidate to kick off Ubisoft's slate of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>remakes, especially given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="85cef5b0-2392-4049-9109-bfdd7b8e3e95" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">grim fate</a> of the studio's other foray into nautical adventuring in recent years.</p><p>Still, I'd argue that remaking the original game, or perhaps <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>, would be a better shout. These are games with (in my eyes, at least) very clear flaws, so giving them another try and sanding down some of the more troublesome edges makes a lot of sense to me.</p><p><em>Black Flag</em>, by contrast, is still a very good game by today's standards, and as an avowed RPG-element-<em>Assassin's Creed </em>hater, I'm worried Ubisoft is going to drown the seafaring, swashbuckling classic in gear scores and incremental loot.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Given the increasing buzz around the so-called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, it may well be that we can expect an official announcement at The Game Awards, which is set to reward some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2025-nominees" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a925a006-6874-4d20-831b-d86ee39af97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its nominees</a> with shiny trophies later this week.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether that announcement surfaces or not.

            <p>
Ubisoft's long-rumoured Black Flag remake is seemingly even closer to reality after a listing for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted on the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) ratings board website.
</p>
<p>
Rumours of a Black Flag remake first surfaced back in 2023, when it was reported a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">new version of the celebrated 2013 open-world pirate game was in development at Ubisoft Singapore</a>, which was still embroiled in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>' protracted development at the time. The report claimed the remake was "in its earliest stages" and "at least a few years" away from release.
</p>
<p>
Four years later, the project still hasn't been officially announced (with Ubisoft perhaps keen to avoid a premature reveal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">another Sands of Time-style embarrassment</a>), but that hasn't stopped the evidence of its existence from piling up. Earlier this year, for instance, actor Matt Ryan - who played Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway - hinted at the remake's seemingly imminent arrival, only for Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">threaten him with legal action</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, something called Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced has <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1998398019352326187#m">appeared</a> (albeit seemingly briefly) on the PEGI website, rated 18 for violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. So is Resynced the long-rumoured Black Flag remake? Obviously, nothing is certain until it's official, but at this point - and with that name - it's harder to believe it isn't. And given Ubisoft recently confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">still had an "unannounced title" to launch before 31st March</a> next year, it's probably out very soon.
</p><p>
Which just leaves the small matter of an official announcement, and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s The Game Awards primed and ready to launch its annual assault of announcements, adverts, and Kojimas upon us this week, I know where I'll be pointing my eyes for likely Black Flag remake reveals.

<p>No platforms have been specified in the listing, so it's unknown at this time whether Switch 2 is on the cards, but after the recent launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, we reckon there's a high chance that Black Flag could follow.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_mUe1VPypgs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mUe1VPypgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_mUe1VPypgs" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_mUe1VPypgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mUe1VPypgs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3937e6ohkumw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>We're just a couple of days out from The Game Awards this week, so it seems highly likely that Ubisoft is planning to officially reveal the game during the upcoming event.</p>
<p>It's not the only thing that leaked from Geoff Keighley's awards bonanza, since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">Sony accidentally revealed</a> the existence of an unannounced character in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> before the game's planned appearance later this week.</p>
<p>Black Flag originally launches in 2013 and saw releases on both the Wii U and the Switch. It's frequently cited as one of the most popular entries in the series alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/assassins_creed_the_ezio_collection">Assassin's Creed II</a>, largely thanks to its excellent navel combat and more lighthearted narrative.</p>

			<p>The legal battle between Unknown Worlds co-founders Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire and Krafton over the development of Subnautica 2 has been one of the biggest surprise stories of the year for 2025. It's had several twists and turns, the most recent of which being <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-strikes-back-unknown-worlds-founders-sharing-files-racist-views-korea/">accusations of racist comments made by Cleveland towards Korea</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/">Krafton's chief executive officer asking ChatGPT if there was a way to avoid paying</a> Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">the $250 million bonus</a> that is at the heart of this battle.</p>



<p>If you've not been following along, there is a bullet-point list at the bottom of this article taking you through all of our coverage of the story so far. Today's latest update comes after recent testimony given by Unknown Worlds co-founders Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire during a trial from November 17-19, 2025, in the Delaware Court of Chancery. </p>



<p>These testimonies given by the co-founders and the evidence displayed at the trial, in Krafton's view, prove a couple of key things. Firstly, the evidence and testimony make it "<em>unequivocally clear there was no preconceived plan by Krafton to remove Unknown Worlds' leadership to avoid the earnout obligation</em>," as has been previously alleged by the co-founders. </p>



<p>Secondly, Krafton states that the testimony and evidence prove that the co-founders "<em>lied and tried to hide their abandonment [of Subnautica 2 and their duties] because they wanted KRAFTON to pay them hundreds of millions of dollars for nothing</em>."</p>



<p>According to Krafton's timeline of events, Cleveland and McGuire were hiding the fact that both of them were checked out from their work at Unknown Worlds on Subnautica 2 until Krafton found out on May 20, 2025, and prior to that date, Gill and other members of Unknown Worlds were being forced into awkward positions where they had to avoid telling Krafton the truth about Unknown Worlds' leadership situation in order to protect the earnout.</p>



<p>Krafton shared excerpts with Wccftech from the evidence and testimony presented, including statements attributed to Cleveland like "<em>I stopped working four months ago and have entered semi-retirement</em>," which Cleveland made on January 8, 2024, in a private message. Cleveland previously admitted that he no longer wanted to work at Unknown Worlds and that he was burned out, though during this trial process he has come back to say he is 'fired up now' and wants to return to work.</p>



<p>A statement shared that was attributed to McGuire emailing the core Unknown Worlds team regarding his title as technical director on January 10, 2024, reads, "<em>I've continued to do bits and pieces of the job as needed, but I stopped using that title years ago when I felt it no longer reflected my primary contribution to the company</em>."</p>



<p>Another statement attributed to McGuire in his personal log on April 29, 2024, reads, "<em>At home, I met with Charlie and Ted to let them know I'm quitting</em>," followed by a statement from Cleveland on the same day where Cleveland expresses sadness at McGuire leaving, and saying that he is "<em>pretty sure [he'll] be doing the same thing</em>."</p>



<p>A statement attributed to Subnautica 2 lead designer Anthony Gallegos seems to describe the frustrations felt by the rest of the Unknown Worlds team, with Gallegos claiming he "<em>can't even get Max [McGuire] to look at some code for [Subnautica 2] water to help us, but he'll make money off a sale from four years ago and get paid to do nothing</em>."</p>



<p>All of that feels pretty damning against Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, and their testimonies don't make their situation look any better. Per testimony from Cleveland, an email sent to Unknown Worlds staff titled "<em>Updates to Our Leadership Team's Roles and Responsibilities</em>" on August 5, 2024, excluded employees from Krafton. Cleveland did not confirm that Gill intentionally excluded Krafton staff, only that no one from Krafton was listed in the email.</p>



<p>Cleveland also admitted in his testimony that he did not directly tell Krafton CEO, Changham Kim, about his disengagement from work at Unknown Worlds. When Krafton's representation put to Cleveland, "<em>You stood to gain potentially tens of millions of dollars more in earnout, and you couldn't send him [Changham Kim] an email because your arms were hurting? Is that your testimony?"</em> Cleveland responded, "<em>That's not a great reason, I admit</em>."</p>



<p>Cleveland also admitted that Changham Kim "<em>seemed alarmed</em>" when he told Kim that he was "<em>no longer involved in Subnautica at all</em>," and could not provide Kim with an update on the state of the game's development.</p>



<p>A further statement from Gill, taken from an audio transcription of a June 10, 2025, call, reads, "<em>If you [Krafton] want to delay the game, just pay it. Just pay the earnout...agree to pay it now, we can sign something tomorrow...it'll be paid, and we'll give you flexibility on paying it. You can pay it over two years, instead of all at once. But just pay it</em>."</p>



<p>With all of the evidence presented last month at the Delaware Court of Chancery and testimonies from the co-founders, Krafton holds firm in its claim that the co-founders<em> "were always concerned first and foremost about the earnout</em>."</p>



<p>We'll continue to update you on this story as it progresses, though this latest batch of evidence seems to be a huge blow to the co-founders' chances of winning the case.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>



<li>On September 24, new motions from Krafton alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/">the founders stole what Krafton called "<em>effectively, a blueprint</em>"</a> for Subnautica in an attempt to further its argument that the co-founders intended to release Subnautica 2 on their own.</li>



<li>On November 18, the co-founders and their legal team allege that Krafton's plan to avoid paying the $250 million earnout <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/">was codenamed "<em>Project X</em>" internally within Krafton, and Krafton's chief executive officer, Changham Kim, asked ChatGPT</a> how to avoid paying Unknown Worlds the $250 million bonus.</li>



<li>On November 20, Krafton claimed that co-founder <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-strikes-back-unknown-worlds-founders-sharing-files-racist-views-korea/">Charlie Cleveland made racist comments regarding Korea in his preparation notes for the litigation</a> between Cleveland, his fellow co-founders, and Krafton, and that Cleveland said, "<em>history will remember that Krafton was bad</em>."</li>

<p>As you can see in the trailer above, Better Than Us casts you as a master thief whose goal is to infiltrate the swanky parties of the year 2200's richest bastards and manipulate them into looking the other way as you swipe some of their stuff. There's some stealthing, but as you might expect of a game that lists The Count of Monte Cristo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, and the works of Terry Pratchett as prominently among its inspirations as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a>, your words will be your most formidable weapon.</p>
<p>Lying is key, but you've got to do it properly. "Tell different stories to different people," the game's blurb reads. "Remember who you told what. Build a web of deception so intricate that even the powerful can't see through it. But slip up once—contradict yourself, forget a detail—and everything unravels."</p><p>For all its setting in futuristic floating cities built to save their wealthy inhabitants from the climate change-ravaged Earth below, Little Bat Games make clear that this isn't a cartoonish flight of fancy. Better Than Us' Steam description reveals that it's been "developed in consultation with historians from Oxford, UC Davis, and the University of Florida". The game "deals heavily with issues of extreme wealth inequality and faith. It explores philosophical underpinnings of class oppression, effects of climate change on underprivileged populations, and refugees. It also addresses sexual and gender issues, artificial intelligence, and faith in historical contexts".</p>
<p>"Looking to the past is a helpful way of examining modern issues," Little Bat creative director and voice actor Cyrus Nemati says of the studio's approach. "Not only is the historical record inspiring, but dead people are less able to sue small game studios." He and fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> alum Sarah Grayson - the pair voiced Ares and Selene respectively - lead Better Than Us' cast.</p>
<p>As someone who loves a good bit of stealth and weaving wordly webs in the likes of Pentiment, if Little Bat can strike that balance in entertaining fashion while offering plenty of freedom in the way you go about prying the possessions from a set of faithfully-rendered fat cats, I can see myself having a ball with this one.</p>
<p>For now, Better Than Us has a 2026 release window and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3954390/Better_Than_Us/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week saw a spate of accusations of AI use in video games, ones where developer denials took strange turns when even the studios or individuals accused couldn’t say for sure they hadn’t used AI. The case of both <em>Fortnite</em>’s new sprays and a swiftly announced-then-cancelled <em>Postal</em> game are the latest signs of how the specter of AI is ruining all of our lives.</p><p>Last week, publisher Running With Scissors announced a new game in the <em>Postal</em> series, called <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise</em>. Viewers swiftly began lobbing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/developer-of-new-postal-game-shuts-down-studio-after-game-was-announced-then-canceled-over-gen-ai-allegations?ref=aftermath.site"><u>accusations of AI</u></a> at the game’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Af1TA0Am1U&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">announcement trailer</a>, which has since been pulled down, accusations that developer Goonswarm Games denied. People highlighted concern over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdenph/rws_using_ai_is_incredibly_disappointing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sprites’ mouths</u></a> in the trailer and an apparently suspicious <a href="https://x.com/LunetaleVT/status/1996457896339710174?ref=aftermath.site"><u>speedpaint</u></a> Running With Scissors released, but none of it featured the telltale too-many-fingers or other undeniable signs.&nbsp;</p><p>On December 5, Goonswarm announced that the whole thing had gotten so out of hand that they were closing the studio, writing on <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Twitter</u></a>, “Our studio was mistakenly accused of using AI-generated art in our games, and every attempt to clarify our work only escalated the situation… It’s tough to pour so much energy into a game and end up caught in the middle of an AI war by accident. We’ve decided to shut down the studio and end all future activities.”</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve shut down the studio <a href="https://t.co/tbW2f2VQxL?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/tbW2f2VQxL</a></p>— Goonswarm Games (@goonswarmgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>I am a person who has zero interest in a <em>Postal</em> game, much less in 2025, but I found watching it all unfold concerning. If Goonswarm had used AI, it seemed unlikely to me that they would deny it so strenuously–what would be the point of lying like this, much less sticking to the lie so intently that you’d close the studio? I wondered if this wasn’t some new version of AI brainrot, where the bullshit technology has been forced down our throats so much that we can’t help but see it everywhere, just as its most strenuous boosters hope.</p><p>But then, on December 6, Goonswarm <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>returned to Twitter</u></a> with an update. It turns out that after “conducting an internal review, we agree with your criticism. The promo art does appear to include or be influenced by AI-generated material.” Goonswarm wrote that “We collaborated with external artists for years and never saw any sign of this” and that the files they received from these external artists “always looked legitimate within our internal pipeline, which is why our initial reaction was to protect our team and defend our innocence. We understand now that your concerns were valid. And we take responsibility for not catching this earlier.” The studio wrote that this possible AI use only extended to the game’s promo art, and that it will “replace all disputed promo art across our projects with pieces created entirely by human artists.” The studio concluded by writing, “We never intended to mislead anyone, and our earlier statements reflected what we honestly believed at the moment.”</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/UR5g4rxJxz?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/UR5g4rxJxz</a></p>— Goonswarm Games (@goonswarmgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Running With Scissors followed up on <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1998068355593630181?ref=aftermath.site"><u>December 10</u></a> to say that while it had “needed to cut ties with Goonswarm Games on Friday and state the reason for doing so, our broken trust, we still wanted to give Goonswarm the time and space to be transparent about what had occurred… We wish them all the best as we both move forward our separate ways.”</p><p>The idea that an outside artist used AI and didn’t disclose it to the studio is more plausible than Goonswarm riding a lie into the ground, and highlights the insidious nature of AI’s forced ubiquity–how can you <em>ever</em> trust it isn’t being used? The situation bears some similarities to another AI dustup earlier last week, involving <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103?ref=aftermath.site"><u>accusations of AI use in some new <em>Fortnite</em> sprays</u></a>. Fans were already on edge about AI in Epic games over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/831747/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-steam-game-stores-made-with-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>comments</u></a> Tim Sweeney made that “AI will be involved in nearly all future [games] production,” and the sprays in question definitely have the signs, including the telltale too many toes. Other accusations centered on some in-game music.&nbsp;</p><p>The freelance artist of one of the sprays responded to the accusations on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andthankyou/p/DRstwipDuxw/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Instagram</u></a>, but rather than clearing things up, they made the situation even <em>more</em> confusing. They wrote that “I think the culprit is a clock in the background. I grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them. The numbers are bad, entirely possible I grabbed an AI clock and wasn’t paying attention.” Epic has yet to comment on the situation.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Putting aside the idea that a whole cadre of professionals might not notice an AI <em>clock</em>, a ubiquitous and straightforward object that is designed to be easy to gauge the accuracy of, this response highlights a deeper problem with AI. Even if an individual isn’t actively using it, it’s increasingly easy for it to slip in under our noses if we’re not constantly on alert. As AI becomes more convincing, and as it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><u>forced into more and more places</u></a>, even if we aren’t trying to engage with AI, we can’t be sure we haven’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s no wonder that widespread paranoia over all this has taken hold. If even the people making things can’t be sure they aren’t using AI (or at least claim they aren’t sure), how can their audience be confident? And while vigilance is healthy and warranted, what does it mean–especially these days–when we feel like we can’t trust <em>anything</em> we see? False accusations of AI use can harm a person’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/style/ai-chatgpt-turnitin-students-cheating.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>academic</u></a> or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisstokelwalker/art-subreddit-illustrator-ai-art-controversy?ref=aftermath.site"><u>artistic</u></a> career, and it’s also just bad for all of our souls and brains to be constantly on high alert. It makes us prone to distrust and dismissiveness, leaving us less open to other people’s creative works and making it harder for them to share it, especially if they’re still developing their skills. AI is already eroding trust, and our heightened suspicion can make us hostile not just to the work, but to each other. It’s not good for creators or their audiences to live like this, and it’s certainly not a good environment for anyone to try to make things in.</p><p><em>But</em>! “Let’s all show each other some grace, huh?” is not a lesson I can impart to you in the situations above, both of which prove that suspicion <em>was</em> warranted and that the accusations might have been correct. If anything, they suggest that even <em>more</em> suspicion is called for, when the people denying AI use themselves might not even know if they can truthfully deny it. So <em>now</em> how are you supposed to live, pinned between the slow spiritual death of thinking everyone around you is full of shit and the world-eating encroachment of the full-of-shit machine?&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, I don’t know. As we wait for the AI bubble to gloriously burst and all of this to go the way of NFTs and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai-metaverse/"><u>metaverse</u></a>, I think the best we can do is remember who our common enemy is: the AI companies and the people who stand to get rich off the tech, who <em>need</em> us to believe all of this is inevitable. We can double down on our commitment to proving them wrong, refuting their bullshit claims and making our displeasure known when AI products get forced into our tools without our consent. No one wants to take the extra time to make sure some reference art or a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/ai-author-articles-wired-business-insider?ref=aftermath.site"><u>freelance pitch</u></a> isn’t AI (ask me how I know!), but maybe we can motivate ourselves by seeing it as one more way to tell the Sam Altmans of the world to get fucked. It wouldn’t prevent the situations above, and it doesn’t help us navigate a world increasingly full of AI slop, but it can at least be a small act of resistance against their shit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Trainers around the world will be returning to Lumiose City tomorrow as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> DLC drops on 10th December. But there's plenty more to look forward to than just new Megas — some major returning Mega Evolutions have also been confirmed, including a headlining trio.</p>
<p>Earlier today, alongside the announcement of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-mystery-gift-code-list">Mystery Gift 'mon</a>, The Pokémon Company revealed that Sceptile, Blaziken, and Swampert will be getting their Mega Stones very soon.</p>
<p>However, similar to the Kalos trio's stones, the Sceptilite, Blazikenite, and Swampertite Stones will only be available via the Z-A Battle Club's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-battles-all-seasons-and-rewards">Ranked Battles</a>. Which means you need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to get them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="464a0329e0ab6"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/464a0329e0ab6/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>These three stones will be available ink ranked season 5 (Sceptilite), season 6 (Swampertite), and season 7 (Blazikenite) and you don't need the DLC to get the stones. You will, however, apparently encounter these Pokémon <em>in</em> Mega Dimension.</p>
<p>The date for the new seasons hasn't been confirmed yet, but we'll let you know when, as we're sure you'll want this excellent trio of Megas on your team.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something a little more immediate, then you'll notice that most of the trailer up top focuses on Alpha Charizard, which you can get via a new Mystery Gift code. It'll make a very spicy Mega Charizard X or Y, we reckon.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Are you excited for the Mega Dimension DLC tomorrow? Will you be getting these three Mega Stones? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

Today, the development team has provided a new look at some of the game's standout features ahead of the launch of the Alpha version later this month.</p>



<p>Today's new screenshots, which can be found below, provide a new look at the party members, the detailed environments, combat sequences, and the first look at the mind map powering the detective gameplay, which I found to be among the most interesting additions to the experience when I had the chance of seeing the game in action during this year's Gamescom.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the new batch of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy precedes the launch of the game's Alpha version, which will debut on December 16 on Steam. This early version of the game allows players to test out some of the game's features, including the tactical turn-based combat system and the investigative features that suit the Inquisitor protagonist well, while helping Owlcat with the game's development.</p>



<p>Although it may not look that much different from its predecessor at a glance, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy packs a lot of improvements and new features that will set the two games apart. Combat, in particular, has been significantly enhanced, with an overhaul of the cover system and a new targeting system that opens up numerous tactical options.

            <p>Look lively, me hearties. There, cast your eyes starboard. Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced PEGI rating ahoy. The fair winds have seemed to be blowing our sails towards Ubisoft's long-rumoured remake or remaster of the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, the one that's all piratey, for years at this point. At last, it seems, we may be on track to slide our hull into its port.</p>
<p>Our compasses have endured much flitting between different directions, buffetted by the rogue gusts of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">voice actors saying a thing</a> and many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports also saying things</a>. The seasick landlubbers among us may indeed finally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">breathe their sigh of relief very soon</a> after all, it would seem.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That said, if you're hoping this <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced">freshly unearthed listing</a> on the Pan European Game Information ratings board's website is awash with details about Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced, you're going to be disappointed. Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">YouTuber Corkben</a>, the listing's naught but a name, an indication that you'll have to be 18 to play this Ubisoft-developed game, and a selection of reasons that rating's been applied.
</p>
<p>Violence, bad language, and the most piratey of all infractions: in-game purchases. Some combination of the same trio adorns <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=assassin%27s+creed&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-bz8nbznbz_F9jMJ_MJXFYGrsaKZAZWOHaA9gS6afh1Y&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">the listings</a> of all the other Assassin's Creed entries, though those have some additional blurb about platforms and release dates that the Black Flag Resynced rating is currently missing. The timing might suggest a a formal announcement at this Thursday's Geoff Awards, something that'd seem to mesh with recent reporting alleging a release early next year.</p><div>

<p>This year's seen plenty of Black Flag remake chatter, regardless of Ubisoft continuing to remain tight lipped on the subject, as they have since such a project was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">first reported to be in the works</a>. Back in September, French publication Jeux Vidéo Magazine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">claimed</a> that Ubisoft Singapore, Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are involved in putting together the remake. The magazine also asserted that this Black Flag revamp will ditch with the original's modern-day Abstergo office-wandering segments for some cut content featuring Mary Read. The likes of inventory and combat mechanics have reportedly been tweaked to more closely mirror recent entries Shadows and Valhalla.</p>
<p>So, hoist the main sail! We're headed for remake-laden land at last. Or just an island covered in fools' gold.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Exclusive: CD Projekt-Backed Cyberpunk TCG Revealed, Featuring Characters From 2077 and Edgerunners — Here's Everything You Need to Know]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-tcg-revealed</link>
            <guid>1377277</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The brainchild of Mike Pondsmith back in 1988 as a TTRPG, Cyberpunk as a property has exploded in the past decade, thanks in no small part to CD Projekt Red and 2020's release of their first-person RPG, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Now, five years and expansions, patches, and board games later, the world of Cyberpunk is trying its robotic hands in a brand new – and highly competitive – market with a fully fledged, and collectible, <strong>Cyberpunk: Trading Card Game</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has had the opportunity to speak with the teams at WeirdCo and CD Projekt Red, who are working on the newly announced TCG, to get a better understanding of the designers at WeirdCo, how this partnership came to be, and even some goodies about the game itself. We've also got an <strong>exclusive first look</strong> at key card art from the Cyberpunk TCG <strong>(flip through the gallery below)</strong>, featuring Cyberpunk 2077's Saburo and Yorinobu Arasaka, and their handy bodyguard, Goro Takemura. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WeirdCo, a new face in the world of TCGs, has been working in close partnership with CDPR themselves to devise this new card game, aiming to capture the tone and aesthetic of 2077 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners">Edgerunners' Netflix anime</a>, to deliver a game that doesn't just feel like another TCG just with a coat of Cyberpunk yellow overtop. One way the team is doing this is by working with high-profile artists, both internal to CDPR and the wider community, to deliver gorgeous card art featuring faces that will be familiar to anyone worth their wait in Chrome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with Elliot Cook (WeirdCo President) and Luohan Wei (WeirdCo CEO), both co-founders of the business, I wanted to know how this new studio came about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliot began, "WeirdCo was formed when Luohan and I met each other through our mutual mentor, Bill Mooney: a true legend in the digital gaming space. We immediately hit it off over our passion for building games that truly connect with their communities. Later, we formed WeirdCo to create games together — ones that authentically bring together and inspire people." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Players can look forward to collecting an array of unique variants of characters including V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Adam Smasher, and more."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"CD Projekt Red has a similar goal, and when we saw this in each other we knew it would be a great partnership. What has been paramount, and the question we ask ourselves daily, is “how do we make a game that represents and celebrates every part of Cyberpunk — everywhere it has been and everywhere it is going?" That is the north star of our development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Cyberpunk being one of the biggest media properties right now, I was curious how a brand new group could tackle such a monster IP, but despite it being a new team, the group working on the Cyberpunk TCG has worked on other large IP card games you probably have heard of. "We at WeirdCo have direct experience working on some great card games" Elliot explains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Marvel Snap, Duel Masters, and Universus, to name a few. At our core we are disruptors, just like CD Projekt Red, and we both strive to inspire our players. We saw this in each other from the beginning, and I think CD Projekt Red saw our love for the Cyberpunk 2077 universe too. This is an IP that deserves to be explored in different and exciting ways, and we’re committed to doing this authentically with Cyberpunk TCG, side by side with the community."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of CD Projekt Red, they have been a constant ally during the game’s design and development. Elliot provides further details, "We have worked with CD Projekt Red very closely since the beginning of development. They have been the ideal partner; you may even see the same amazing artists who worked on Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and more as featured artists in Cyberpunk TCG! Every part of the TCG has the impeccable RED touch, ensuring this is a completely authentic Cyberpunk experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cyberpunk TCG won’t be CDPR’s first collaboration in the tabletop space, with other titles like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review"><u>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City</u></a> and <a href="https://review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone Board Game</u></a>, but I was curious what unique joys or challenges came from working on a TCG, so I asked Patrick Mills, CDPR’s Franchise Content Strategy Lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every collaboration is unique, and we’re lucky to work with many partners who are passionate and extremely dedicated to their crafts. While making a physical TCG is something completely new for us, we see the genuine excitement, enthusiasm, and talent in WeirdCo that act as the foundation of any successful collaboration." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Their passion for the franchise has been evident at every stage, and they’re doing an incredible job developing an engaging TCG that ensures an authentic Cyberpunk experience. On the flip side, many of us at CD Projekt Red are huge TCG enthusiasts too — so we’re thrilled to be entering this space with WeirdCo"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that is clear is that both teams at WeirdCo and CDPR are taking care to ensure that this is faithful to the Cyberpunk property that its creator, Mike Pondsmith, imagined back in 1988. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"For the initial release, our primary goal is to represent the core identity of Cyberpunk 2077"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want Cyberpunk TCG to be authentic to the spirit and dynamic nature of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, and wanted to create a TCG that is accessible to Cyberpunk fans who have never touched a card game.” Luohan says, “At the same time, as TCG players ourselves, we wanted our game to have the depth necessary to entertain for a long, long time. And I think we have struck that balance well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliot continues, "The best part of this job is spending hundreds of hours with the Cyberpunk universe — whether that’s replaying Cyberpunk 2077, watching Edgerunners for the fifth time, or reading all the Dark Horse comics. Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation. At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: "How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fan favorite characters will be making an appearance as well in this TCG and picking who would be included in this first set was a big decision. "For the initial release, our primary goal is to represent the core identity of Cyberpunk 2077 by featuring many of its most iconic and beloved characters,” explains Patrick. “We’ve collaborated closely with WeirdCo to ensure that the artwork and flavor of every card faithfully captures the essence of who they represent, providing a snapshot of their personalities and what they stand for, as well as including memorable moments players will instantly recognize. Given the complexity of our characters, we wanted to capture their many facets across multiple cards. So, players can look forward to collecting an array of unique variants of characters including V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Adam Smasher, and more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the WeirdCo side, Elliot shares, "We worked very hard to figure out which Legends make the most sense for players, and which ones make the most sense for the overall theme of Set 1. While some of them, like V and Johnny, are obvious hits, we have a few surprises up our sleeves too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being a game composed of a ton of cards, artwork is pretty important in a TCG and WeirdCo is special care to make sure that what players can expect is nothing short of beautiful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve been working for a long time with a team of over 20 talented artists for Set 1, and are excited to explore new ways of bringing the world of Cyberpunk to life through our card art. Working with artists like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itoscaresme/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ito</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vincenzo_riccardi_vinartwork/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincenzo Riccardi</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jsraphael_/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Raphael</a>, who each bring their own unique flair to the project, makes each card more exciting than the last," Elliot continues, "We’re not sharing gameplay details yet, so there’s not too much I can say. But Cyberpunk is known for its beautiful yet tragic atmosphere — this is a major focus of ours when it comes to the card art."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on how Cyberpunk TCG will work remain shrouded behind CDPR's and WeirdCo's firewalls, so we have a bit yet before we have an in-depth picture of how it plays. Cyberpunk's TCG will be launching its crowdfunding campaign in 2026, which is right around the corner. WeirdCo and CDPR will be revealing more of the game soon, along with a deep dive into how the game plays, more artwork, and card reveals, with some more special reveals found only here on IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The TCG space is pretty crowded with new contenders entering the ring, it seems like every quarter or so, but few have the name recognition behind them like WeirdCo has with Cyberpunk. The fact that this project has so much support from CD Projekt Red behind it puts it in a different league from others, even before it's out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The excitement from the designers is electric, with Luohan leaving players with this, “I can’t wait for players to see how we’ve adapted the themes of Cyberpunk, like taking on gigs or building a crew, to a trading card game format. I think it is both true to Cyberpunk itself while being innovative to the TCG market as a whole; it’s a perfect combination in this way.” As far as I know, no other TCG lets you play with Keanu Reeves, so that is already a big plus in its favor. Wake up, Samurai, there's a whole new way to burn the city coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds up your alley, follow the game and get yourself a special and exclusive Lucy "Nova Rare" card free by signing up over on the game's <a href="https://www.launchoracle.com/weird-co/cyberpunk-trading-card-game/MF7J3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launch Oracle page</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

                <p>Evidence of a remake or remaster of the fan-favorite Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is solidifying, with a listing from European content-rating board PEGI emerging.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI listing</a>, the re-release of the Ubisoft classic is titled Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced, and it unsurprisingly has an 18 adults-only rating for violence, language, and in-game purchases. Ratings are generally a sign that a title's release is imminent.</p><p>"Resynced" is an amusing subtitle for a re-release, most likely referring to the in-universe Animus virtual reality machine that lets the player character experience historical events through an avatar, "syncing" them with memories of someone else from that time period. If you really want to make a stretch, "Resynced" could be a nautical pun.</p><p>The existence of this Black Flag revisit has been an open secret in the industry for years, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-coming/1100-6515623/" data-ref-id="1100-6515623">leaks dating back to 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-hints-at-a-potential-black-flag-remake/1100-6532817/" data-ref-id="1100-6532817">voice actors hinting</a> about the project. Per reports as recent as this November, the Black Flag remake <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-may-reportedly-launch-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6536439/" data-ref-id="1100-6536439">may launch on the week of March 23, 2026</a>.</p><p>Still unclear is if Black Flag Resynced is a straight remaster, similar to the treatment the Ezio trilogy and Assassin's Creed III received (with the latter simply titled "Assassin's Creed III Remastered"). "Resynced" could imply new or changed content for Black Flag--it's already been reported that this re-release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">won't feature any modern-day sections</a>, which would be a major change from the original game.</p><p>Should Black Flag Resynced surface in early 2026, it will be a nice drop for Assassin's Creed fans, who recently learned that the latest title in the franchise, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/" data-ref-id="1100-6536570">won't get a second major DLC</a>.</p>
