<p>“Since Virtua Fighter 5 REVO’s launch, we’ve heard your requests for multiplatform support via the official VF Discord and other channels We on the development team want to give users on all platforms the opportunity to enjoy Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, so we are happy to bring you this announcement.”</p>

<p>Even more content will be added, so that this is more than a simple port, with details of this to come in a future Virtua Fighter update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/12/theres-a-doom-themed-slayeux-tapestry-hanging-at-the-royal-armouries-in-leeds-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> launching this week on 15th May (and advance access for Deluxe Edition from tomorrow), Bethesda has teamed up with the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds for a rather unique week-long event inspired by the game.</p>
<p>Behold, the “Slayeux Tapestry” at the heart of the ‘Welcome to the Dark Ages’ exhibit, which you can visit for free until Friday 16th May – <a href="https://royalarmouries.org/leeds/whats-on/slayeux-tapestry-doom-the-dark-ages.">head here for more information</a>.</p>



<p>The Slayeux Tapestry is an 11-metre hand-stitched display that depicts some of the battles that will feature in DOOM: The Dark ages, featuring the demons and monsters that you’ll face in combat. It’s inspired by the famed Bayeux Tapestry, in case you didn’t get the pun, which depicts the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. You really can’t get much more medieval than that, can you?</p>
<p>It’s the work of French illustrator Simon De Thuillières, who said, ‘It was a huge honour to reimagine the brutal saga of the DOOM Slayer through this medieval lens. I take a lot of inspiration from videogames, so transforming the Slayer’s epic battles into a tapestry steeped in medieval style was both a challenge and a thrill. I can’t wait to hear what fans think of the blend of history and hellfire.”</p>

<p>Florence Symington, Director of Brand and Audiences for the Royal Armouries: “We’re absolutely delighted to be partnering with Bethesda and the DOOM team, hosting this innovative new exhibition amongst our historic collection of arms and armour. We are always seeking ways to share our expertise and reach more people than ever before. Welcome to the Dark Ages offers a rare and exciting opportunity to engage new audiences with the rich heritage, artistry and history of arms and armour. Across the exhibition, visitors will get a fascinating insight into how centuries-old craftsmanship has influenced the weaponry and design of DOOM: The Dark Ages.”</p>
<p>The Welcome to the Dark Ages also dives into the weaponry you’ll use to rip and tear through the game, while venturing into the rest of the Royal Armouries lets you explore all manner of historical weapons, armours and objects. The exhibits include&nbsp;Japanese samurai armour and swords, famous movie props, the armours of Henry VIII, and the armour for an Indian war elephant.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a cracking new entry in the iconic FPS franchise, visiting a different period in the Doom Slayer’s long history of demon battling. Stepping back to a Dark Ages-infused sci-fi period, there’s still plenty of exotic and technical weaponry, but you also now wield a chainsaw shield, have a gun that fires shards of skulls, and more.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">our DOOM: The Dark Ages review</a>, Miguel said, “DOOM: The Dark Ages is a fun and flashy shooter stuffed with engaging content – it’s a thrill-ride from beginning to end. In the shadow of DOOM Eternal, though, the more varied set-pieces and methodical combat cause its flame to burn just a bit less bright than I was hoping for.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-25</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-profits-down-despite-strong-sales-for-new-and-older-games.1186854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that its profits have fallen overall when compared to last year's figure, despite "strong" performances for releases like Atlus'&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Royal</em>.</p>

<p>In the legendary Japanese company's latest financial report, Sega reveals that its profit fell by around 17% compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-pachislots" rel="nofollow">last year's number</a>, although it's worth noting that its "entertainment" division (which comprises video games, but also movies and TV) actually saw profits rise.</p>

<p>Sega puts the increase in entertainment profit down to "strong performance" in various areas, including back catalog sales and revenue for the latest&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie, which helped the movie adaptations of the Blue Blur's adventures cumulatively cross $1 billion at the box office <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-profits-sonic-movies-shadow.jpg?itok=WqI4_tk1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-profits-sonic-movies-shadow.jpg?itok=kquuV3Fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies are doing pretty well for Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in entertainment, Sega points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">"strong" sales</a> of new IP&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, developed by ex-<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>staffers, as a motivating factor for increased profits in the sector. High sales for flagship&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>were also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">part of the studio's strength</a> in this area.</p>

<p>The company also says that "strong repeat sales" for back catalog titles&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Royal (Remaster)&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>helped to shore up its numbers in the entertainment department.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Sega doesn't report any figures on this front, so we don't know exactly where these titles stand in terms of numbers. We do, however, know that Atlus contributed 33 billion yen to its parent's figures for this year, with&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>putting 32.5 billion in the pot.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon</em>, another key studio franchise, put 11.5 billion yen in Sega's coffers, with sales of the most recent entry&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>being "steady", according to the company. This year also marked the release of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/like-dragon-yakuza-review-yakuza-tv-show-with-ip-paintjob" rel="nofollow">live-action show based on the IP</a>, although Sega doesn't say how well it did.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-financials.jpg?itok=jiw42NiF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-financials.jpg?itok=n7QUgu_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>are "steady", according to Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>All of these games helped somewhat to offset the costs incurred by the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">announced back in February</a> due to Sega and Sports Interactive's desire to focus instead on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>.</p>

<p>The entertainment sector's figures also helped somewhat to offset sharp losses in the pachinko and pachislot departments, although not quite to the degree of ensuring a rise in profits for the company, unfortunately.</p>

<p>It's also worth remembering that Sega's references to "gaming" throughout its financial report don't signify video games; rather, they're referring to casino gaming under the Sammy brand, and profits were actually up slightly under that umbrella as well.</p>

<p>That being said, Hawk said he'll make it his mission to "campaign all I can" to make it happen. But ultimately, Hawk said Activision will get to make the call.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> arrives later this week, and with physical editions now out in the wild, fans are expressing dismay amid reports the PS5 release includes just 85MB of data on the disc, with the Xbox Series X/S release seemingly not much bigger.
</p>
<p>
Rumblings of discontent over Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/some-retailers-have-broken-doom-the-dark-ages-street-date-and-huge-spoilers-are-already-out-there">over the weekend</a>, after one early receiver took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/nilynix/status/1920550232414183648">report the Xbox version contained just 342MB of data on the disc</a>. That was followed by an update on the PS5 version from Does it play?, an account dedicated to "[testing] commercial releases to ensure they work internet free."
</p>
<p>
Does it Play? <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920754796463636713">shared screenshots from a supporter</a> purportedly showing Doom: The Dark Ages' PS5 physical release contains just an 85.01MB "stub and a blocker to go online and update" on disc. That means purchasers of either console's physical edition are required to download approximately 85GB of data to play the game.

<p>
Images of Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920542970668826913">show an "internet required" badge on the cover</a>, but the extent of the required download size seemingly isn't made clear. Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda for confirmation of the reports, and for clarity on its physical release strategy, but the publisher is yet to respond. We'll update the story if we hear more.
</p>
<p>
The news follows similar criticism by players and preservationists earlier this year after Bethesda released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> with just 20GB of the game's full 120GB install size on the disc. Nintendo has also seen pushback after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">announcing physical game-key cards for Switch 2</a> that only include a download key. Early signs have suggested a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">significant majority of third-party publishers will release their Switch 2 titles on game-key cards at launch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Away from Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release controversy, Bethesda's latest has received plenty of praise. Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan called it "brisk and playful" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">four star review</a>, while Digital Foundry described it as "phenomenal" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-series-x-delivers-the-smoothest-experience-ps5-pro-the-crispest-image">their tech breakdown</a>.

			<p>A port of Grand Theft Auto IV for current generation consoles may release this year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921889318588567785%7Ctwgr%5E82c5c40957329ef83365f87a424dd45beb955192%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fvideotechuk_%2Fstatus%2F1921889318588567785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@videotechuk_</a> on X, well-known Rockstar leaker Tez2 recently revealed that someone at Rockstar hinted at a port of the fourth entry in the series in the past, and by now, it should have been in development for a year. This port could be released before the end of 2025, and this is one of the reasons the Liberty City Preservation Project, which recreated the entirety of the Grand Theft Auto IV main city in GTA V, was taken down, alongside other unspecified existing reasons.</p>
<p>The fourth entry in the popular open-world series may not be the only now-classic game developed by Rockstar Games that could be released on modern systems in the future. According to Tez2, if Rockstar Games continues to follow its older plans, a modern port of Max Payne 3 could follow the Grand Theft Auto IV port, giving Take-Two the opportunity to release a bundle or Definitive Edition coinciding with the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> in the works by Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">According to Tez, the long anticipated GTAIV port appears to be in-development for current-gen consoles per his source.</p>
<p>He believes Max Payne 3 will follow after. <a href="https://t.co/jpKrpiK1Fo">pic.twitter.com/jpKrpiK1Fo</a></p>
<p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1921889318588567785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the past, we have heard multiple times that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-remastered-2023/">Grand Theft Auto IV would return to modern consoles</a>, but neither ports nor remasters have materialized, so we have to take what Tez2 revealed with a grain of salt. Given how Grand Theft Auto VI has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">delayed to May 2026</a>, however, Rockstar Games and Take-Two now have a window of opportunity to still give fans of the series something that could tide them over until the launch of the next entry in the franchise. Hopefully, this port will receive better treatment than the disappointing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition collection.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-review-bomb-shut-down-thomas-mahler<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thomas Mahler, the head of&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Blind Forest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>developer Moon Studios, has claimed that the latter being "review bombed" could mean his studio will "have to shut down".</p>

<p>Speaking on the official&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>Discord (via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/ori-and-the-blind-forest-studio-head-says-they-might-shut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>), Mahler says that players who are enjoying the game should leave a positive review, because if they don't, a "review bomb" could lead "to people not buying the game", which in turn would mean Moon Studios is "not making any money".</p>

<p>The review bomb in question appears to refer to negative reviews on&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>'s Steam page, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Abo-Ibrahim/recommended/1371980/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some of which</a> point to the developer's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020099492/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anti-"woke" political positions</a>. Mahler says that if players want to see&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>finished, it's "detrimental" (sic; I assume he means "essential") that the review score be improved.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1921646282726138116" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">response</a>, Mahler says that in fact, "pretty much everyone" who's played&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>following recent hotfix patches was "extremely positive", and that the Discord post containing his comments was left up "to push back against some of the bullshit reviews".</p>

<p>Mahler goes on to say that while Moon Studios is "not in immediate financial danger", he should be "allowed to speak up" about issues within the industry that he finds "unbecoming", referring to apparent calls to review bomb&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>because "according to those folks, [Mahler is] a Nazi".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/almost-200-overwatch-developers-form-new-union-with-cwa.1186803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-overwatch-union<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over 200 staffers on Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>franchise have formed a new wall-to-wall union under the banner of the Communications Workers of America, becoming the latest Blizzard outfit to do so.</p>

<p>Per an official <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the CWA website, the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>Gamemakers Guild (OWGG) includes "game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance".</p>

<p>It's the latest union to be formed as part of the wider Activision Blizzard organization. Others include a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">union of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, which was Blizzard's first of its kind, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" rel="nofollow">unionized group of employees</a> at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>developer (and Activision subsidiary) Raven Software.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-owgg.jpg?itok=IGYcDeMA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-owgg.jpg?itok=BWUS5tHg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A group of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>developers have unionized, becoming the latest Blizzard staffers to do so.</figcaption></figure><p>In the announcement, OWGG organizer and&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>VFX artist Frank Le Cocq says the "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">massive layoffs</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">video game industry</a>" prompted him to "learn about how to organize to create a healthier workplace for everyone".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>union's formation was "heartening" for the then-nascent OWGG. Fellow&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>staffer and OWGG organizer Foster Elmendorf says the effort to "organize [the gaming] industry for the better" is "long overdue".</p>

<p>The new union's formation is part of a wider movement across the industry, which has seen thousands of workers unionize at their various companies. Other unions formed across the industry include folks at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" rel="nofollow">Bethesda parent ZeniMax</a>,&nbsp;<em>Evil West&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flying-wild-hog-unionizes" rel="nofollow">Flying Wild Hog</a>, and staffers at&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>dev <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-have-joined-union" rel="nofollow">Avalanche Studios</a>.</p>

<p>It's not limited to individual studios, either. Back in March, the US' first industry-wide union, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed" rel="nofollow">United Videogame Workers Union</a>, was formed, and it's open for any industry employee to join.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-zenimax.jpg?itok=34RwQPB2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overwatch-2-union-blizzard-zenimax.jpg?itok=h9omCjHF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Workers across the industry, including those at&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em>&nbsp;studio Bethesda, have been unionizing in the last few years.</figcaption></figure><p>Shockingly enough, Blizzard hasn't exactly been the most helpful company in the world when it comes to acknowledging and assisting its employees' unionization.</p>

<p>When workers at Blizzard's Albany QA division <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-albany-union-vote-approved-by-nlrb" rel="nofollow">voted to unionize</a>&nbsp;back in 2022, Activision Blizzard was accused of attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">stifle the union's formation</a>, with the company subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation" rel="nofollow">battling to delay the vote tabulation</a> for said union.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard has also been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/union-files-nlrb-complaint-against-activision-blizzard-over-labor-law" rel="nofollow">National Labor Relations Board complaint</a>&nbsp;filed on behalf of the CWA back in 2021, with the complaint alleging violations of federal labor law on the company's part.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether this new&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>union proceeds smoothly or whether Blizzard decides it wants to try and stand in the way. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Our regular PC game round-up column underwent further mysterious ructions during my absence last week, when substitute news chief Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-happening-in-pc-games-this-week-the-maw-may-6-2025">introduced a list format with subheadings</a>. I can only assume he had been driven mad by terror of being eaten by the Maw. Regardless, I will trust his instincts and follow in his footsteps. Here’s what’s coming down the pipe this week.
</p>
<h2>Monday 12th May</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437570/Chambers/">Chambers</a> is a new Weird West shooter from some of the pustulating greymass behind Golden Light, a game of peerless ugliness. I can’t wait to see what they’ve done to the six-shooters.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 13th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804010/Labyrinth_Of_The_Demon_King/">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a> is a foetid first-person dungeon-crawler set in feudal Japan. Feels like a good pick if you’ve ever wished Onimusha were more like Silent Hill</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/490110/The_Precinct/">The Precinct</a> is a top-down 1980s urban sandbox in which you are a policeman fighting gangs. Splash of GTA, obviously, but it also reminds me of grizzly 1999 crime-battler Urban Chaos.</li>
<h2>Wednesday 14th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404470/Animal_Spa/">Animal Spa</a> is a steamy resort for chibi critters that nestles at the bottom of your screen, so that you can watch them bathe while you're doing your tax returns. I don’t think this is going to boost my WPM, somehow.</li>
<h2>Thursday 15th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is "packed with gratifying and chunky violence, but restrictive combat, tedious exploration, and cinematic delusions make for a disappointing follow-up to Eternal", according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-review">review</a>. Shut up Nic, Doom Guy would never betray me</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into The Restless Ruins</a> is about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stylish-roguelite-into-the-restless-ruins-channels-classic-warhammer-quests-dungeon-crawling">building dungeons as you explore them</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503770/House_of_Legacy/">House Of Legacy</a> is a colourful isometric strategy management game, loosely inspired by imperial China.</li>
<h2>Friday 16th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246470/Kulebra_and_the_Souls_of_Limbo/">Kulebra And The Souls Of Limbo</a> is a whimsical adventure game with a touch of stealth and action, inspired by Latin American myths. Your job is to help the shades of the dearly departed find closure.
</li>
</ul><p>

As regards broader editorial happenings: I’m working on some longer-form stuff about survival games and nihilism. Nic is in hot pursuit of a review game or two. He and James are also collaborating on some kind of words-based pub brawl involving Doom: The Dark Ages. Ollie, sheriff of guidestown, has countless plans afoot. I believe some of them involve <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. Graham is busy bossing everybody around and Jeremy has eloped to a strange kingdom called "Holiday".</p>
<p>I don't know what Brendy's doing this week because he was away during the morning meeting, though he did, at least, forewarn us in a Trello note of Take Two Interactive's latest financials on the 15th, which may include updates on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> delay. Perhaps he <em>has</em> been eaten by the Maw. That’d be our 12th victim this month, if so. I’m getting pretty sick of writing letters of condolence. Anyway, what are you up to this week?

                <p>PC is typically considered the go-to platform for strategy games, but in the case of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a>, XCOM creator Julian Gollop sees great possibility for the genre to expand on the new Nintendo console, thanks to Joy-Con 2s offering mouse-like controls. While we have seen several strategy games on console make use of a custom control scheme instead of the regular mouse and keyboard experience--Frostpunk 2 and Age of Empires 2: HD being prime examples here--fans of the genre typically prefer a more traditional approach to playing these games.</p><p>"I would never have guessed that as something they would add to the console, and it's a really interesting feature," Gollop said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-creator-of-xcom-has-high-hopes-for-switch-2s-mouse-joy-cons-and-strategy-games-mouse-control-rts-might-work-really-well-here/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>. "Interestingly enough, a traditional-style mouse control RTS might work really well here, and also you've got at least a reasonable number of Switches you can use to substitute keyboard commands. It could be quite interesting. That's probably something I would look forward to. That adaptation of the traditional mouse and keyboard RTS using the Switch 2 controllers might be pretty cool."</p>

            <p>Magic: the Gathering has detailed more of its Final Fantasy card collection, and a message from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> character designer Tetsuya Nomura may hint towards the third part of the remake series.</p>
<p>The card collection includes two of Final Fantasy 7 villain Sephiroth - "Fabled SOLDIER" and "One-Winged Angel" - which form a singular piece of art when combined. The first is Sephiroth in human form, the second is his evolved form as the final boss of the game.</p>
<p>"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card," wrote Nomura in a message on social media. "I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked."</p>

<p>He then added: "There is also a reason that the design for Safer Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."</p>
<p>It's this latter comment that's got fans speculating the new artwork on the card may be taken from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part Three.</p>

<p>The biggest difference from the original game is that this Safer Sephiroth has both of his arms, where the boss form has one arm and one wing. Still, this is likely our first look at what's to come in the third remake game.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Magic: the Gathering set, each iteration of Cid from across the series will be present.</p>
<p>Cid is a recurring character who debuted in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ii">Final Fantasy 2</a> and has featured, in some form, in every game since, meaning the set will include 15 Cid, Timeless Artificer cards.</p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards will likely be widely used, as the cartridge formats available to developers and publishers are rather limited.</p>
<p>As reported by Necro Felipe on X, the recent leak from Arc System Works, which included an in-development build of Guilty Gear Stride and the reveal of a new unannounced game that will launch on the next-generation Nintendo system, confirmed that only three types of game formats are available - digital game only, 64 GB cartridge, and Game-Key Card format. As the only actual cartridge option is the 64GB one, this is likely why many of the games releasing during the system's launch window are doing so in Key Card format, and why the format will likely be widespread unless Nintendo starts offering more cartridge options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="pt">[Nintendo Switch 2]</p>
<p>Graças aos vazamentos da Arc System Works, encontrados apenas três tipos de formatos são exibidos para jogos em projeto para o Switch 2:</p>
<p>• [DL] Jogo digital apenas<br>
• [64GB] Cartucho com jogo completo<br>
• [POTION] Codinome para o formato Key Card</p>
<p>— 'Necro' Felipe #UnivNintendo (@necrolipe) <a href="https://twitter.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While new in name, the concept behind the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards is nothing new, as we have seen a lot of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S retail editions discs that don't include games, and require substantial downloads to play games, like the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. What makes this format interesting, other than the fact that they can be lent to other players as if they were a regular cartridge, is the fact that, judging from the Arc System Works leak, Game-Key cards will allow downloading of games even in regions that don't officially support the eShop.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

They story is loosely inspired by Tesfaye’s own career.</p><p>He confessed how, “Cinema has always, for me, it’s always kind of been my number one passion. I happen to sing and make music and it kind of felt like a little detour, a little cheat code to kind of get into this. I always wanted to make movies and I always wanted to make music with movies.” He added: “During that journey, you always kind of hear and see the DNA of cinema in my albums and my music videos, and my performances on my stage. It’s always just been a part of me.”</p><p>The star’s breakout acting role came in 2023 on HBO’s “The Idol,” which received mixed reviews and criticism for both the plot and his acting chops. That said, the pop mega star admitted that “The Idol” didn’t quite feel like it was his, whereas “Hurry Up Tomorrow” brought the joy back into filmmaking. “I’m like, ‘Yeah! I do want to do this…this is great,’ ” the star said with a relieved laugh.</p><p>Tesfaye’s decision to retire his stage name came during a time his voice began to fail him, describing the film as a “guiding light” to push him forward to the next step in his career. “It felt like I had nothing else to say,” the 35-year-old revealed. “I was on stage and it’s like, I’ve said everything I can say as this person. Now it’s time for me to take that next step.”</p><p>While Tesfaye’s breakout role may have left fans less than inspired, many are gearing up to see what’s next for him in this “intentionally mysterious” mind bending thriller, co-written by the music artist.</p><p>Since kicking off his career with acclaimed mixtape “House of Balloons,” Tesfaye has reportedly taken home a total of 176 awards out of 513 nominations including Grammy, Billboard, American Music, and MTV Awards. </p><p>“Hurry Up Tomorrow” is set to release in theaters May 16.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Thursday, May 8.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-5-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for The Last of Us season 2, episode 5.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie’s descent into violence truly kicks off in this week’s episode of The Last of Us. The show’s fifth chapter sees her brutally assault Nora in the spore-infested basement of the WLF’s hospital base. It’s one of the game’s most recognisable scenes and remains similarly harrowing in HBO’s adaptation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and three other key sequences from the original game were adapted for this episode. Here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seattle Day 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-guitar-1747046641492.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In both the game and the show Dina listens in on WLF radio chatter to work out the group’s location and patrol patterns. In the game, we see Dina explain all this to Ellie – in part because it helps establish the objectives of the upcoming level. In the show, Dina takes notes but there is no like-for-like conversation about what the WLF codes mean. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the theater, Ellie explores the auditorium and finds a guitar. It’s one of the more memorable scenes from the game – Ellie takes a seat in the front row and begins to play. In the show, Ellie instead sits on a stool up on the stage. Both versions play the opening of Pearl Jam’s Future Days, although Ellie in the game sings the first two lines – show Ellie sings just the first. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, Day 2 sees Ellie head out to Hillcrest. That section of the game is pretty much cut entirely from the show – there’s no hiding from dogs in overgrown houses – but we do get a version of the Seraphite mural that is seen shortly after Ellie leaves the theater. In the game, the “Feel Her Love” graffiti is on the back of a truck. In the show, a similar image is painted on a wall. The WLF have left dead Seraphites below it as some kind of ironic gesture. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Stalkers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-stalker-1747046657037.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the episode, Ellie and Dina have a tense encounter with a group of Stalkers. While Ellie does come across Stalkers on Day 2 in the game, this scene isn’t a direct translation of that moment. For one, Dina is now with Ellie – in the game, Dina stays at the cinema. The location has also changed; Ellie was attacked in an office building in the game, where the show’s Stalker showdown takes place in a warehouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More significantly, though, the show’s Stalkers behave in a very different manner to their game counterparts. In the game, Stalkers are cautious, almost skittish predators, and so this encounter is a tense game of cat-and-mouse as you try to spot where they are hiding. While the show has made suggestion that Stalkers are more intelligent than the more animalistic Runner variants, in this scene there’s little evidence of that. The Stalkers pretty much just charge – or, indeed, run – at Ellie and Dina, and attempt to break into the cage the duo have barricaded themselves inside of.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another change comes with the reintroduction of Jesse into this section of the story. In the game, towards the end of the Hillcrest section, Jesse emerges from the shadows to catch Ellie before she walks into a WLF patrol. In the show, Jesse turns up to help Ellie and Dina escape from the Stalkers. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Seraphites</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-seraphite-1747046680529.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of what players will remember of Hillcrest has been removed for the show’s version of events, memories of the game will very much be evoked by the group’s encounter with the Seraphites. The forest and foliage is very similar to Part 2’s environment, and the sequence in which a hanging man is killed by his Seraphite captors is very close to the events of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key difference here is in the people present. In the game, Ellie explores this area on her own, whereas in the show she is accompanied by Dina and Jesse. This directly impacts a key moment when a Seraphite fires a bow and arrow; in the game, the arrow strikes Ellie and she is forced to wrench it from her shoulder. In the show, it is Dina who is shot, the arrow hitting her leg. This forces the group to move on, carrying Dina to safety.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">St. Mary’s Hospital</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-ellie-1747046698648.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This episode's big, climactic event takes place in St. Mary’s Hospital. It's the sequence that most closely resembles the video game – a near 1:1 recreation of Nora's final minutes. Like the game, Ellie finds Nora in the WLF-occupied hospital and holds her at gunpoint, demanding to know where Abby is. Their exchange culminates in Nora saying that Joel got what he deserves, her wording in the show closely resembling the script of the game. She then makes a run for it, throwing a container of liquid at Ellie to momentarily stun her. That last detail is slightly different to the game, in which Nora just throws a steel tray that only catches Ellie off guard for a second. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase through the hospital is similar to that in the game, although notably shorter and less game-y. Nora shouts for her allies to shoot and they do so from a balcony, replicating the gunfire that sparks around Ellie as you push her forward in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase finally ends in the same spore-filled corridor bathed in red light that we saw in the game. Nora, collapsed and breathing in fatal spores, finally realises who Ellie is. “You’re her,” she says in both versions of the story. In the show, Ellie then takes a single swing with a metal pipe and the show cuts to black. In the game, Nora’s death is much, much more violent - with the camera lingering on Ellie’s twisted face, she strikes Nora three times. While this shot isn’t used for the show, HBO does somewhat replicate it a minute earlier by holding the camera on Ellie’s face as she holds Nora at gunpoint. It’s not as viscerally powerful as the shot from the game, but you can see where the inspiration comes from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our spoiler-free season two review and our spoiler-filled review of the fifth episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-6s-new-look-wolf-hawkfield-has-more-than-a-whiff-of-ganondorf-about-him-and-impressive-muscle-jiggle-physics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has revealed another playable character for its upcoming new Virtua Fighter game: Wolf Hawkfield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wolf is a Canadian professional wrestler of Native American descent who debuted in the original Virtua Fighter game in 1993 and has appeared as a playable character in every installment in the series since. His inclusion in the upcoming new Virtua Fighter comes as no surprise, but what has raised eyebrows is his new look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Wolf looks a lot older than his previous versions, and, as many fans have pointed out, he also looks a bit like Ganondorf, the main villain from The Legend of Zelda games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega’s announcement video shows Wolf’s walk-out scene, which fans are joking offers more story than he’s ever had before in a Virtua Fighter game before. The announcer’s intro touches on Wolf’s dramatic return to the world of fighting after his “controversial retirement that shocked the world.” Perhaps this new Virtua Fighter will offer a proper, fleshed out story mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video lacks gameplay, but it does show just how detailed the character models are even now, seemingly years away from Virtua Fighter’s release. As Wolf walks out we see quite noticeable muscle jiggle physics at play. Clearly, Wolf has kept himself in good shape over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6, as it’s being called by fans in lieu of an official title, is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-fans-hope-the-new-game-comes-close-to-matching-this-incredible-in-engine-concept-video">Sega released what it called a “pre-development concept video” for Virtua Fighter 6</a>, but made clear it does not reflect how the upcoming fighting game will look and play when it eventually comes out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, shown during Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at CES 2025, features incredibly realistic and fluid animations for a fighting game. We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Lunar Remastered Collection Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/12/lunar-remastered-collection-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lunar-remastered-collection-review.1186737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/12/lunar-remastered-collection-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The opening cutscene of Lunar Silver Star Story might be the most ‘90s introduction to any game I’ve ever played… and I was alive in the 90s. Presented here in glorious 4:3, and accompanied by Noriyuki Iwadare and Victor Ireland’s track ‘Wings’, it captures a moment in gaming and culture where anime was making inroads into the West, and Japanese developers could push the latest hardware to newfound heights, making this a golden age for JRPGs.</p>
<p>While Sony had sewn up huge franchises like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, SEGA still had plenty of clout, and the Saturn – one of my favourite consoles of all time – played host to some amazing JRPGs, with Lunar Silver Star Story sitting at the top of the pile. Admittedly, it later found its way to PlayStations around the world too, but Saturn had it first, alright?</p>
<p><iframe title="LUNAR Remastered Collection | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdhkD6g6NR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lunar Silver Star Story Remastered Collection is, in essence, a remaster of a remake, with the very first Lunar appearing for the Mega CD/Sega CD in 1992, before being remade as Lunar Silver Star Story in 1996. GungHo have pulled together Lunar Silver Star Story and its sequel, and given them a buff and a scrub suitable for modern platforms, bumping the resolution, cleaning up the cutscenes and adding in some welcome quality of life changes that make the games easier to live with nearly two decades after their original release.</p>
<p>The first game follows the adventures of Alex, a young man who dreams of becoming the next Dragonmaster, and who, after encountering the White Dragon Quark, discovers that it might just become a reality. Set on this path, he finds himself facing off against the big-bad Ghaleon, a former hero whose outlook was corrupted after the Goddess Althena decided to give up her power, and become human. As with all the best baddies, he believes that he’s right, willing to turn the world upside down to prove a point.</p>

<p>Alex is initially accompanied on this quest by his cute cat/bird companion Nall, Ramus, a dumpy treasure-obsessed friend, and his lifelong companion, Luna, and you’ll meet various other characters and party members along the way who all cement the fact that Lunar Silver Stary Story is a genuine classic. That’s helped by energetic and committed performances from the entire cast, with the characters truly coming to life across the many hours you’ll spend with them.</p>

<p>Lunar 2: Eternal Blue sees you take on the role of Hiro, an adventurer who finds himself caught up with the mysterious Lucia, aiding her in her quest to meet the returning Goddess Althena. Both stories feel enjoyably old-school – timeless tales that still hold up in the modern age.</p>
<p>Whichever of the games you’re playing, the artwork helps to paint an even clearer picture, and Toshiyuki Kubooka’s character design absolutely shines here thanks to the enhanced resolution and widescreen aspect. I love this classic mid-90s look, and it’s reminiscent of artwork in other games and anime of the era like Guardian Heroes and Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
<p>Both games effectively mix animated cutscenes, pre-rendered backgrounds and pixel-art, and it’s just such an alluring combination. It’s not as spectacular perhaps as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest HD-2D</a>, or modern takes on the genre like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveller</a>, but it’s great looking, and the visuals help carry the story along perfectly.</p>

<p>The main action is resolutely turn-based, but there are a few surprises to the way that combat plays out, not least the necessity to choose how your team is positioned, and which enemies they can attack based upon that. It adds a spot more thought to each action, and some surprises along the way when things don’t quite play out as you were expecting. There’s also an auto-battle mode, which would have been trendsetting at the time, and is still a real boon when you’re making your way through dungeons and facing off against low-level mobs.</p>
<p>The key new addition is the ability to alter the battle speed, and alongside the auto-battler function it makes grinding and exploring feel so much less of a chore than it can do in these old-school RPGs. I wish that all RPGs were so considerate of your time!</p>
<p>If you’re a purist who’s looking to play both of the games as they were originally intended, it’s great to find that both the original and the remastered versions have been included here. However, with the reduced resolution and bars either side of the screen, it feels like there’s little to no reason to do this, other than pure curiosity. It would have been nice to be able to switch between the two versions mid-game, but you have to start them separately from the main menu.</p>

<p>There are a few old-school foibles to deal with – whether its tricky route-finding through dungeons, having to work your way back through the same areas, or the constant ‘La La La Laaaaaaa’ of Luna’s magical healing song in the first game, but they’re minor annoyances that you can forgive given the age of the originals.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> REVO, the latest edition of Sega's nearly 19-year-old fighting sequel, is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtua-fighter-is-making-its-3d-pc-debut-this-winter-including-rollback-netcode">PC debut earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
For those who haven't been following Virtua Fighter 5's convoluted journey over the last two decades, REVO is a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a>, which initially launched for PS4 in 2021. That, in turn, was a remaster of the game's supposedly final revision, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown, which arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2012.
</p>
<p>
As to how Virtua Fighter 5 REVO differentiates itself from the series' most recent revision, the PC version introduced 4K graphics, high-res textures, rollback netcode support to optimise online play, and new online modes enabling competition with up to 16 other players.

<p>
Presumably, Sega's newly announced console editions will be similarly enhanced, but the publisher is yet to provide specific details beyond the fact cross-play will be supported, and there's no word of a release window either. "We're going to include even more content to make this much more than a simple port," it adds, "which we'll tell you about in future updates."
</p>
<p>
News of Virtua Fighter 5 REVO's console release comes after last year's confirmation a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">brand-new entry in the much-loved fighting series is on the way</a>. That reveal was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-in-engine-look-at-next-virtua-fighter-game-revealed">first in-engine footage</a> back in January, and Sega has now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnyE4tsQ3w8">similarly styled teaser</a> showcasing returning character Wolf Hawkfield. Sega's new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> project is part of the initiative announced in 2023, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">see it revisiting a number of its previously dormant classic properties</a>, including  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and Shinobi.

            <p>The star of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s next game has said she's received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from studio boss Neil Druckmann, following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2.</p>
<p>Actress Tati Gabrielle will star as bounty hunter Jordan A Mun in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Naughty Dog's upcoming sci-fi project for PlayStation 5. While Gabrielle has worked close to video games before - on PlayStation's Uncharted film adaptation and as Nora in The Last of Us' TV series - this will be her first video game role.</p>
<p>In preparation, Gabrielle said she had been given mental "bootcamp-ing" by Druckmann, as she becomes the face of the game.</p>

<p>"Neil's been bootcamp-ing me. I know Troy [Baker]'s experience, I know Ashley [Johnson]'s experience..." Gabrielle told <a href="https://ew.com/tati-gabrielle-of-the-last-of-us-about-to-go-intergalactic-exclusive-11732492">EW</a>.</p>
<p>"I know Laura Bailey's experience," Gabrielle continued, referring to the backlash Bailey received for her turn as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby.</p>
<p>Prior to The Last of Us Part 2's release, Abby's role as the character that kills Joel was leaked, sparking a wave of online abuse and death threats aimed at Bailey and her son. "Every time I went online, that's all I saw," Bailey revealed previously as part of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">behind-the-scenes documentary, Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, which was released in February last year. "Death threats and threats of violence."</p>
<p>Gabrielle revealed that, like Bailey, she too has been the subject of backlash since it was announced she would star in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Already, she has had misogynistic and racist comments sent her way.</p>
<p>"I got a lot of love, but there was a lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of colour, me having my head shaved, all these things that I didn't even actually initially see," Gabrielle said. "I'm out of the social media zeitgeist for that reason - but once I did, Neil [Druckmann] was like, 'Ignore it. No matter what, me and you, we're going to make something beautiful. We're going to make something that we're proud of'."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The actress also spoke more about the upcoming game's theme of faith. Back in March of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann explained how Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet features a fictitious religion</a> which "becomes pretty prominent" in the game's alternate history.</p>
<p>"The question of faith is not black and white," Gabrielle elaborated. "When you initially think of faith, you think of religion, which is a part of it, but there's also faith in oneself. There's faith in your environment or your community. All that faith means is, What are your beliefs?</p>
<p>"What are the things that you hope for? Faith sounds flowery, but we all experience it day in and day out. What is your reason for waking up?"</p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5. Last year, Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, including "multiple single-player projects", this being one of them.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in studio news, Naughty Dog and HBO have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-something-in-the-air-as-ellie-sees-red-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-five">just aired the fifth episode of The Last of Us season two</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The creator of the amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project</a>, which was so good even in its first few versions that it was officially implemented in the next-gen version, released some stunning texture packs for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>The first of these packs created by Halk Hogan PL is the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1614?tab=images" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ultra Quality 8K Body Textures - Imperials</a> pack, which comes in different resolution options, including 8K diffuse with the best quality, improves body details and quality, makes skin color more natural, and is more suitable for all Imperial characters. The results are excellent, as highlighted in the comparison screenshots on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1614?tab=images">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the description of the texture pack above found on Nexus Mods, the Ultra Quality 8K Body Textures pack is best used with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1284">Realistic High Quality Skin pack</a>, which improves human skin and makes it more realistic for all the races found in Oblivion Remastered, except for Argonians and Khajiits. This texture pack also slightly improves face details.</p>
<p>The third Oblivion Remastered texture pack shared by Halk Hogan PL is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2522?tab=description">Smooth Beautiful Faces pack</a>, which introduces impressive face textures that are a significant improvement over the vanilla textures. Among the improvements the new textures bring are more detailed lips, high-quality eyebrows, and more. Despite the new textures working best for female characters with the youngest possible age of the character creator, they still improve the faces of characters of all ages.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-underground-remaster-hopes-increase-as-iconic-skater-says-hell-campaign-all-i-can<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the skating icon has said he has "aspirations" for further remakes, including one for the popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-underground">Tony Hawk's Underground</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">Screen Rant</a>, Hawk said the decision to continue remaking older games ultimately rested with the company he worked with - that'd be publisher Activision, and ultimately its owner Microsoft - but that he would "campaign all I can".
</p>
<p>
Still, Hawk's wishes appear to hold at least some sway - such as with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bam-margera-officially-returning-to-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">seemingly last-minute restoration of skater Bam Margera to the roster of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I always have aspirations," Hawk said on the possibility of Underground being remastered next. "It's not up to me generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me."
</p>
<p>
Asked if a decision on Underground was too early, before the launch of Pro Skater 3+4, Hawk added: "Yeah, we haven't even released this game."
</p>
<p>
Activision had looked ready not to continue the Tony Hawk's series at all, despite a positive reception to Pro Skater 1+2 when it arrived back in 2020. Its developer, Vicarious Visions, was later shuffled over to become part of Blizzard, and the future of Hawk's skating series put on ice. 
</p>
<p>
But teases from Hawk himself last year of talks between himself and Activision ultimately resulted in a reversal of fortunes. Earlier this year, Activision began teasing a Pro Skater 3+4 remake within Call of Duty, before making the project official on 4th March.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will launch on 11th July for Nintendo Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S including through Game Pass Ultimate.

This is the same editor the developers use internally for all gameplay development. This first release lets modders work with everything from level scenarios to game modes, tinker with AI behavior, abilities and melee combo logic, user interface and HUD elements, and make much of the general modding work with Space Marine 2 faster and easier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not long ago, I promised we would support the modding scene — and we meant it,” Grigorenko said. “Watching this community grow, push boundaries, and create incredible experiences has been both inspiring and humbling. We’re excited to see what you build next — whether it’s a cinematic campaign, wild new game mode, or something we never saw coming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the ball rolling, Grigorenko released jokey concept art for a "Fishing With Daddy Calgar" mini-game, below, which is technically possible now with these tools. Calgar is Marneus Calgar, the leader of the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/11/fishing-1746999241862.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The race is on to create Space Marine 2's first fishing mini-game mod.

Meanwhile, the Space Marine 2 modding community is racing to actually make the Fishing With Daddy Calgar mini-game mod Grigorenko challenged them to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Space Marine 2 fans is hugely positive, and with good reason. While Space Marine 2 is well-received and has gone down as one of the best-selling Warhammer video games of all time, it is relatively limited in terms of its official offering. That is to say, it contains three factions only: Space Marines, Chaos (a mix of Chaos Marines and some Tzeentch Daemons), and the Tyrannids. Players had hoped for DLC that might extend the faction roster (the Space Marine 2 campaign teased the Necrons), but can now take matters into their own hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is how you keep a game alive for years like Skyrim,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1kjgnix/comment/mrn2sq9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Mortwight</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a particularly interesting development in the context of Saber and publisher Focus Entertainment’s announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 is in development</a>.
