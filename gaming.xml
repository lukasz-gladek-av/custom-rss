			<p>Just a few days ago,<a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3314a19koo147/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-pc-october-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rockstar announced</a> that the Red Dead Redemption Remaster will be arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/">PC as of October 29</a>. In this announcement, the system requirements were mentioned, but the price of the game was not revealed. The game is set to be released on the Epic Games Store, Steam, and the RockStar Store, depending on what launcher you want to use. Today, the Epic Games Store seems to have leaked the price of the game, with it set to cost $49.99. This was shown in a <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/red-dead-redemption-remaster-will-be-priced-at-4999-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshot by John Papadopoulos over at DSOGaming</a>.&nbsp; At the moment, the game is starkly cheaper on console, with Red Dead Redemption costing $29.99 on every other platform, not including when the game goes on sale. However, it's possible that the game is set to cost more on PC, as Red Dead Redemption is set to have PC-specific enhancements, such as native 4K resolution up to 144hz on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>The list of PC-specific features doesn't end there, though. This remaster being ported to PC was done in collaboration with Double Eleven to add monitor support for Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide monitors, as well as full keyboard and mouse functionality for those who prefer a more tactile experience rather than using a controller.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game will have NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling, as well as NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and many graphic settings that can be tweaked, such as draw distances and shadow quality settings. Luckily, the system requirements are pretty reasonable, and most people will be able to play it on their PC, as the game requires a RTX 2070 as a recommendation, with the game being playable on even older graphics cards.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not known whether the game will be compatible on Steam Deck, as Red Dead Redemption 2 is just about playable on a Steam Deck. Despite that, Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the top games played on a Steam Deck.&nbsp; Recently, Grand Theft Auto V became unsupported on a Steam Deck after being one of the top games played on the handheld console. However, due to Rockstar Games adding anti-cheat features to the game, people will only be able to play the story mode of the game on the Steam Deck, with no access to the online servers whatsoever. Compared to the second game, Red Dead Redemption is more story-focused, but the game will be released with the zombie-horror story, Undead Nightmare, allowing players to team up and fight back against the zombie horde.</p>

It’s a tribute so accurate that seemingly every player has been quickly stumped by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987">Great Ape Vegeta</a></span>, the most threatening villain during the series’ Saiyan Saga. It’s quite a wake-up call when the first boss-like fight in the game has you questioning how difficult things are going to get. But it <em>can be done</em>.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987"><em>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</em>’s Great Ape Vegeta Fight Is Kicking Everyone’s Ass</a></span></p><p>He’s a monstrous ape with spammy attacks that will shred your health. Making it more challenging, you’ll be playing as one of the weakest versions of Goku. Even if you lower the difficulty, you might keep struggling. The good news is that he <em>can</em> be beaten, and just like the show, you just need some more training.</p><h2 id="h6589"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #1Prepare with Battle Training</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-recommend-id="image://1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan training with Piccolo for Rush High-Speed Movement." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan training with Piccolo for Rush High-Speed Movement." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-recommend-id="image://1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan training with Piccolo for Rush High-Speed Movement." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I completely understand the desire to just mash through stuff. A lot of the fun in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is hitting some buttons and seeing your character do some flashy hype stuff. You might think that’s enough after the quick tutorial and the first four fights in Goku’s Episode Battle story. As it turns out, this game has quite a lot of mechanics and techniques under the hood, and you’re going to want to get involved.<br></p><p><strong>If you’re having issues with this cocky ape, I highly recommend that you go through Battle Training, which is listed under the Super Training menu.</strong> This breaks down every mechanic in the game against Piccolo. I’ll be the first to admit that it’s not the most well-made training mode, and getting through it isn’t particularly enjoyable. However, <strong>you’ll be missing out on a large chunk of gameplay mechanics when you’re only going off of the tutorial</strong>. Knowing these will help you against Great Ape Vegeta and later fights as well.</p><p>High-movement mechanics will be the main focus of this fight. Avoiding his attacks and getting behind him will help a ton. These are the mechanics to nail down along with their respective inputs for PlayStation and Xbox:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon Dash</strong> - The flying dash you should be aware of from the tutorial. What’s important to recognize is how much Ki it drains while in use. Performed with R2 + Cross or RT + A. Automatically rushes forward, but moving the left stick will dictate its direction.</li><li><strong>Z-Burst Dash</strong> - This is an extension of Dragon Dash that rushes you directly behind the opponent. It uses one bar of Ki and is an important move for this boss. Performed with the same inputs, R2 + Cross or RT + A. The left stick needs to be left in a neutral position.</li><li><strong>Vanishing Assault (Close-Range)</strong> - Teleports you directly behind your opponent. It uses one bar of Ki and requires you to be in close range. Performed with Square + Cross or X + A.</li><li><strong>Rush High-Speed Movement</strong> - This is an extension from Rush Attacks, allowing you to teleport around the enemy mid-way through your Rush combo. Uses a half-bar of Ki and is dependent on what direction the left stick is pushing towards. Press up will teleport you behind them, pressing left will teleport you to their left side, etc. Performed with the left stick pushed in a direction + R1 or RB.</li><li><strong>High-Speed Evasion</strong> - A counter-like evasion that teleports you directly behind the opponent when they’re attacking. The timing is strict, but it’s a great option that doesn’t use Ki. Performed with R1 or RB right before an attack hits.</li></ul><p>As tempting as it is, using an actual counter can provide mixed results in this fight. The size of this monster makes it hard to knock him off balance in one hit. Most counters will boop him away a bit, without giving you much advantage. Prioritizing hits and dodges will be more effective.</p><h2 id="h6590"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #2How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-recommend-id="image://f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-recommend-id="image://f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It already seemed like <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> deserved some recognition based on people’s feelings in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746">previews and reviews</a></span>. I believe it also deserves recognition for how often it can catch you off guard. Quite a few of the Episode Battles involve fights where the opponent immediately goes on the offensive. Great Ape Vegeta here is one of the more frustrating examples, as he’ll use his Super Attacks as soon as possible. Sometimes that’s right as the match starts, and sometimes he’ll give you a second or two of leeway.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> Previews Suggest That We Are So Back, Y’all</a></span></p><p><strong>You want to respond to the startup of his Super with a Z-Burst Dash.</strong> Using a Dragon Dash to the side and then following up with a Z-Burst Dash will typically get you in the clear. Alternatively, you can leave the stick alone and double-tap the Dragon Dash buttons to instantly get the Z-Burst Dash out. This works well when he starts the match with a super, but sometimes can rush you in front of him due to how he moves. This is the best you can do against an honestly pretty busted start from this jackass space ape.</p><p>Either way, the goal is to get close to him (preferably from behind) and start pummeling him with Rush attacks. You’re free to mash those Rush attacks when hitting him from behind. He can be slow to move around and only has one counter move to brush you away.</p><p><strong>If you’re attacking him in the front, I suggest going with a four-hit combo and then stepping or dashing to the side before trying again.</strong> His throw has great vertical range and can’t be countered, but it’s slow enough that a dash to the side will leave him open. I feel more comfortable using Rush High-Speed Movement because the attacks will build up the spent Ki pretty quickly. Use a Vanishing Assault instead if you’re not confident enough with those close-range side dashes. He’ll enter a hit stun state after enough hits and allow you to launch him.</p><p>Once you’ve slapped him around a couple of times and sent him flying to the ground below, it’s time to start charging your Ki. There’s a solid chance he’ll do the same until he has enough to use his supers. From this point, you have two options: keep whittling him down with close-range attacks, or try to bait out a particular super attack for big damage. Let’s go over the former first.</p><p>Using a Z-Burst dash to rush back to him is arguably the safer place to be. It’s relatively easy to dodge his supers at this range and respond with more Rush attacks or even a Kamehameha to chip more of his health away. You can also use a Kaioken skill once you have enough skill points built up. The Solar Flare skill never worked on him in my experience, while the Kaioken’s buffs were always appreciated. Keep up this routine of weaving past his attacks, hitting him until you get a launch combo, and then charging Ki before you dash in again. It will take a while, but he’ll fall sooner than later.</p><h2 id="h6591"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #3How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta Quickly</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-recommend-id="image://a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-recommend-id="image://a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t like keeping distance in this fight, because Great Ape Vegeta has a deceptively quick dash that he can use to combo into his supers. Be ready to block or counter if the big guy suddenly zooms into your face. That being said, you can take his health bar down quite a bit if he attacks from afar. <strong>This other strategy is to bait out his Chou Makouhou Super and respond with your Kamehameha Super for a beam clash.</strong> You’ll know it’s the right one when he says “I’ll break you!” before firing a mouth beam.<br></p><p>A cinematic of two beams heading into each other will start to play. Then you just need to beat the minigame to win the struggle. The AI is pretty lenient here, so you should be able to do this with no problem. Winning the beam clash will take off two entire bars of his health. This is one of the most damaging things you can do, but it’s risky and left up to chance. There’s no telling which super he’ll use, or whether he’ll decide to close the gap quickly with a dash. If it works out, you’ll be a lot closer to finishing this fight.</p><p>Remember to charge up your Ki again after the beam clash concludes. You can then decide to try to bait him again with a beam clash or to mix it up with some close-range attacks. I prefer to not tempt fate twice, but he’ll be nearly finished if you can win two beam clashes.</p><hr><p>Great Ape Vegeta isn’t the toughest boss in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, but he is a major knowledge check for the game’s mechanics. Brush up on that knowledge and you’ll be fine. I don’t believe it’s outwardly said, but you shouldn’t think you can skirt around with Ability Item buffs either. Those won’t work in Episode Battles. You’ll need to solely rely on what you learn from training, which to be fair, is the Goku way.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That puts Yajirobe in the same lane as Saibaman, Frieza Soldiers, and Guldo. However, the “bean daddy” is punching way above his weight. </p><p>“Bean daddy,” which I’m going to write as many times as my editor will allow, refers to Yajirobe’s penchant for always saving the day with Korin’s magical Senzu beans. In <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, the series’ number one medic can heal himself repeatedly in matches using a renewable Senzu bean skill for three skill stocks. Combined with his ultimate, it can make him surprisingly effective despite being a back-bencher. </p><p>But the “bean daddy” is even more deadly due to the match timer. Whoever has the most health at the end of the time limit automatically wins. This means that Yajirobe players can simply land some hits and then keep running away and chowing down in order to eke out wins. It’s a cheap strategy that is also completely in keeping with the spirit of the character. And plenty of people are pissed about it. </p><p>The <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> subreddit, Discord, YouTube, and Tiktok are full of players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g00fat/criticism_for_ranked_so_far_from_top_ranked/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g00fat/criticism_for_ranked_so_far_from_top_ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confessing to getting wrecked in online matches</a></span> by aspiring “bean daddies.” “Those that play bean daddy and spam senzus have super size dragon balls if you think I’m not gonna find you after that match...” lamented one player on the game’s unofficial Discord. “My only loss was to a Yajirobe dude who had like 5 low dp characters,” wrote another. “He spammed senzu bean and RAN AWAY until time ran out.”</p><p>And the “bean daddy” takeover <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/439864-dragon-ball-sparking-zero/80862609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/439864-dragon-ball-sparking-zero/80862609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">may just be beginning</a></span>. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCXCrqI4xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCXCrqI4xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yajirobe is totally cracked</a></span>,” according to one YouTuber. A second reads, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp5A9slBRJU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp5A9slBRJU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RANKED YAJIROBE WAS A MISTAKE</a></span>!” People are already getting jaded. “Yajirobe needs a nerf, no I’m not kidding,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1g06xf3/yajirobe_needs_a_nerf_no_im_not_kidding/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1g06xf3/yajirobe_needs_a_nerf_no_im_not_kidding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads a Reddit thread</a></span>. “’Just don’t let him use it.’ All it takes is like 2 seconds for him to activate it. He just has to wait it out and knock you away once and boom he’s back to full health again.”</p><p>But calls for “Bean Daddy” nerfs are already getting some pushback. Unlike a lot of fighting games, the <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi </em>series upon which <em>Sparking Zero </em>is based was never aimed at pursuing perfect competitive fairness. They were supposed to be a celebration of the anime and the manga that it’s based on, inclusive of all its goofy absurdities and nonsensical plot developments. Some characters have more health and more powerful attacks in <em>Sparking Zero</em>, and to compensate, they take up more points on online rosters. </p><p>The new game focuses on online play and ranked leaderboards (sadly, local matches are limited to a single map), so there will be more pressure to balance characters than in the past. Even so, some want to preserve the series’ unhinged ethos. “Unpopular opinion, I want no character nerfed in<em> Sparking Zero</em>,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Rhymestyle/status/1844157348258181291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Rhymestyle/status/1844157348258181291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Twitch streamer rhymstyle. “Let the chaos be as it is designed to be.  this is the<em> Tenkaichi</em> law since 2007.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Throughout the game industry's short history, there's been ample debate about how much piracy actually impacts a game's legitimate sales. On one side, some publishers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/09/software-piracy-and-job-growth-a-zero-sum-game/">try to argue</a> that every single pirated download should count as a "lost sale" that they would have logged in a theoretical piracy-free world. On the other side, some wiseacres argue that most pirates would never consider paying for a legitimate version of the game in the first place or that piracy can actually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/">be useful</a> as a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/how-one-game-developer-is-making-the-pirate-bay-work-for-him/">word-of-mouth promotional tool</a>.</p>
<p>While the true effect of piracy on sales revenue is likely somewhere between those two extremes, piracy's precise financial impact on a game has always been hard to nail down. Now, though, a recently published study uses <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/denuvos-drm-ins-now-being-cracked-within-hours-of-release/">post-release cracks</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/denuvo-wants-to-convince-you-its-drm-isnt-evil/">Denuvo's DRM protections</a> as a sort of natural experiment on games sales in pre- and post-piracy worlds. The results "imply an average proportionate loss of revenue of around 19 percent in each week of release if a crack is available," according to the study, suggesting that effective DRM can actually have a significant impact on a publisher's bottom line.</p>
<h2>The data dance</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952124002532?dgcid=author#fn9">"The Revenue Effects of Denuvo Digital Rights Management on PC Video Games,"</a>&nbsp;published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/entertainment-computing">Entertainment Computing</a>, UNC research associate <a href="https://uncipc.org/index.php/people/william-volckmann/">William Volckmann</a> examines 86 different Denuvo-protected games initially released on Steam between September 2014 and the end of 2022. That sample includes many games where Denuvo protection endured for at least 12 weeks (when new sales tend to drop off to "negligible" amounts for most games) and many others where earlier cracks allowed for widespread piracy at some point.</p>

<p>Crucially, the presence and/or specific timing of a crack's availability couldn't be effectively predicted by characteristics like pricing or critical review scores. That makes the existence of a crack "a practically exogenous event" that can be used to effectively segregate a game's revenues in a no-piracy world (i.e., before the Denuvo crack is available) and a piracy-filled world (i.e., after the crack's release). The variable timing of different crack releases also helps the relative analysis, since "revenue is highest close to the release date, and therefore a crack that appears close to the release date has a disproportionately large effect on revenue," Volckmann writes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/steam-gauge/">lack of good publicly available sales data</a> for most games makes it difficult to measure these revenue effects directly. To estimate a Steam game's relative sales decline in each week after release, Volckmann uses a proxy that combines the number of new Steam user reviews and, for single-player narrative games, the game's average active player count. While Volckmann acknowledges that these imperfect estimates represent "the biggest limitation of this study," any estimated biases away from actual sales data seem likely to cancel out across the various games in the sample.</p>

<h2>“The no-crack counterfactual”</h2>
<p>After applying some complex statistical models to the underlying data, Volckmann finds that, unsurprisingly, relative revenues in the weeks following a crack's release are lower than the baseline expectation for uncracked games in the same time period. These negative effects of a crack on revenues—which are highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.01)—"impl[ies] that the appearance of a crack reduces revenue relative to the no-crack counterfactual," Volckmann writes.</p>

<p>Just how much money a publisher can expect to lose from a Denuvo crack, though, depends heavily on how quickly the game is cracked, Volckmann finds. A Denuvo-protected game cracked in the first week after release can expect to make about 20 percent less revenue than if the DRM had remained in place, according to the study, while a crack six weeks after a game's release only costs an estimated 5 percent of theoretical total revenue. After 12 weeks, new sales are so negligible that "developers could eventually remove unpopular DRM schemes with minimal losses (and possible gains from strongly DRM-averse consumers)," Volckmann suggests (and some publishers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/after-cracks-developers-remove-denuvo-drm-from-their-games/">have done just that</a> after Denuvo is no longer effectively protecting new sales).</p>
<p>Volckmann's data lines up with public statements that Denuvo-maker Irdeto has made regarding the need for DRM to protect a game's crucial post-launch window. "We don't position Denuvo Anti Tamper as being uncrackable—no anti piracy solution is," Denuvo VP of Sales Robert Hernandez <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/denuvo-our-cracked-re7-protection-is-still-better-than-nothing/">told Ars in 2017</a>. "However, our goal is to keep each title safe from piracy during the crucial initial sales window when most of the sales are made."</p>

<p>Overall, according to Volckmann's data, Denuvo is doing just that. The median Denuvo-protected games lose almost no sales to piracy, Volckmann suggests, because the protection "more often than not" goes uncracked in that initial 12-week window. In a world with no DRM, on the other hand, Volckmann projects those games could expect 20 percent less revenue at the median.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of DRM schemes like Denuvo, the potential to protect against that kind of revenue hit is something that major publishers might find hard to ignore. And there are signs that Denuvo's protection is becoming more crack-resistant in recent months; the CrackWatch subreddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/p9ak4n/crack_watch_games/">lists 28 Denuvo-protected games released so far in 2024</a>, 26 of which remain uncracked and two of which were cracked well outside the 12-week release window. As we see in this study, that kind of robust protection can be worth a significant amount to a piracy-wary game publisher.</p>

(The "right" side presumably being whichever one doesn't have a green shell lurking nearby for users to slip on.) Alarmo also features motion-sensing technology that allows users to silence its sounds with a single handwave.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66379/p/1094/c/898" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo's official website</a>, the Alarmo v.2.0.0 update features the following tweaks, additions, and changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Added “Moderate Mode” as a new Mode option.</li><li dir="ltr">Added “Movement Record” as a new Records feature.  <ul><li dir="ltr">This will automatically display in Records if you go to bed during “Bedtime.”</li><li dir="ltr">You can set this to On or Off in the “Records” menu on the device.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">“Distance from bed” can now be set to 20in/50cm max for Queen and King size beds.</li><li dir="ltr">When “Check Sensor Zone” is run, an estimated “position of movement” will now be displayed.</li><li dir="ltr">General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In addition to the inclusion of nostalgic Nintendo sounds and a motion-sensor, Alarmo also features scenes from various Nintendo Switch titles that can be used as a background in place of the standard clock face. The following games are included in Alarmo's collection of backgrounds:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pikmin-4/">Pikmin 4</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-fit-adventure/">Ring Fit Adventure</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splatoon-3/">Splatoon 3</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-odyssey/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Users who connect Alarmo to their Nintendo Online account will gain access to two more unique clock face background scenes: one from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and one from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. But despite so many Switch games being featured in the clock's design, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66618/kw/alarmo" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo has confirmed that the Alarmo is a "standalone device"</a> that does not interact with other Nintendo hardware, including the Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Alarmo clock is available for preorder now via <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's official online store</a>, and retails for $100 USD.

<p>Red Dead Redemption for PC includes the base game and the Undead Nightmare expansion, which challenges players to fight against zombies in the wild West. The package also comes with bonus content from Red Dead Redemption's Game of the Year Edition.</p><p>Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption tells the story of the cowboy John Marston as he sets out to seek revenge in 1911.

A sequel, Red Dead Redemption II, came out in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One, followed by a PC launch in 2019.</p><p>The PC edition of Red Dead Redemption is developed by port studio Double Eleven in collaboration with Rockstar.

The game also includes support for HDR10 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling. Nvidia DLSS frame generation is also supported, while players can adjust draw distances and shadow quality settings, among other things.</p><p>The minimum and recommended PC system requirements for Red Dead Redemption were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Steam.</a> These may be subject to change.</p><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-4670 / AMD FX-9590</li><li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 / AMD Radeon R7 360</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Storage: 12 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: Direct X Compatible</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500X</li><li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 2070 / AMD RX 5700 XT</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Storage: 12 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: Direct X Compatible</li><li>Additional Notes: SSD recommended</li></ul><p>As for Rockstar Games, the studio is now developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is set for release in Fall 2025.</p>

If there’s a game you’ve been looking for, chances are that it’s currently on sale on one of the various console or PC storefronts right now. Such is the case with PlayStation, which just kicked off its massive seasonal sale that features thousands of discounted games, DLCs, in-game currencies, and more. Luckily, y’all have got me to help you sift through all those available deals for the best ones, and here’s what I’ve managed to wrangle up.<br></p></div><div><p>2024 marked the long-awaited return of<em> EA Sports College Football</em> series, which took an 11-year hiatus after legal troubles surrounding the NCAA’s willingness to pay college players for their likenesses. <em>College Football 25</em>, which launched earlier this year, was heavily anticipated as a result of that, and boy did it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253">sell like hot cakes</a></span>. I’ve never seen a football video game drive people nuts the way that this one did when it came out, and honestly, I’m really happy for the folks who’ve been clamoring for another one of these titles for so long.</p><p>Football fans in general are thriving since both <em>College Football 25 </em>and <em>Madden NFL 25 </em>released right around the same time, and EA went right ahead and even bundled the deluxe edition of both games together. <strong>The bundle with both games typically goes for $150, but it’s actually pretty significantly discounted to $112.49 at the moment.</strong> Still a hefty asking price, but considering the fact that sports game enjoyers typically pick up one or two games a year, you can’t beat that price for two of the biggest games in the genre.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259"><em>PowerWash Simulator </em>is my happy place</a></span>. I cannot stress enough how relaxing it is to turn to it when I need a low-stakes game to drop several hours into while I’m listening to a podcast, watching a show in the background, or even just casually chatting with some friends. Cycling through different nozzles to best clean a filthy bathroom or a theme park attraction is so soothing and comforting, and I’ve been relying on <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>again more recently to relax me in times of great stress. Ever since it was released, its developers have also supported it with various DLCs, including a slew of crossovers with series like <em>Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy</em>, and most recently, <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em>, as well as <em>Shrek</em>. It’s a good time, and you can even bring some friends along to help on the really deep cleans if you so desire. <strong>The point is, for $17.49, you can grab </strong><em><strong>PowerWash Simulator </strong></em><strong>and clean to your heart’s content.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’ve yet to finish <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pacific-drive-steam-ps5-survival-crafting-sim-1851282916&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pacific-drive-steam-ps5-survival-crafting-sim-1851282916"><em>Pacific Drive</em></a></span>, but it’s still one of the most special games of 2024, and I desperately need to get back around to it. A survival game set in the Pacific Northwest, <em>Pacific Drive </em>centers around a station wagon that’s been retrofitted with the necessary technology and tools to weather the supernatural phenomena of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, which you are attempting to get to the center of. As you plot a course through the Exclusion Zone, you’ll make pit stops to scrounge for materials to survive and upgrade the car, which is the real star of the show.</p><p>Not only is the car fully customizable, but it’s simply <em>everything</em>. It is the quickest way to get around the map, it’s the safest spot to be when weird shit starts happening, and it is where you will store 90 percent of the materials you find. Its maintenance is one of the most tactile experiences I’ve had in a game, and the way that the game encourages players to be hands-on with the car immediately fosters a strong connection as you embark on the world’s strangest and most dangerous road trip. <em><strong>Pacific Drive </strong></em><strong>is an offbeat good time, and you can pick it up for $18 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><em>Mass Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of gaming’s most legendary series by this point. Most people have probably heard of Bioware’s epic sci-fi RPG series, but I’m sure many haven’t actually played them since they’re a huge investment. It’s a pretty big undertaking, all things told, but that shouldn’t stop any of you from picking up this collection of remasters for the primary trilogy of the franchise. You’ll <em>eventually</em> play them, and you’ll thank me for this recommendation when you do. <em>Mass Effect</em>’s a pretty solid series of third-person shooters, but you’ll likely find that you’re more drawn to its magnetic and charming cast of characters, who you’ll befriend and even fall in love with as you fight to save the galaxy from forces beyond your wildest dreams. <strong>These titles are a saga quite unlike anything else in gaming’s history, and you </strong><em><strong>should</strong></em><strong> grab </strong><em><strong>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</strong></em><strong> while it’s only $9.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>There are, at this point, several ways to get into the <em>Like A Dragon</em>/<em>Yakuza </em>series.

A few years ago though, the series phased out its longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu for a fresh face and entirely different gameplay system, and the game that came from it has now served as a new entry point into the series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473"><em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em></a></span><em> </em>follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-s-latest-protagonist-is-the-hero-i-need-right-no-1845755843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-s-latest-protagonist-is-the-hero-i-need-right-no-1845755843">Ichiban Kasuga, Japan’s foremost himbo</a></span>, who sees the world through the lens of his favorite video game, the original <em>Dragon Quest</em>. That means that instead of brawling with dudes on the street in gruesome melee combat, he instead sees himself as the hero of a party of characters with jobs and classes who fight in turn-based combat.</p><p>Kasuga is such an effortlessly charming lead, and carries the game with aplomb, but he is aided by an equally lovable cast of allies, including a homeless doctor named Nanba, an ex-cop named Adachi, and a hostess manager named Saeko, among so many other wonderful faces. Most importantly, you don’t really need to understand much of the previous games to know about any of them or their motivations, which are all spelled out over the course of the lengthy RPG. There are characters from the larger series whose actions echo throughout the game, but this installment <em>mostly </em>kicks off its own story while carrying forward the tenets of <em>Like A Dragon </em>that have made the series such a smashing success over the last decade. <em><strong>Yakuza: Like A Dragon </strong></em><strong>is a wonderful starting point for anyone curious about the franchise, and it’s only $10 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>To make a long story remarkably short<em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/titanfall-2-the-kotaku-review-1788374693&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/titanfall-2-the-kotaku-review-1788374693"><em>Titanfall 2</em></a></span><em> </em>is simply one of the most essential shooters of the last decade. The way that people speak about <em>Half-Life </em>and its sequel is the way that we should and will talk about <em>Titanfall 2 </em>in the years to come, and it’s already begun. The criminally overlooked shooter sees Respawn Entertainment firing on all cylinders in ways I didn’t even think possible. Its campaign is bursting at the seams with an energy I haven’t found in many other first-person shooters, and nearly every one of its missions defies the bog-standard conventions of the genre. It’s a live wire of a game, and you owe it to yourself to play what should be one of the most influential FPS games of our time. <strong>Luckily, </strong><em><strong>Titanfall 2 </strong></em><strong>is regularly on sale, and when it is it’s always dirt cheap, so consider this your reminder to pick up one of the best shooters ever while it’s $5 right now.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span><em> </em>is another one of the all-timers of the last several years. It’s creepy as hell, but also deeply silly, which is a tightrope act that the developer Remedy Entertainment has been honing for quite some time now.

I love <em>Control</em>’s constantly shifting walls, the unease that permeates every one of its hallways, and how I never quite feel welcome or in charge in the Oldest House. I love that <em>Control </em>is one big ode to the era of creepypasta fiction that I grew up on, and how it treats that subject material with reverence. <strong>I could list near endless highlights from </strong><em><strong>Control</strong></em><strong>, a damn-near perfect video game if there ever were such a thing, but in order to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mysteries-are-the-heart-of-control-1844900378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mysteries-are-the-heart-of-control-1844900378"><strong>preserve its mysteries</strong></a></span><strong>, I will simply urge you to pick it up while it’s discounted to $8.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>By my estimation, I’m in the third act of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger</em></a></span><em> </em>at the moment and absolutely loving it. It’s been a great year for <em>Zelda</em>-like games, and this is pretty high up there. Developed by Furniture &amp; Mattress, <em>Arranger </em>follows Jemma who leaves behind the only life she’s known to explore the world outside their village’s walls. Only, Jemma’s excuse for living is that she’s never quite fit in, and for good reason: whenever she moves, the entire axis that she ambles along shifts with her. She quite literally exercises control over the world around her with every step she takes, much to the detriment of everyone around her. However, <em>Arranger </em>tracks her journey and how she comes to accept this confounding ability as a boon to be shared with others rather than the curse she believes it to be. It’s a sweet and short puzzler that adds a charming wrinkle to the tried-and-true formula of isometric action-adventure games like it, and it goes a long way to making <em>Arranger </em>stand apart in an otherwise crowded genre. <em><strong>Arranger </strong></em><strong>can be all yours for $15, and I can’t recommend it enough.</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/realmwalker-event-in-diablo-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As part of Season 6, Diablo 4 introduces us to a host of new mechanics, a total overhaul of countless game systems, and the introduction of the Realmwalker event. It’s an entirely new world event that appears regularly across Sanctuary, and if you’re brave enough to beat the forces of Hell, then you’ll earn sweet rewards for your—likely—Spiritborn. Here’s what you should know about the Realmwalker event in Diablo 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-new-realmwalker-event">What is the New Realmwalker Event?</h2>



<p>As the rage of Mephisto spreads across Sanctuary, so too do his forces of Hell. One of the most formidable enemies in his legion is the Realmwalker—a lumbering colossi that resembles an armored, demonic turtle with a portal to Oblivion on its back. They’re not as powerful as a World Boss, but still potent enough to cause problems.</p>



<p>If you can slay a Realmwalker, its corpse spawns a portal to the Seething Realm—a dungeon unique to this season that drops Seething Opal Elixiers.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-beat-the-realmwalker">How to Beat the Realmwalker</h2>



<p>The Realmwalker fight occurs across three stages, with the first stage proving the most annoying. To start with, the Realmwalker is utterly invulnerable to damage. You must defeat the Bloodhound Guardians protecting the Realmwalker to deal any damage. Then, the monster spawns Hatred Spires that power up its abilities. Defeat those promptly to squash its Kamehameha-like powers.</p>



<p>With the pillars eradicated, turn your attention on the demon spawn and start wailing on it with an axe or two until it falls.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-realmwalker-spawn">When Does the Realmwalker Spawn?</h2>



<p>These walking monstrosities spawn every 15 minutes in a random zone across Sanctuary. A second one appears in Nahantu every hour, giving players to the south a shot at defeating the beast. Check your map! There’s a brand-new green icon that indicates “Hatred Rising,” which is where you’ll find the Realmwalker.</p>



<p>Did you take down the Realmwalker yet? Let us know in the comments below, or share some tips for other players in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>!</p>

<p>While you’re busy taking down a Realmwalker, don’t forget to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-need-angelbreath-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep an eye out for Angelbreath</a>. You always need some for crafting elixirs!</p>

<p>Concord may be offline, but it doesn’t appear fully dead just yet. If you haven’t checked the Concord’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> page in weeks, you’ve likely missed that it has continued to see various updates on Steam. </p>



<p>Over the last few weeks, there have been multiple daily updates to the game on Steam. Since October 6, the game has seen 20 updates on Steam by various users such as “pmtest”, “sonyqae_shipping”, and “sonyqae”. It’s unknown what the updates are exactly, but there are rumors that the game could be looking to re-release as a free-to-play title.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Concord launched at the end of August to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 700 players</a> on Steam while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly selling just 25,000 copies</a> across PC and PlayStation 5. Just two weeks after its launch, the game was shut down by Sony and developer Firewalk Studios. After that, game director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his position</a>.</p>



<p>With the game reportedly taking eight years to develop and costing $400 million, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the game relaunched as a free-to-play title. The last time the game was available for players to play for free, however, the game saw a peak of just 2,388 players during an open beta.</p>







<p>There’s been no comment from PlayStation or Firewalk about what these updates could be for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-rumored-to-still-be-updating-on-steam-potential-to-go-free-to-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a completely new round of speculations, it's rumored that Concord is still continuing to be updated on Steam, with Sony updating Concord's game files via Steam's back-end, leading to rumors swirling that Concord will be making a return. Concord will go down in PlayStation's history, but not in a positive light like they were hoping. Instead, the game completely flopped and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">removed from the store</a> within weeks, and refunds were given to all who purchased the title. The rumor comes from Reddit, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g0gxi7/concord_files_are_still_being_updated_via_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows the exact files</a> that have been changed in the SteamDB for Concord, with the files being updated on October 8. Multiple industry professionals have commented on the Concord debacle, with many saying that going F2P is the only thing that could possibly save this game. However, there are also professionals who say that Concord is just completely dead in the water, with no chance of redemption.</p>
<p>Considering that Concord was a huge project for Sony, reportedly sinking millions of dollars into Concord, it makes sense that they would try their hardest to redeem this game, even if it seems that the general gaming audience also doesn't care much about whether it ends up saved or not. To be able to salvage a game as big as Concord, Sony would have to invest more money into the project, which, after how the game performed, is just not an option at this point.</p>
<p>In a genre that is already heavily saturated, it makes sense that a premium hero shooter didn't quite hit the mark. When games like Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Valorant exist, there are already plenty of options on the market for players, which begs the question of why would anyone pay for a premium hero shooter when there are free ones that could perform better and are more accessible for a larger audience?</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Concord will resurface as a free-to-play hero shooter in an attempt to scrape together some of the money that they funneled into the project, but it's uncertain territory right now, especially for Firewalk Studios, who were the developers of the game. It's said that they are bracing for mass layoffs, as Firewalk is one of the more expensive studios owned by Sony. Already, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/">Game Director of Concord</a> has stepped down, so it's possible that more are to follow. With how badly the launch of Concord went, some of the team are even expecting Firewalk to be closed down entirely.</p>
<p>If it goes free to play on Steam and PlayStation, it may just save the game by the skin of its teeth, but no one knows for sure.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monomyth-preview-dungeon-full-of-opportunity</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monomyth-preview-a-dungeon-full-of-opportunity.1006410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monomyth-preview-dungeon-full-of-opportunity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monomyth</em> is said to be inspired by the likes of old-school dungeon-crawler RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a>'s <em>King's Field</em>, along with classic immersive sims such as <em>Arx Fatalis</em>. Those games are a bit before my time, but if they invoke the same feelings of exploration and mystery as <em>Monomyth</em>, I have a couple more items to add to the gaming backlog.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-character.jpg?itok=y4niyLiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-character.jpg?itok=RgIvnVVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Choices, choices.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Will You Be in <em>Monomyth</em>?</h2>
<p>Indeed, if there ever was a game that captured the spirit of exploring an unknown, unfathomable dungeon, <em>Monomyth </em>is a crowning example. If I had to draw an even closer comparison, <em>Monomyth</em> feels like one giant<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/elder-scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a></em> dungeon, though this game is much more robust and open-ended.</p>
<p>This is precisely the reason why I'm excited to see how <em>Monomyth </em>develops throughout its Early Access duration. Strange obelisks, forgotten ruins, and decrepit crypts are the tip of the iceberg in <em>Monomyth</em>, and you'll explore all of these areas with your very own classless character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-church.jpg?itok=_NADI1yQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-church.jpg?itok=e1bAS-7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mind the dagger, Mr. Priest.</figcaption></figure><p>I emphasize classless, as the main character is not necessarily bound to a single archetype. You'll start this adventure by crafting your character, and this is primarily through the allocation of stats. You have RPG standards like strength, dexterity, and intelligence as attributes, but also a selection of skill points to further enhance your build.</p>
<p>Attributes are generally useful all around, but to fine-tune your character as you create them and after each level up, you'll want to allocate points into skill points such as athletics, stealth, speech, archery, types of magic, and more. It's almost a bit overwhelming since you're not entirely sure how effective said points are, but for the sake of the playthrough, I went for a more stealthy character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-douse.jpg?itok=GBnpg423 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-douse.jpg?itok=W5qBaaxh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even basic magic is possible, like Douse, which will put out open flames. Useful for stealthy types!</figcaption></figure><h2>Diving into the Dungeon of <em>Monomyth</em></h2>
<p>After a brief tutorial segment -- which sees our character get captured, thrown in jail, and escape from said jail in <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fashion-- we're thrown headfirst into <em>Monomyth</em>'s world. So far, at least, it's entirely underground, though this cave system comprises various fortresses, settlements, temples, and more.</p>
<p>There's a plot and objective that propels the player forward, but there's no urgency, and exploration is what <em>Monomyth</em> is all about. Since this is an immersive sim, many elements are interactable. It behooves the player to thoroughly search the area for items. Since I'm the stealthy type, I also specialized in lock picking, allowing me to find even more treasure.</p>
<p>Other immersive sim elements come into play as well; for example, wooden doors can be set on fire with a torch. Even if it's locked, you don't have to waste a lockpick. Just set fire to the door, and it'll fall apart (or just bash it with a weapon). Weapons, however, dull over time, so you'd then have to heat it up at a forge and use a hammer to hone its edge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-dungeon.jpg?itok=6A_HG_iX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-dungeon.jpg?itok=DQH5iJEi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This area seemed vastly different from the rest, and that's very intriguing to me.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain areas have hidden entrances that are accessible through player ingenuity, so it benefits the player to use a bit of observation and thinking to find various ways into buildings and areas that may seem otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p>Adding even more to the immersive sim elements, you can even cook your own food. Eating food raw makes you sick, so any fish or raw meat needs to be placed near a fire. I found a bakery in a fortress with raw pies and dough, and seeing them actually cook over time was satisfying.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-combat.jpg?itok=iUmTCRjM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-combat.jpg?itok=np9wXfJT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Genuinely, what did I do to deserve this?</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For My Life</h2>
<p>This cave is not without peril, however, as enemies and traps wait as I path my way through uncharted territory. Giant rats, Wastelanders (which are these orc-like enemies), and even human thugs are among the enemies you'll fight.</p>
<p>Combat is where <em>Monomyth</em> could use a lot of work. Combat is dull, plain and simple. It amounts to swinging your weapon and dodging and blocking attacks. Since I went for a stealthy build, I had hoped for a stealth attack bonus or something. Getting one free attack unnoticed is all well and good, but some of these enemies are quite tanky and deal an insane amount of damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-explosive.jpg?itok=xrvMqJKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-explosive.jpg?itok=SgfhmDif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I've had enough of dying -- time to break out the explosive barrel.</figcaption></figure><p>Things worked out a bit better once I found a rapier to replace my dagger, but as a game that advertises itself as classless, it should feel like any build is viable. Had I gone for a more magic-focused build, perhaps I would have found more success. By the time I found offensive magic, I was pretty deep into my melee build and it wasn't really viable to restart.</p>
<p>God forbid you come across multiple enemies. You might be lucky and find an explosive on the ground or something, but there's not much a player can do when you're hounded by a bunch of bandits. You could quite easily sneak past tougher enemies with a build like mine, but then there's less experience to be gained since I'm not slaying said enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-town.jpg?itok=g-oUBFUT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-town.jpg?itok=nG4s3fIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A town full of future possibilities?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monomyth </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I eventually found my way into a bigger area in what seemed like <em>Monomyth</em>'s first town. There doesn't seem to be a great deal to do here, and interacting with NPCs mostly leads nowhere. I can't help but think the developer, being a one-man operation, bit off more than they can chew in some areas. But when <em>Monomyth</em> works, like in its overall dungeon design, solving various puzzles and finding a powerful piece of loot, it's fantastic.</p>
<p>Throughout its Early Access period, it's my hope that combat is refined to be a bit more exciting and intricate, and that there's more life to its various NPCs and the towns they inhabit. There's already the foundation for a super intriguing, fun adventure with the various hidden areas and puzzles, so if the rest of the game is just as good, I'll be back for more <em>Monomyth</em> soon enough.</p>

<p>The next generation of Nvidia graphics cards are coming in January. According to a new report from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-rtx-5080-16-gb-rtx-5070-12-gb-ces-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wccftech</a>, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs will be announced at CES 2025 from Las Vegas. </p>



<p>This reveal will include the Nvidia RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070.</p>



<p>In addition to the report of a launch at CES, Wccftech also has information on expected specs for each card. All of the details come from the outlet’s sources, and should be taken with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can confirm or an official announcement is made.</p>



<p>One of the biggest bits of information from the report is that the RTX 5070 will have fewer cores and SMs than the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4070 Ti has 7,680 CUDA Cores with 60 SMs. If the chip reportedly being used on the RTX 5070 is fully enabled, it can support a max of 6,400 CUDA Cores and 50 SMs. That said, it’s worth noting that they are different generation graphics cards. Until we can actual test out they perform, it’s unknown how much of a difference there will be in performance.</p>

That great disturbance in the Force you just felt wasn't a million voices crying out in terror. It was, in fact, me crying out in terror a million times. You see, Aspyr have just announced that they're porting Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to PC and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443630/Star_Wars_Episode_I_Jedi_Power_Battles/">Steam</a>. I have a complicated relationship  with Jedi Power Battles, in the sense that I think I still have scars on my thumbs from when I played it all night on a busted PS1 controller. I have bled for this game. I'd close my eyes after each six-hours session and see fields of lightsabers flickering and dancing like luminous leeches, chasing me through the Dagobahnian jungles of my dreams.

<p>
Jedi Power Battles isn't even all that amazing. Originally published in 2000, it just happened to come along at a time when myself and a friend were obsessed with Jedi Knights and the seven lightsaber duelling forms. It was an atrocious period in my life, nestled squarely between my liverish career as a Trekkie and my later, more forgiveable spell in the labyrinths of Tolkien and Warhammer. I had a dedicated Jedi name, I think. Evaed Paleee? It is very important that I don't remember this era in great detail, so I'll be watching the below PC port trailer through squinting eyes and parted fingers. Here you go:

A quick overview: Jedi Power Battles is a scenic, fairly punishing 3D platformer-brawler that follows the events of the Phantom Menace movie, except that I don't remember Liam Neeson tumbling into pits quite so regularly, or Ewan McGregor being unable to hack through a Pilot Droid's forearms, or Samuel L Jackson getting launched by a little green man. The best thing about it is that you get a bunch of nicely animated Jedi movesets to, as the case may be, argue about till 3am, at which point it belatedly occurs to you that you've never been kissed in your whole adolescent life, and that your bedroom smells of mortality.
</p><p>
What are Aspyr doing with it all? Well, you can expect a choice of modern or classic controls, secret areas unlocked from the start, Vaselined visuals, cute flourishes such as Big Head mode, and a total of 13 returning and newly playable characters, including the Rifle Droid and Tusken Raider. It's out 23rd January. Here's hoping they give it a bit more time than they did the recent Battlefront port, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-devs-working-to-address-bugs-following-disastrous-launch">a planet-sized shambles</a>.

It filled up in seconds as players eagerly signed up to be guinea pigs for whatever the Mario maker is cooking up. No one knows for sure what that might be, but fans are already speculating based on some new clues.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“We will perform a test called Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program related to a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service offered for the Nintendo Switch system,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced yesterday</a></span>. It said the only requirements for acceptance were that users be 18 years old, have a registered Nintendo account, and an  active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p>The slots <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/IntroSpecktive/status/1844393893854577021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/IntroSpecktive/status/1844393893854577021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared to fill up</a></span> within seconds of applications going live. “Registration for this test is now full.

But those combing through the website were able to garner some additional info about the mysterious test. </p><p>According to dataminer OatmealDome, downloads for the special software would start the week of October 21 with the test going live on October 23. Users need at least 2.2GB free on their Switch’s internal storage. “Nintendo also recommends using TV mode and a wired connection during the test,” OatmealDome added.</p><p>That last part might be the most telling, and it has some fans thinking this might be a test for a new cloud streaming feature. That would explain why a wired connection is recommended and why users must have active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriptions. Presumably, if there was a cloud streaming feature, it would be paywalled behind that $50 a year membership. Or perhaps Nintendo would even use it to raise the price. Streaming could be used to play newer games that the Switch isn’t natively powerful enough to run, or even facilitate retro emulation for devices like the GameCube or Nintendo DS. </p><p>There have already been streaming experiments on Switch, though <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/17gqluf/resident_evil_2_cloud_trash/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/17gqluf/resident_evil_2_cloud_trash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they’ve rarely gone well</a></span>. The <em>Kingdom Hearts 1 </em>and <em>2</em> remasters, for example, are only available on Nintendo’s device via streaming, as is the <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake. It’s possible the new software might aim to remedy those shortcomings, or be part of a third-party partnership. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1693868974033756457?t=4b1Tmt1BioYa0xk6CTzchA&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1693868974033756457?t=4b1Tmt1BioYa0xk6CTzchA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft has the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games over Ubisoft+</a></span> as part of the Microsoft acquisition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-diablo-4-difficulty-levels/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The difficulty tiers are one of the most significant changes you’ll find going into the most recent season of Diablo IV. There are no longer World Tiers; instead, Blizzard took a step back and reintroduced the Torment system from Diablo 3. It’s straightforward enough on the surface, but you’ll soon find the game proves more challenging than ever before. Here’s what you need to know about the new Diablo 4 difficulty levels when creating a character in Season 6!</p>



<h2 id="h-an-overview-of-the-diablo-4-difficulty-levels">An Overview of the Diablo 4 Difficulty Levels</h2>



<p>Instead of jumping through World Tiers 1-4, Diablo 4 offers eight difficulty levels ranging from Normal to Torment IV. The higher up the scale you go, the better the rewards, but the more challenging the enemies. On Torment difficulty, the ARPG will challenge you, requiring you to prioritize proper build and gear planning.</p>



<h3 id="h-normal">Normal</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Default</li>



<li>Standard difficulty setting with baseline EXP and gold drops.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-hard">Hard</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Default</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 75% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 75% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-expert">Expert</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Complete the Prologue</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 125% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 125% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-penitent">Penitent</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Complete the original story campaign</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 175% more Experience</li>



<li>Monsters drop 175% more Gold</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-i">Torment I</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 20 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 300% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Ancestral items drop</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armor reduced by 250</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 25%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-ii">Torment II</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 35 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 400% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armor reduced by 500</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 50%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-iii">Torment III</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 50 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 500% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armored reduced by 750</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 75%</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-torment-iv">Torment IV</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unlock</strong>: Conquer The Pit of the Artificer – Tier 65 at Level 60</li>



<li>Monster kills grant 600% Gold and Experience</li>



<li>Increased Legendary, Unique, and Mythic drops</li>



<li>Armored reduced by 1000</li>



<li>Resistances reduced by 100%</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-torment-difficulties-in-diablo-4">How to Unlock Torment Difficulties in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly above, you can unlock the new Torment difficulties in Diablo 4 by progressing through the game until you reach the new max level of 60. From there, open up The Pit and progress deeper into the end-game mechanic until you reach Tier 65. Once you hit this point, you’ll unlock all Torment difficulties. </p>



<p>You only need to reach Tier 20 to unlock Torment I, though!</p>

Sign-ups went live on Thursday morning and the playtest quickly filled up. Now fans have to wait 10 days to learn what this program is all about.</p><p>Speculation around the program is already running, with some jokingly (?) suggesting that it might be an Arms 2 playtest or the <a href="https://x.com/juneybee03/status/1844147115448242359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return of the Miiverse</a>. Others wondered if it might have something to do with Nintendo Switch Online retro games, such as the release of GameCube games on the service.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/07/01/miiverse0724131280jpg-e930671280wjpg-9c6bd4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Could the Miiverse be making a comeback? It's just one of many theories being generated by fans right now.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"I want to believe Miiverse could be coming back. Limited numbers, different language regions, could definately be a test for moderation strategy etc.," journalist <a href="https://x.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1844396508650897829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Kate Dale wrote on X/Twitter</a>. "Test now, make it a launch day Switch 2 feature. Bring it back Nintendo!"</p><p>For those who don't recall, the Miiverse is a defunct service introduced on the Wii U. It was much-loved for the wholesome creativity that it generated from fans as well as its various online hooks. The service <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/29/nintendo-miiverse-to-shut-down-in-november">officially went offline in 2017</a>.</p><h2>What we know about the Nintendo Switch Online playtest</h2><p>Here's what we do know: Playest users must have have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership as of October 9. They must be 18 years of age or older, and they have to be registered in Japan, the U.S., the UK, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. The test download is 2.2GB.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to believe Miiverse could be coming back</p></div><p>Crucially, Nintendo appears to want players to play docked and with a strong Internet connection. This is leading some fans to theorize that Nintendo is testing a cloud-based streaming service for Switch games, similar to the kind offered by Xbox, PlayStation, and Nvidia.</p><p>As for whether it's Switch 2 related, the playtest <em>does </em>take place on the anniversary of the Nintendo Switch reveal on October 20, 2016. But with Nintendo's next-gen console still remaining elusive despite heavy rumors of an October reveal, we have to take pretty much every rumor to do with the Switch 2 with a grain of salt at the moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Feels like if it was a thing for something known. There is not much reason to keep it as just 'new feature' or NSO," one fan speculated on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-begins-oct-23-6-pm-pst-expansion-pack-tier-only-%E2%80%94-tl-dr-in-thread.11282/page-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famiboards</a>. "They’d probably just say it publicly like other stress test announcements in the past. It’s probably something new, but could range from really unexciting to something pretty hype that Nintendo announces in the week following the application closure."</p><p>One way or another, Nintendo fans will just have to sit tight and wait until the playtest kicks off on October 20. Maybe they can set the time on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">their new Alarmo</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sand-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If stomping your way across the desert on a giant, leggy, weaponized platform with a few of your best friends sounds like a good time, have I got a game for you. Especially if along the way you want to explore a ruined world, scavenge wrecks and ruins, take pot shots at other scavengers, and get in a few knock-down drag-out landship brawls with hostile crews with their own custom-built Trampler mechs.</p><p>That's just what goes down in Sand, an upcoming PvPvE survival shooter where you and your crew want to get down to the planet Sophie, get the goods while exploring the surface, and get out—hopefully making a profit in the process. The world is an alternate history before World War 1, so your gear and the world is all this riveted industrial stuff from the age of iron-clad dreadnoughts, old western revolver-rifles, trousers with suspenders, and some absolutely legendary facial hair. I was able to sit down and try a PvP only test build of Sand with some of the developers, showing off a game that has a clear design vision I think will really resonate with some gamers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Sand Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Taking a bold note from more crafting-heavy games like Rust, or from or map-based games like Sea of Thieves, Sand has a slower pace of events. Your Trampler can be pretty fast, depending on how you outfit it, but it still moves and turns like a great stomping ship. Spotting enemies in the distance by their smoke plume is one thing, but your pilot has to do a good job maneuvering and it always helps to have a navigator plotting the course. That's not to mention your real purpose for hitting the surface: loot. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Trampler battles are also slower-paced. It's a challenge just lining up targets as the gait of your mech throws off aim and the rolling dunes present a constant challenge in just getting a good  line of sight. </p></div><p>Shipwrecks and island towns litter the once-wet surface of planet Sophie, any of which could have the find that lets you strike it rich. Or the ammo and power cores that keep your ship going for another round of searches. Or the weapons and gear that outfit your crew for a boarding action against another ship that was more successful in finding riches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To get all that done you have to take a more methodical approach, and the controls reflect that. You can carry very little loot on your person before you need to find a container to hold it in instead, for example. You always have to aim before firing a weapon, which I found really helped differentiate the size and purpose difference between the pistol, revolver-rifle, and sniper rifle I found on the surface. (I found shotgun shells too…but no shotgun.) </p><p>Trampler battles are also slower-paced. It's a challenge just lining up targets as the gait of your mech throws off aim and the rolling dunes present a constant challenge in just getting a good  line of sight. Other Tramplers take a lot of hits from a cannon to go down, requiring you to destroy their engine room for real takedown—which depending on how good a shot you are might take more shells than you brought with you or found on the surface. But it's either that or board the enemy Trampler, kill the crew, and capture their helm to make it your own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With that much work and risk in a Trampler-on-Trampler brawl, you need to be sure it's worth it—because there's a real sting in spending ten or fifteen minutes chasing someone down to realize they just didn't have anything worth stealing. Not to mention the circumstance I can foresee players dreading the most: when a fight starts and the other salvage crews start circling like vultures to pick off whoever survives. That's a scenario I saw more than once through my binoculars.</p><p>Not for my crew, though! We had a giant Trampler to stomp around in, a ramshackle monster that the developers assured me was not something you can build with starting resources. And build it you do. A pretty robust, in-depth system of Trampler design lets you place sleeping compartments, the helm, storage facilities, the engines, decks, more engines, fighting balconies, fighting emplacements, and guns all over these things. You can even do cool stuff like customize where doors and hatches are located to make your ship a maze that enemies will struggle to invade. All of that takes resources you've gathered on the planet below and that you're—at least somewhat—risking when you take down your new steel behemoth for another run.</p><p>Which is something I already know I'll find myself doing whenever I next get my hands on Sand.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and score some great freebies.</p><p>Available right now, the first batch of games is a solid selection of action, puzzles, and musical fun. Some of the highlights here include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-straight-roads/" data-ref-id="5000-492251">No Straight Roads</a>, a rhythm-action game where you fight the good fight against an evil EDM empire, the over-the-top brutality of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-eternal/" data-ref-id="5000-483372">Doom Eternal</a>, and the multiplayer fun of paranormal extermination in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>. Would you kindly also look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bioshock/" data-ref-id="5000-22526">BioShock Remastered</a>, for a fresh tour of Rapture?</p><p>Starting October 17, there'll be five more games to add to your library, although there aren't too many noteworthy titles here. Since it is the horror season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killing-floor-2/" data-ref-id="5000-272955">Killing Floor 2</a> is a savage option to consider in case you have a digital bloodlust, while the two-pack of Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol is a 16-bit blast from the past where you can save people from the undead, chainsaw-wielding killers, mummies, and other spooky monsters.</p><p>When October 24 rolls around, things get even spookier with this wave of games. The creepiest one here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stasis-bone-totem/" data-ref-id="5000-521983">Stasis: Bone Totem</a>, an unnerving and atmospheric underwater adventure with classic point-and-click gameplay. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gargoyles/" data-ref-id="5000-16237">Gargoyles Remastered</a> is a revival of the '90s classic 16-bit platformer with improved graphics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-gunk/" data-ref-id="5000-516158">The Gunk</a> is a more relaxing tale of a pair of opportunists cleaning up a planet infected with parasitic filth.</p><p>Finally, October 31 ends the month with a bang. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deaths-door/" data-ref-id="5000-529059">Death's Door</a>, one of the best indie games of 2021, is an isometric action-adventure where you'll play as an adorable crow armed with a sword and set loose in a mysterious world. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/scorn/" data-ref-id="5000-455808">Scorn</a> has a few shortcomings in its design, but when it comes to gross-out visuals that would make HR Giger proud, it's in a class of its own. There's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence/" data-ref-id="5000-465637">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, an incredible story with <em>too many rats </em>and the cheeky Pokemon-like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/coromon/" data-ref-id="5000-506718">Coromon</a> to close the month out with.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for October 2024</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li>Hive Jump Survivors</li><li>SCARF</li><li>Tomb Raider: Legend</li><li>The Eternal Cylinder</li><li>Spirit of the North</li><li>No Straight Roads</li><li>BioShock Remastered</li><li>Doom Eternal</li><li>DreadOut 2</li><li>Ghostbusters: Spirit Unleashed - Ecto Edition</li><li>Priest Simulator: Vampire Show</li><li>The Gap</li></ul><h3>October 17</h3><ul><li>Mystery Box: Hidden Secrets</li><li>Vlad Circus: Descend into Madness</li><li>Through the Darkest of Times</li><li>Killing Floor 2</li><li>Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol</li></ul><h3>October 24</h3><ul><li>Pumpkin Jack</li><li>The Gunk</li><li>Stasis: Bone Totem</li><li>Gargoyles Remastered</li><li>Monster Train</li><li>Morbid: The Seven Acolytes</li></ul><h3>October 31</h3><ul><li>A Plague Tale: Innocence</li><li>Death's Door</li><li>Haunted Hotel: Personal Nightmare Collector's Edition</li><li>Scorn</li><li>Coromon</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in October via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>Amid Evil</li><li>Valfaris</li><li>Perish</li><li>Dr. Fetus' Mean Meat Machine</li><li>Tormented Souls</li><li>Dusk</li><li>Mortal Shell</li><li>Doomblade</li><li>Monster Harvest</li><li>Alien: Isolation</li><li>XDefiant</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Lego Fortnite</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royal</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">In 2022, Color Gray Studio and Playstack dropped The Case Of The Golden Idol--a point-and-click investigation game centered around the titular gilded totem--and it quickly became a smash hit. Now, after announcing the follow-up at last year's The Game Awards, Color Gray and Playstack have confirmed that The Rise Of The Golden Idol will launch on November 12, while a new demo is available on Steam today.</p><p dir="ltr">The Rise Of The Golden Idol continues the story of the cursed curio, as it takes place in the 1970s--300 years after the Cloudsley family's exploits in the first game. The new story follows a relic hunter who has heard stories about the Golden Idol, and they've decided to seek out the ancient artifact for themselves.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Blizzard Entertainment was reportedly toiling away on a mobile version of Overwatch in the past, though it's unknown whether the project is still in active development. A new book about the acclaimed developer--titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment/dp/1538725428?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>--drops the little nugget of info about the hero-shooter series.</p><p dir="ltr">In the book, author Jason Schreier references an Overwatch mobile project when talking about Walter Kong. Here is the passage from Play Nice: "Overwatch was led by Walter Kong, who oversaw the release of regular heroes and content for Overwatch 2 as well as new projects, like a mobile version of the franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">There has been no official comment on a mobile edition of the Overwatch franchise. Overwatch 2 launched last year as a free-to-play game for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The title offers cross-platform play, so it's possible a mobile project would be the same experience but for smartphones and tablets, or it could be something completely different, if it still exists at all.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1884405246" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
