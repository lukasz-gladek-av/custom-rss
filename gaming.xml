            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming spherical platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be getting DLC themed around everyone's favorite blue spiny critter Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as three of his buddies.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, Sega reveals that Sonic, as well as Tails, Amy, and Knuckles, will be available to purchase as separate DLC for&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble</em>, and they'll also be included in the game's Sega Pass.</p>

<p>It's pretty fitting that Sonic and his friends will be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>given the game's adoption of the Spin Dash move; I guess Sonic might have considered suing AiAi and company if he hadn't been handed this opportunity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=Hf14_j-T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc-characters.jpg?itok=wZXyqJC7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Four&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>characters will join&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>as DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the four&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters outlined above, the Sega Pass for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>will also net you access to two more "Sega all-stars", and they've all got their own unique stats as well.</p>

<p>You'll also get some new customization items to trick out your monkeys, although we're not sure what those customization items might be yet. Hopefully, they include a nightmarish&nbsp;Sonic wig of some description.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball&nbsp;</em>series, which I suppose is best described as a platforming franchise, although it's complicated. Amusingly enough, it's being developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, best-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the games, they're essentially&nbsp;<em>Marble Madness</em>-style romps in which you must guide a monkey in a ball around a series of increasingly treacherous courses.</p>

<p>The difficulty can, in my experience, get pretty controller-breakingly frustrating, although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-monkey-ball-banana-blitz-hd-review">not every game subscribes to that philosophy</a>.</p>




<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is set to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on June 25th. No other platforms have been announced for the game yet.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed portion of the Sega Pass arrives sometime this year, so look out for it if you're a fan of the Blue Blur.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix is continuously adding to its diverse portfolio of games, announcing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171306/on-a-multi-national-tv-and-movie-streaming-service-there-lived-a-hobbit">a new slate of titles set to launch on the platform this summer and beyond</a>. And while the “serious gamer” might be enticed by the pending arrival of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a><em> </em>or <em>Don’t Starve Together</em> — games that have enjoyed success on other platforms — it’s interactive fiction games that are the most exciting both for Netflix and its gaming community.</p><p>“Expanding the worlds of beloved Netflix series and films is our greatest opportunity in games,” <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-reality-universe-expands-with-new-games">wrote Leanne Loombe</a>, head of external games at Netflix, in a recent blog post.</p><p>Everybody’s getting into gaming right now. <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, LinkedIn, YouTube, and now possibly even Uber are offering games as a part of their services in order to drive subscriptions and user engagement. For some, <a href="https://digiday.com/media/the-next-level-for-us-the-new-york-times-eyes-longer-play-sessions-for-games-in-subscription-drive/">it’s working</a>. For others, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">not</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/13/23959224/amazon-gaming-layoffs-crown-content-channel">so</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23328568/facebook-gaming-mobile-app-shutting-down-october-2022">much</a>. A lot of these gaming initiatives feel like they’re just being tacked on to whatever service, like how your favorite Chinese takeout restaurant also has fries and chicken wings. Even though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn’s new games are entertaining</a>, it’s hard to imagine folks spending more time on the site where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/business/ceo-crying-linkedin-layoffs.html#:~:text=When%20he%20started%20bawling%2C%20moments,a%20teary%20selfie%20for%20LinkedIn.&amp;text=Braden%20Wallake%2C%20the%20chief%20executive,after%20laying%20off%20two%20employees.">CEOs announce layoffs like YouTube apology videos</a> just to play them.</p><p>But Netflix is unique in that, even though it’s not a gaming company, its products do lend themselves to a specific kind of highly popular but underserved gaming experience. “We’ve seen a lot of success with interactive fiction games like <em>Selling Sunset</em>, <em>Perfect Match</em>, and <em>The Ultimatum</em>,” Loombe said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Reality television shows are still one of the most popular kinds of entertainment. They’re relatively cheap to produce and are uniquely positioned to create the kinds of high-drama moments that go viral on social media. And with popular shows, its audience is naturally incentivized to seek out related content. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the wild success of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV show</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">the games exploded in popularity</a>, appearing on bestseller lists and at the top of Steam player charts.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix’s gaming offerings are poised to take advantage of that same phenomenon. Because where a <em>Fallout</em> fan has to go outside Amazon to play the games (or, as Amazon vainly hopes, use its cloud gaming service Luna) Netflix’s games channel the enthusiasm of a show’s community right back into the app, creating what Loombe calls a seamless “connective tissue between the TV show and the game.” In this new economy of attention, where companies are competing to have as many eyeballs on their apps or services as possible, that Netflix fans don’t have to leave the app to continue their fandom experiences is potentially a huge advantage.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>MCU, meet the NRU — the Netflix Reality Universe.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Netflix</cite></p></div><p>Another advantage is the games themselves. Adapting games can be tough, with the results often failing to engage an audience with the same level of success as its original. <em>Uncharted</em> was a critically acclaimed adventure game series; the movie — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22937238/uncharted-movie-review">less so</a>. That quality gap is closing with shows like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23543145/hbo-the-last-of-us-review"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>. And Netflix is strategic in how it picks which of its shows to adapt into a game to ensure an experience that faithfully recreates the essence of the show.</p><p>“Unscripted reality shows are really great because it has that fantasy element,” Loombe said. “Players are able to pretend to be one of those characters and play that fantasy out like a choose your own adventure and a romance novel combined.” </p><p>It’s a fantasy players take with them and share elsewhere. <em>Too Hot to Handle</em>, for instance,  has a dedicated community on Reddit with traditions like “Main Character Monday” in which players post pictures of their in-game avatars.&nbsp;“We have a really deep customization system in <em>Too Hot To Handle</em>,” Loombe explained. “So you can choose, from a variety of different items, to prosthetics, to different hairstyles, different hair colors, and body types. It really is quite deep.”</p><p>Netflix’s gaming library <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices">started with titles like<em> Shooting Hoops</em>, <em>Teeter (Up)</em>, and <em>Card Blast</em></a>. Three years later, it’s grown into one that includes big-name commercial powerhouses and indie-developed critical darlings. We only know what Netflix shares about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far">exactly how popular its games are</a>, and as a proportion of its overall user base, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-less-than-1-of-netflixs-total-subscribers-play-games-daily#:~:text=As%20reported%20by%20CBNC%2C%20this,downloaded%2070.5%20million%20times%20worldwide.">Netflix’s gaming audience is quite small</a>. And while Netflix’s interactive fiction games don’t generate the same kind of attention the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> trilogy or <em>Hades</em> might, they are quietly one of the platform’s biggest success stories.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first game, released in 2018, began life as a Switch exclusive, before gradually finding its way to PC in 2019, then Xbox One in 2021. But a PlayStation version never appeared. Come 2023, <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> was simultaneously released on Switch, PC and...PlayStation. Huh?</p><p>Both Sony and Microsoft love a good exclusive. Sometimes  each company will get publishers and developers to agree to at least a timed period where a game can only be played on their own console. The theory being, if you’re trying to choose between an Xbox or a PlayStation, you’ll pick the one that plays the most games you’re interested in. But while this theoretically benefits the consoles, it’s only a short-term win for the developers, who need to be sure the financial incentives will match the potential loss of half of all possible console sales.</p><p>But the real losers are us, the players, the people who own the “wrong” console. And that has been especially the case when it comes to those who own either am Xbox or a PS4/5 who want to enjoy the <em>Octopath</em> franchise.

            <title><![CDATA[ZOTAC ZONE: Another Handheld Gaming Device Has Appeared]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-zone-another-handheld/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zotac-zone-another-handheld-gaming-device-has-appeared.890220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-zone-another-handheld/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>That’s right – there’s another one. In a series of images that have surfaced from Computex 2024, another handheld gaming device has been showcased – the ZOTAC ZONE. From ZOTAC Gaming, the ZONE is another Windows-powered device with substantial specifications packed under a 120 Hz OLED screen, but this is just the latest in an increasingly long line of devices targeting the growing handheld gaming market.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>During Computex 2024, the ZOTAC ZONE was shown off, but the device just doesn’t look ‘nice enough’ to compete with the likes of the MSI Claw – which is undergoing a mid-gen refresh – or the ASUS ROG Ally, which has an upgraded model hitting the market very soon.</p>



<p>The specifications can’t be discredited, though. The ZOTAC ZONE features a 7-inch AMOLED display pulling 800 nits, and that sits atop a Ryzen 7 8840U processor with integrated Radeon 780M graphics. It’s not terrible, but it only has 16 GB of LPDDR5X memory, which means that it’s already beaten by the ROG Ally X. It also features ‘at least’ 512 GB of storage, while the upgraded ASUS ROG handheld boasts a 1 TB capacity.</p>



<p><strong>Furthermore</strong>, the ZOTAC ZONE’s 48.5 Wh battery isn’t anywhere near as powerful as the new one found in the ASUS ROG Ally X, which was boosted to a whopping 80 Wh to account for a shortfall in the original model. It has been claimed that the ZOTAC ZONE will retail at around $799 when it’s released in September 2024, but it’s joining a saturated market and it’s not even as good as the closest competitors, so only time will tell how it performs.</p>

This version of the headset features 3D positional audio, hand tracking, and haptic feedback in a wireless frame.

The majority of those that will be affected – 70 of the 95 – work at the studio's Montreal, Canada, office, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/behaviour-to-lay-off-up-to-95-employees"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for why, the company cites restructuring as it pursues a clarified vision around "multiple strategic changes." Behaviour says these layoffs will not affect its service business or its development on Dead by Daylight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To pursue this clarified vision [lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment], Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources," a <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">press release</a> reads. "As a result of these changes, the company will reduce its team by up to 95 employees, 70 of whom are based in Montreal. Each of these individuals offered valuable contributions to Behaviour, and will be fully supported by the organization in pursuing the next step in their careers."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outside of Dead by Daylight development, Behaviour is helping The Quarry developer Supermassive Games develop <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/the-casting-of-frank-stone-is-supermassives-single-player-horror">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, a single-player horror game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These layoffs arrive a few months after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/18/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-interactive-has-reportedly-laid-off-45-people">the studio laid off roughly 45 people at the same Montreal office back in January</a>&nbsp;and join an ever-growing list of disheartening layoffs and studio closures in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cities-skylines-ii-garbage-performance-roadblock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> ended up falling flat on its face </a>on day one, but that’s not to say the game won’t be fixed in due time, thankfully. Following a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/colossal-order-patches-cities-skylines-2-to-fix-garbage-problem-maybe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of prior fixes</a>, the Colossal Order has now outlined the upcoming Economy 2.0 rework, and it’s a hoot.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Or, at least, it <em>should</em> be a hoot if it all pans out properly. As per <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/economy-2-0-dev-diary-1.1682626/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colossal Order’s latest developer blog</a>, the Economy 2.0 system rework is supposed to be a complete and comprehensive rebalance of how the game handles its monetary progression. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">“Our goal with Economy 2.0 was to make the systems more straightforward and responsive, so you can make more meaningful choices and have more control over the various gameplay aspects,” read the Colossal Order blog. “This means fewer safeguards and automated systems that work invisibly under the surface and an increased level of challenge.” </p>
 <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="48" data-injectable="false">Good stuff so far, but what are the <em>specifics</em>?<br></p> <figure data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Colossal Order</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-economy-2-0-update-for-cities-skylines-2-is-coming-soon" data-injectable="false">Economy 2.0 update for Cities: Skylines 2 is coming soon</h2> <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Generally speaking, <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>‘s Economy 2.0 is supposed to do all of the following (and then some):</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Outright remove all Government Subsidies</li> <li>Make the ‘Importing City Services’ feature fully optional, with a fee when toggled on.</li> <li>Meaningfully increase the upkeep costs of all city services.</li> <li>Improve the demand calculations of your cities and communities.</li> <li>Introduce new rent and household spending calculations, allowing citizens to live in Low Density Residential areas.</li> <li>Rebalance the production chain to make taxed income more reasonable, in the grand scheme of things.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true">It’s curious, perhaps, that Colossal Order aims to simply take Government Subsidies out of the game. The feature is, in fact, a <em>thing</em> in the real world, so taking it out of the equation instead of attempting to retrofit it into something that makes sense is a tad strange. Yet, it should be better than the Economy 1.0 version, where Subsidies could easily remove the need to worry about money entirely. </p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">A potential red flag, if you wish to take it that way, is that Colossal Order also noted that “[they] still aim for the game to be playable without paying too much attention to where and how money and resources flow in the city so new players have a chance to succeed, while still leaving room for experienced players to benefit from optimizing their city.” There’s a multitude of ways we could understand this statement, but for the time being, I do recommend keeping a pinch of salt at hand.</p>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="false">Economy 2.0 won’t fix <em>all</em> of <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>‘s problems, of course, but it should serve as a solid baseline for Colossal Order to build upon (har har, I know) in the future. It’s obviously less than ideal, given the launch-day state of the game, but I’m personally just thrilled that the game isn’t going to suffer <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-workers-will-reportedly-be-out-of-work-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the same fate as <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a> did. It’s the little things.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Big News Outlets Keep Forgetting They Hate Video Games]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/variety-gaming-coverage</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-news-outlets-keep-forgetting-they-hate-video-games.890199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/variety-gaming-coverage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago, Nathan and I wrote about how <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone was getting back into games journalism</a>, after previously shuttering a games vertical in 2017. Now, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/variety-gaming-jennifer-maas-1236023968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>–which also had and then <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/variety-to-shut-down-their-entire-gaming-section-effective-just-after-e3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory-holed</a> dedicated games coverage–is taking a page from the same playbook.</p><p>It’s not an entire vertical; rather, the outlet is promoting writer Jennifer Maas, who’s <a href="https://variety.com/author/jennifer-maas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already been covering games</a>, to “lead the entertainment news brand’s <strong>heightened coverage</strong> of the video game industry.” (Emphasis mine.) Maas will focus in particular on the growing overlap between games and television, alongside another writer, Kaare Eriksen, who writes about games for Variety's <a href="https://variety.com/vip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid subscription</a> service.</p><p>Cynthia Littleton, <em>Variety</em>’s co-editor-in-chief, is quoted in the announcement as saying, “Gaming of all kinds has grown into a worldwide force and we’re eager to<strong> expand our coverage</strong> of this important market.” (Emphasis mine again.) It’s likely games have re-attracted Variety’s attention through the popularity of shows like HBO’s<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and Amazon’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/fallout-tv-show-impressions-aftermath-hours-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em></a>, as big game publishers embrace these medium crossovers and look at everything through the lens of IP. As stalwarts like the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/marvel-slowing-down-output-to-a-couple-of-films-and-series-a-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MCU slow</a>, and as box office sales <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/cinema-box-office-decline-2024-1235963134/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falter</a>, games probably feel like an untapped frontier to editors and media execs who haven’t been paying attention to them lately, even if none of this is remotely new.</p><p>I want to be really, <em>really</em> clear that I have no axes to grind against Maas or Eriksen, whose work I am not familiar with and whom I wish all the best; any journalist having good news about their job or their beat these days is worth celebrating. Rather, it’s the <em>situation</em> that made me scream when I saw this announcement–quotes about heightening and expanding coverage of an area Variety decided wasn’t worth it anymore in 2019, but has suddenly decided matters again, enough to ask new journalists to commit to a beat these outlets have already shown they can’t commit to.</p><p>That outlets like Rolling Stone, Variety, and <a href="https://game.substack.com/p/why-the-new-york-times-returned-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> are wandering back into the games game at a time when dedicated games journalism outlets are being <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-jason-schreier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimated</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right</a> <em>should</em>, in some ways, feel like a win. They could spell more opportunities for freelancers or even staffers. Big outlets with big resources can produce high-quality work that’s held to high standards, work that serves readers and tells important stories, the kind of work that dedicated games outlets can struggle to do in the face of dwindling resources, the loss of experienced writers and editors, and hostile ownership. I want so badly to feel <em>happy</em> that this is happening, even if these new/old forays are rising from the ashes of thousands of laid-off games journalists and degraded or shuttered outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>To detour into another part of journalism for a moment: On Sunday night, The Washington Post announced a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/06/02/sally-buzbee-steps-down-executive-editor-washington-post-matt-murray-rob-winnett-take-editorial-leadership-roles-new-newsroom-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise editorial shakeup</a> with the departure of executive editor Sally Buzbee and the reveal of a new “third newsroom” that intends to give readers “who feel traditional news is not for them… compelling, exciting and accurate news where they are and in the style that they want…. [moving] away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.” Semafor’s Max Tani <a href="https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1797667088804560929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter </a>that Post CEO Will Lewis told staff ‘You haven't done it’... when asked about reaching new audiences through the current newsroom structure.” According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/washington-post-shakeup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a>, Lewis told staff, “It’s the most important thing: untapped audiences.” Lewis also reportedly said that he'll be "sourcing talent externally" for this new newsroom, just months after The Post undertook <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2023/10/10/washington-post-staff-buyouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of buyouts.</a></p><p>If you read this site, you’re aware that Aftermath co-founders Nathan Grayson and I both worked for The Post’s games vertical Launcher, which was <a href="https://kotaku.com/washington-post-launcher-layoffs-giant-bomb-games-media-1850025471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shuttered</a> in January 2023, a few months after I was hired to run it. We were, to my understanding, succeeding in our goals and reaching the new, young readers The Post wanted to attract. After Launcher closed, I moved to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2021/08/04/washington-post-launch-next-generation-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire department</a> dedicated to reaching those new audiences. The head of that department, a brilliant thinker and exceptional boss who was far kinder to me than I deserved, now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2024/02/20/phoebe-connelly-named-senior-editor-ai-strategy-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heads up</a> The Post’s forays into AI; the February announcement of this move refers to our department in the past tense.</p><p>So I look out over the last few weeks of journalism news, at these Rolling Stone and Variety announcements, at The Post’s pivot into buzzword chaos, and I feel like I’m yelling at a character in a horror movie as they walk into a basement. These companies asked journalists to do our jobs, and we did them, and then everything we did got wiped away. And then, months or years later, these same bosses decide to reinvent the things we already did, just without us, and dress it up like some bold new idea. </p><p>I don’t think it’s cynical to predict where this leads: in a few months, or in a year or two, they’ll get bored of the people who replaced us, or the line won’t go up fast enough, and they’ll nuke the whole thing all over again. They’ll blame a lack of reader interest, or advertising shifts, or–as Lewis <a href="https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1797681312394080709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seems</a> to do–the writers and their work, but they’ll never take the blame themselves. And then they’ll move on to their next half-baked idea, and we’ll all pay the price.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24171470/dungeon-meshi-apothecary-diaries-gremlin-girls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="In1WDZ">Between<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24146605/delicious-in-dungeon-video-game-inspirations"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>’s feral cat girl Izutsumi and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24074811/best-anime-2024"><em>The Apothecary Diaries</em></a>’ weirdo poison taster Mao Mao, I’m absolutely thriving with current-wave chaotic little anime gremlin girls. </p>
<p id="B9PAb5">It’s very common for shonen anime to feature heavily sexualized female characters. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/17/22278866/jujutsu-kaisen-women">Yes, there are exceptions</a>, but it’s such a regular occurrence that boob close-ups and panty shots almost become background noise. So, seeing characters who could otherwise fit in those tropes do a total 180 to be completely nonsexual — and, in fact, repulsive — is so damn satisfying. </p>
<p id="tqeuuI">Izutsumi and Mao Mao aren’t the only characters to ever fit this bill, but watching the two shows in succession really scratched a good itch for me, kicking off the summer anime season with a growl. They join the canon of freaky gremlin gals with <em>Skip and Loafer</em>’s Mitsumi, an ambitious but totally awkward and kinda cringe high school student; the trio of budding animators at the center of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/16/21138309/keep-your-hands-off-eizouken-anime-studios-working-conditions"><em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em></a>; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/20/20812920/best-anime-studio-bones-carole-and-tuesday-my-hero-academia-fullmetal-alchemist"><em>Ouran High School Host Club</em></a>’s Haruhi, the tired scholarship student who puts up with all the host club’s extravagant bullshit. </p>

<p id="iuYzQA">None of these characters are designed in a traditionally “sexy” way; in fact, they’re aggressively unsexy. They get to be little weirdos, delighting in their interests and ambitions, without thinking about being appealing or pandering to their crushes (and in the case of Mitsumi and Haruhi, that’s exactly what gets their love interests’ attention!). It’s vindication for weird girls everywhere! </p>
<p id="lWGMH2">Izutsumi and Mao Mao take the trope from the slice-of-life genre to fantasy and historical settings, where female characters typically suffer from hypersexualization. </p>
<p id="P8DkXU">In the fantasy world of <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, none of the female characters are really sexualized at all. But Izutsumi stands out — because in any other show, she <em>would</em> be turned into a sexpot. Izutsumi is a cat girl, but not in the traditional <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyCatPerson">sexy feline person way</a>. She’s not purring up against other characters or seductively twitching her tail. And she doesn’t have any logic-defying cleavage. Even when she strips down in front of the group as they all enjoy an impromptu sauna, her body is remarkably nonsexualized. Instead, she <em>acts</em> like a feral cat: She’s distrustful, angry, and <em>will</em> claw your eyes out if you get too close. She’s slowly learning to trust the group, but like with a stray cat you leave food out for in your backyard, it will be on her terms. </p>

<p id="DZJeY1">The courtesans and concubines living in <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>’<em> </em>Imperial China are women who are very specifically using their sexuality to make a living in some way, shape, or form. Mao Mao, however, is an apothecary who <em>loves </em>to try out new medications and poisons. She tests them on herself, which means her arms are bandaged up with the results of her experiments. Nothing makes her happier than rare medicinal herbs and ingredients (except maybe poisons). When she’s not absolutely feral, she’s cold and calculating, an analytical mastermind who must switch gears from medical mysteries to political machinations. Either way, she’s not concerned about being sexy or likable, even when handsome head eunuch Jinshi flirts with her. </p>
<p id="zEyEVB">Izutsumi, Mao Mao, and the rest of these grubby anime girls are just the refreshing dunk of water I needed. <em>Delicious in Dungeon </em>wraps up this week, and <em>The Apothecary Diaries </em>ended in March, but I’m going to be bringing this freaky little chaos demon energy into the summer with me. No need to look hot in a bikini if my beach plans involve running up and down the shoreline, pretending to be a sandpiper. Mao Mao would be proud. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-will-need-a-psn-account-on-steam-and-epic/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Weeks ago, players were left stewing in their disappointment when a Sony-backed update to Helldivers 2 made it mandatory to link a PSN account to a Steam profile to play the game online. It was met with rampant resistance from the global gaming community, and within a matter of hours, a quarter of a million negative reviews for Helldivers 2 had surfaced on Steam.</p>



<p>The decision was ultimately reversed, but that wasn’t – and isn’t – the end of the story. Recently, it was found that Concord, an upcoming team-based first-person shooter, will also require a PSN account to be linked on Steam and the Epic Games Store before users can jump in online. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-what-s-the-big-deal">But What’s The Big Deal?</h2>



<p>A report <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mauvaise-nouvelle-pour-cette-prochaine-sortie-multijoueur-de-playstation-sur-pc-52313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Dealabs’ billbil-kun</a> confirmed through an investigation that <strong>Concord will need a PSN account</strong> to be played online – even if you’re playing it on Steam or through the Epic Games Store. This is a big deal because the PlayStation Network isn’t available in a whopping 177 countries worldwide, thus wiping out a huge portion of the global gaming market. </p>



<p>It’s shooting Concord in the foot before it has been released, and the immediate response to the newly revealed game wasn’t that strong in the first place.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>From the moment Concord was revealed at the recent State of Play showcase, the community started labelling it a ‘poor man’s Overwatch’. It certainly smacks of Blizzard’s hero-based FPS, and there are elements of Guardians of the Galaxy mixed in there too. It’s the debut title from Firewalk Studios and it has been in development for quite some time, but the reveal wasn’t what users expected.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1798006904150458559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Remedy teased something for June 7, 2024, related to the anticipated Alan Wake 2 Night Springs DLC.</p>



<p>The post invites fans to “join the percolation on June 7th…in Night Springs.” Is also playfully reassures that Dark Triangle Coffee is “just coffee, nothing else.”</p>



<p> Last March, organizers confirmed that Summer Game Fest will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">premiere on June 7</a> this year, starting at 5 pm EST / 10 pm GMT. This directly coincides with the date in Remedy’s new post. </p>



<p>This strongly implies that Remedy has big news for Night Springs during Summer Game Fest. That may include both a new trailer and a release window or date. However, Remedy did not confirm exactly what reveals are coming.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Remedy previously appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-remedy-games-teasing-alan-wake-2-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tease the Night Springs DLC</a> after updating its various social accounts last week. </p>



<p>The studio updated its Twitter/X and YouTube accounts to Poison Pill Entertainment with the tease “Since 1995 Night Springs City.”</p>



<p>Fans got an early look at some of the potential content coming to Alan Wake 2’s Night Springs DLC after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamined leaks surfaced</a>. The leaks also appeared to reveal details about the second expansion, The Lake House, and alternate endings.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 was an enormous success, and Remedy even confirmed it was their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game ever</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bryan-furys-infamous-laugh-kicked-off-dialogue-in-the-tekken-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Katsuhiro Harada, chief developer of the Tekken series, has offered a fascinating insight into the making of the fighting game franchise’s characters, specifically their dialogue — and in the process revealed why one Tekken character in particular became popular despite saying nothing at all.</p><p>Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1798164766806155521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in response to one user who asked about a line of dialogue spoken by the character Reina in the recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, but the answer went on to describe the process of adding dialogue to Tekken characters, kicking off with Bryan and Yoshimitsu in 1997’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3">Tekken 3</a>. Before that game, Tekken characters did not speak, but it was felt that with the demise of the arcade scene in the West and a shift toward consoles, there was a need to strengthen characterization.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This is when Bryan’s famous “Muwahaha!” laugh comes in, but only when the camera was not pointed at the character's face as much as possible due to hardware limitations.</p><p>“So I decided to include dialogue such as laughter or yes!! in the throwing scene where Bryan turns his back to the camera's gaze and in the scene where Bryan is down (and Nina stomps),” Harada said. “I also wanted to express Bryan's character as both a sadist and a masochist.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I also wanted to express Bryan's character as both a sadist and a masochist.</p></div><p>Subsequent Tekken games released on more powerful hardware added more characterization, although, as Harada points out, there’s an irony in Bryan becoming a character known for not speaking much at all. Another Tekken character who does not speak is Dragunov, and Harada offered an insight into how that came to be — and revealed his surprise at the character’s popularity despite his silence.</p><p>In short, Dragunov was designed as the “negative” to Lili’s “positive”, with the expectation that Dragunov would not be a popular character, whereas Lili would be. Indeed, Harada asked the developers to “keep his personality down, keep him plain, and he doesn’t need to be so popular.”</p><p>And so, Dragunov does not speak in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-5-dark-resurrection">Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection</a>, the 2005 update to Tekken 5 in which he was introduced. This also helped lighten the load on the development team, as Dragunov had few facial animations, very little lip-sync, and no more dialogue to localize.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Harada said he was nervous about Dragunov because he had become “soooo plain and brooding.” But then something unexpected happened: “the sober Dragunov, who did not speak at all, on the contrary, became popular among Tekken players because he was unique.”</p><p>The conclusion: times have changes, Harada suggested.</p><p>“In the 90s, if you didn't have characters speaking dialogue as soon as possible, ‘they wouldn't have any characterization!’ I thought.</p><p>“But I see, in a world where it is normal for game characters to speak after a generational change, I learned the opposite, that not speaking is also a matter of individuality.</p><p>“And even today, it is rare to find a fighting game character who does not say a word at all while fighting, at the start of a round, or throughout the entire win-pose (even Kuma and Panda communicate). Is there any other fighting game character that doesn't talk as much as Dragunov?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is not "iisou" but "iizo" (like “iizoou!” a little stronger than "iizo!"). The nuance is NOT JUST "That's good," but includes a "Good! Go ahead, I dare you!”.</p><p>Originally, this specification was developed by me during the development of TEKKEN3, when Nina made a specific… <a href="https://t.co/lQqTCbuOfh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lQqTCbuOfh</a></p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1798164766806155521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>So there you have it! Harada just dropped Tekken deep lore, delighting veteran fans of the series. But this isn’t the only hot topic Harada has discussed on social media recently. This week, months after he was made painfully aware of fans’ grassroots movement to get an official Waffle House stage in the long-running fighting game series, and having received tons of information about the American Southern diner chain via memes, viral videos, and earnest replies from fans, Harada said he was still baffled at the “culture” of Waffle House.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Almost every mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is fun as long as you’re with a squad that plays the objective and doesn’t actively try to kill you. However, that fun can dissipate quickly when it comes to extraction, the simplest part of any mission that often causes the most issues. </p> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Extraction from a mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em> shouldn’t be difficult, but it is more often than not. You might end up missing the Pelican by one second because you were halfway across the map when the timer started, another player could accidentally kill you with a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-10-best-stratagems-in-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagem</a>, or you might run out of ammo while defending the extraction point. Thankfully, one player has put together an instruction video on extraction etiquette that should make all of these pain points a thing of the past. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Reddit user pinglyadya <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d7uad4/oc_a_little_video_i_made_on_extraction_etiquette/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently posted</a> a fantastic video on extraction etiquette rules for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on the game’s subreddit. It details everything you need to know, from when to trigger extraction to the types of Stratagems you should avoid once the Pelican has been called. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">I’d like to point out the most helpful rules for good extraction etiquette in <em>Helldivers 2</em> because they’ve killed me more than once: When to call the extraction, when to enter the Pelican, and how to communicate that you’re ready to leave. </p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">First, you should always ask before calling in the extraction. I know this isn’t always possible, but there are things you can do to mitigate Helldiver losses. For example, ping the extraction point on the map to let others know you’re about to call it in. If you’re on the opposite side of the map, this is a helpful indicator to get a move on if you don’t want to be left behind. </p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">New players really do need this video to tell them when to enter the Pelican. I struggle not to shout and throw my controller every time a player enters the Pelican while I’m knee-deep in Automaton spare parts, distracting the enemy so I can be left behind by those in the relative safety of the Pelican’s hold. You should only enter when you can see others are ready, though I don’t think it matters if you go for a stylish dive. Just don’t call in an Air Strike before you do.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via pinglyadya on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">I didn’t realize this was part of extraction etiquette until watching this video, but crouching to show you’re ready to extract is a genius move. It allows every player to show when they’re good to go or if they <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-player-recreates-naked-gun-meme-with-in-game-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still need to run off and collect a few samples</a>. It’s also a much more polite way of hinting that everyone should stop blowing Terminid brains out because you need to get back to your Super Destroyer in time for afternoon tea.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">As a bonus, I also think that calling in a Resupply Stratagem after triggering the extraction is massively underrated. It is essential to have that spare ammo available for anyone running in with a horde of enemies behind them. </p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">While the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community remains fairly positive <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-backpedals-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-plans-after-3-days-of-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unless Sony tries to make them do something</a>, these extraction etiquette rules will only improve missions. Just because you’re fighting insurmountable numbers of alien scum on the most hostile planets known to humanity doesn’t mean you have to be rude. </p>

        <p>"I wish they had been more careful."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Pokeverse - a Pokémon convention partnered with the Make-a-Wish foundation and that featured the original voice of Ash Ketchum from the Pokémon TV series - has been labelled as a disaster on a scale with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-someones-made-the-glasgow-willy-wonka-experience-in-fortnite">Glasgow's infamous Willy Wonka rip-off experience</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer today, attendee BintuRina - whose social media posts describing her experience have since gone viral - said the event lacked proper planning and care for its young attendees.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the convention, held in Mandaluyong, Manila last weekend, Pokeverse had been described by organisers as "the premier Pokémon-themed expo in the Philippines made by fans for fans!" It was advertised to feature "trainer quests", "stellar headliners" and "live musical performances", alongside cosplay contests and game tournaments.

<p>
Pokeverse's main attraction was the oppurtunity to meet Veronica Taylor, Ash's voice for the first eight seasons of the franchise's anime, and Jason Paige, the singer of Pokémon's iconic original theme song. 
</p>
<p>
But even before the expo began there were concerns over its seemingly unlicensed nature, and its partnership with Dubai NFT firm Kaloscope. (Responding to concerns, Taylor has <a href="https://x.com/TheVeronicaT/status/1788614907258384513">stated</a> she was not compensated for her attendance.)
</p>
<p>
At the convention itself, the event's attractions look to have been drastically downsized based on floorplans previously posted by Pokeverse to social media. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about POKEVERSE PH<br>THE POKÉMON THEMED WONKA-DASHCON-FYRE FESTIVAL of the PHILIPPINES</p><p>Let me take you on a day by day journey through the PREMIER POKÉMON EXPO!</p><p>‼️A MEGA THREAD‼️ <a href="https://t.co/H38b4pLL6T">pic.twitter.com/H38b4pLL6T</a></p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797928992659628260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Entering the event space, attendees were reportedly greeted by a large booth from another sponsor, Frigga, which sold Chinese lucky charms. An inflatable soft play area featured a row of circus side-show style activities, completely unrelated to Pokémon.
</p>
<p>
More serious questions were raised about a Make-a-Wish panel where terminally-ill children were reportedly brought on stage for a filming oppurtunity, wearing surgical masks but in front of a large crowd. 
</p>
<p>
Another criticism was the event's filming of attendees, including minors and cosplayers changing their outfits, in a lounge area. Some of this footage was then reportedly posted online.
</p>
<p>
"Let's talk about Pokeverse, the Pokémon-themed Wonka-Dashcon-Fyre Festival of the Philippines," BintuRita wrote on social media platform X. "Let me take you on a day-by-day journey through the Premier Pokémon Expo!
</p>
<p>
"The convention center was basically barren... with standees, designs or decorations filling all the empty spaces. The place was littered with empty tables and the promised floor plans on their Facebook page were suddenly changed."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There was also an art gallery that was selling pokemon paintings but for some reason their table was like, 5 meters away from art gallery</p><p>The prices of the paintings weren't even on the paintings, they were at the table so you had to walk the stretch to even check <a href="https://t.co/VjICUToSwg">pic.twitter.com/VjICUToSwg</a></p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797935027516559734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The event's 'quests' amounted to a paper checklist asking visitors to post about certain parts of the convention on social media. And in another bizarre moment, a person covered in ravioli apparently unsettled some guests:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Eventually RAVIOLI MAN was escorted out but only after he took a sponge and started rubbing it on one of the sponsors booths.</p><p>Though later in the EXPO, security still let him back in.</p><p>I thought ticket rates were going into Crowd control and security?</p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797932706048995668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, BintuRita said she wished "the convention had more time to be planned". 
</p>
<p>
"I wish it was more Pokémon centered. I wish the production team had more emphasis on consent. And I wish they had been more careful with the children in the convention space."
</p>
<p>
Still, Rita said she had enjoyed meeting Veronica Taylor and an oppurtunity to sing with Jason Paige - despite the shambolic nature of various elements' organisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Overall, my experience does not reflect everyone's Pokeverse experience. Some people went to the con and despite the hiccups, had a wonderful time. That wasn't my experience," she concluded.
</p>
<p>
Pokeverse organisers have responded to some of the concerns raised above already, in a <a href="https://x.com/BintuRita/status/1797972103473553689">reply</a> to BintuRita's posts. 
</p>
<p>
"We apologise for the oversight, we are investigating matters with the production team," a Pokeverse spokesperson said. "It's our first event with very little time to prepare but we do agree that a lot of things need to be improved.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate your participation and will continue [to] take your feedback to do better next time."
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company itself is yet to comment on the event. Eurogamer has contacted it and Pokeverse's organisers for more.

			<p>Supergiant Games has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the second update following the early access of Hades II. It is a sizable patch that tweaks several core combat mechanics, and most of the changes came directly from community feedback.</p>
<p><em><strong>General Gameplay</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You now can encounter up to one additional Olympian each night (as in the previous game)</em></li>
<li><em>You now are likely to find one more Boon or other major reward while in Erebus</em></li>
<li><em>Increased invulnerability duration after your Death Defiance effects activate</em></li>
<li><em>Improved rewards of Ash and Psyche can now be found in [spoiler] and the [spoiler]</em></li>
<li><em>You now can press-and-hold to harvest repeatedly from Crescent Pick Outcroppings</em></li>
<li><em>Toula should now stay closer to you in Encounters, especially in the [spoiler]</em></li>
<li><em>[spoiler] no longer offers Death Defiance items if you do not need to refill the effect</em></li>
<li><em>Reduced Gold cost of Selene's Boon and Path of Stars in Charon's Shop</em></li>
<li><em>Minor adjustments to the order in which Olympians may first appear early on</em></li>
<li><em>Normalized chances of finding Fishing Points in various regions</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Nocturnal Arms &amp; Abilities</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Witch's Staff: Special knocks foes away but is slightly slower; Omega Special is faster</em></li>
<li><em>Sister Blades: Special staggers standard foes longer; Attack visual FX better match the hitbox</em></li>
<li><em>Umbral Flames: Attacks are stronger and faster; Omega Attack channels faster and uses less magick; Special gives a speed boost but has reduced damage; Omega Special can be channeled while moving</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe: reworked Special provides a lingering barrier; Omega Attack channels slightly faster; Omega Special channels faster</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull: Omega Attack channels faster and hits a larger area</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Aspects of the Nocturnal Arms</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Witch's Staff (Circe): adjusted activation and duration of Serenity effect; Serenity now adds Omega bonus damage that scales with this Aspect's rank</em></li>
<li><em>Witch's Staff (Momus): reworked; each of your Omega Moves automatically fires several times in succession from where you use them</em></li>
<li><em>Sister Blades (Artemis): you will Block again if the effect recharges while you are channeling; Block now takes priority over Dodge and similar effects</em></li>
<li><em>Umbral Flames (Eos): reworked; Omega Attack now fires a slow shot that occasionally creates damage blasts and also copies your Specials</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe (Melinoë): reworked; now adds Power and Max Life</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe (Thanatos): reworked; faster Attack adds Critical chance to Omega moves</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull (Medea): improved hit detection on foes near impassable obstacles</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull (Persephone): you now earn Glory much faster, but only by using your Omega Cast; improved control responsiveness during Omega Special</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hades II was suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on early access last month. The game has already attracted around a million players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to SteamDB</a>, despite the full release being around a year away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24170422/foundry-virtual-tabletop-interview-explainer-immersive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2nPUmb">I first got into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23851111/baldurs-gate-3-dungeons-dragons-dnd-ttrpg-spell-slots">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which naturally meant that my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23156407/tabletop-gaming-online-tools-suggestions-maps-systems">group started online</a>. This was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/21294556/dnd-how-to-play-dungeons-dragons-5e-guide-spells-dice-character-sheets-dm">particularly helpful</a> since most of my group members are spread across the world. Every few weeks, we gather on a Discord call instead of around a physical table to roll dice and tell stories. And usually, we do this via a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352511/digital-tabletop-games-coming-soon">virtual tabletop</a>, a platform that allows us to move character tokens across a map, roll virtual dice, and (maybe most importantly to some of my group members) do basic math. </p>
<p id="KuaAGV">A couple of months ago, my Dungeon Master announced that we’d be trying something a little new for our next arc. Instead of logging in to our regular virtual tabletop, he sent over a strange-looking link and told us that our passwords were simply our first names. </p>
<p id="3y9Yb5">It took a second for us to figure out how to move our character icons and scroll around the screen, but once we did, we started to explore. We quickly realized that depending on where our character icons were on the map, we as players saw different parts of the map unfold. A few characters scouted ahead, while others lingered behind on the docks. A marketplace unfolded for those looking ahead, and the rest of us immediately scrambled to follow.</p>
<p id="7X3sCX">When we eventually entered our first battle on this new platform, and rolled our first attacks, we gleefully realized that there were animations to go along with them. My eldritch blast came out in a dazzling purple, shooting right at the sentient mushroom I was trying to hit. (And then we had a quick detour where we just spammed attacks to see how they came out, because it was all <em>so</em> cool). </p>
<p id="NRTuzp">We were all dazzled by Foundry Virtual Tabletop, as we learned it was called. And our DM seemed pretty jazzed to make the game more interactive. He’s always been passionate about pulling in voice modifiers and queueing up music, but with Foundry VTT, everything leveled up <em>just</em> that much more. </p>

<p id="of5LT2">Intrigued by the new possibilities on display, I chatted with Foundry VTT creator Andrew Clayton about the up-and-coming <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23156407/tabletop-gaming-online-tools-suggestions-maps-systems">virtual tabletop system</a>, which celebrated its fourth anniversary this month. Like many tabletop players, Clayton took his games online when in-person scheduling became difficult. The virtual tabletop options out there worked decently enough, but he couldn’t help but spot some lost potential. </p>
<p id="gVp9qK">“I found them to be sort of limiting in ways that I personally found frustrating,” explains Clayton. “And so since I was in a position of being between hobbies [and] between little hobby projects at the time, I kind of had the, I guess, hubris, you might say, to sort of ask the question of, like, <em>Well, what if I try to make something?</em>” </p>
<p id="wSU4iD">He never really intended to make Foundry VTT; but after experimenting, Clayton realized that there was something of value in there and he decided to pursue it further. One of his biggest goals was to push the immersivity of the virtual experience as far as possible. The possibilities with Foundry are much much higher than other VTT spaces.</p>
<p id="k5fhCC">On the game master’s side, Foundry VTT<em> </em>is a one-time purchase for DMs that lets them download the software and host a server for an unlimited number of players, who access it via a link. There is only one purchase tier, which includes all existing Foundry VTT<em> </em>features, all future updates, and no subscription fees. And unlike other virtual tabletop experiences, Foundry VTT doesn’t require players to sign up for anything. </p>
<p id="9w8IMH">Foundry VTT has all the basics you need for a virtual tabletop: character sheets, dice rolling (which does all the math for you), maps, and tokens to move around said maps. But the software also offers a chance for DMs to get <em>really </em>immersive, with dynamic lightning, visual and audio effects, and other features that make an adventure come to life. </p>

<p id="FkBElp">It’s all pretty invisible to the players. Now that our group is all in on Foundry VTT, we mostly move around our own icons, exploring the map and uncovering new elements as we go. Battles take on an extra level of cool when attacks bring up animations targeted to the enemies we click on. The basic elements of a virtual tabletop are all there, but just augmented and given more options for immersion.</p>
<p id="D8EvKR">In one particularly climactic moment, for instance, my group watched a snow effect fall across the landscape as a queen made a big announcement. And then, as she spoke, the snow turned gold — indicating a war on the horizon. We all gasped and howled (especially since we, uh, may’ve accidentally caused the war in the first place — whoops!). All of this was done via a particle effect already integrated within<em> </em>Foundry VTT (with the help of a few mods, adds my DM).</p>
<p id="rjwVjX">Mods are a key part of the Foundry experience. Clayton decided very early on that he wanted Foundry VTT to be super developer-focused, so that members of the community could create different mods for the existing software to help integrate their favorite game systems. As a mod developer himself, this was very important to Clayton. And opening the doors for mod developers to use Foundry as a springboard ended up fostering a particularly creative and passionate community — which ended up paving the way for the company’s first big partnership with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23658946/imperium-maledictum-warhammer-40k-tabletop-rpg-cubicle-7-setting">Cubicle 7</a> for <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>’s fourth edition</a>.</p>

<p id="ex981F">“Huge IP, huge franchise, huge game system, huge publisher,” says Clayton. “By all rights that should not have been one of our first gets. [...] But part of the reason it did was the community developers who were making the Warhammer Fantasy system for Foundry had just done such a superlative job of making it an absolutely stunning visual game system that really authentically channeled the feeling of Warhammer. It was just such a strong sales pitch that got them excited and got them on board.”</p>
<p id="UXXiex">That first big win, built atop user-generated content, opened the door to other partnerships with publishers, including most recently D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast. It’s a relationship that Clayton wasn’t sure would ever happen. </p>
<p id="iX0jZJ">“I’d actually kind of reached a point where I was comfortable with the fact that it might never happen,” Clayton says. “I guess that [resignation] was what it took for [the partnership] to happen.”</p>

<p id="HVezYy">I didn’t even realize how integral the official D&amp;D integration was until I thought back on how, when I add new spells to my sheet, all I need to do is search for them and click “add.” The information from the sourcebooks my DM owns is already integrated into the server. Since my campaign is mostly homebrew, with a setting concocted by my DM, we don’t heavily use existing reference materials, but Clayton showed me how easy it is to pull up source guides for specific games, campaigns, and settings. He also demonstrated how seamless it is to jump between different written material. It’s also very useful in showing information to just one person at a time (or a handful, depending on who gets to know), which makes the experience all the more immersive.  </p>

<p id="Oo54J5">Foundry VTT<em> </em>has a bit of a learning curve to it, something that Clayton readily admits. Even on the player side, there’s a <em>lot</em> going on with the UI, which makes it a little tricky to get used to.  But Clayton likens it to Photoshop or Canva. Foundry is a tool that ultimately has more freedom and flexibility once you get past the initial hurdle of figuring it out. </p>
<p id="DAnGQk">“I’m very aware of what Foundry can do,” he says. “What surprises me and really blows me away is when a community developer actually leans into that, and really takes advantage of it and pushes the boundary of what’s possible in a really exciting way.”</p>
<p id="ards2S">For instance, Foundry VTT is primarily meant to showcase 2D maps and spaces. But there are some people out there who’ve managed to use it to convey 3D environments. There are also developers who’ve managed to put together complex scripted sequences — way more than just turning some snow a different color — that fully utilizes the software’s audio and visual capabilities. </p>

<p id="QiQPJX">“We know that that [kind of custom work] can be done,” Clayton says. “But knowing it can be done, and then seeing someone actually take the time to make it and have it work that way is really, really inspiring.” </p>
<p id="q4Q9HI">So should your weekly in-person gaming group consider making the switch online? Clayton believes that there’s some aspects of virtual tabletops that actually eclipse in-person play. Maybe there’s a big encounter on the horizon and your DM wants to try and do something special. But even scheduling games between players can be made much easier, especially at a distance, when you’re doing everything online. (“That’s top of the list [of bullet points],” Clayton quips.) </p>
<p id="TXNdgS">But there’s also just the simple fact that mechanically dense games are easier to parse when the material can be readily accessible without having to crack open a sourcebook or pull up a bunch of FAQs and databases on the web. </p>
<p id="SkB7r7">Personally, as a player, what’s really stood out to me over the last several months is just how much Foundry VTT<em> </em>embraces its digital roots, enabling GMs to virtually build out their setting and make it as dynamic as possible. The online space isn’t a limitation; it’s a jumping-off point. </p>
<p id="55dRwQ">“The ceiling [for creative people] is much, much higher,” says Clayton. “I think people probably think of some of the spectacular sets that they have on a show like <em>Critical Role</em>, where it’s this amazing terrain and [custom] miniatures for every creature. [...] The amount of work and production effort that went into that happening is totally impossible for really anyone who’s not a professional company staging that production. But I think having something that’s approaching that level of immersion in a digital environment is much much easier [using a VTT].”</p>
<p id="BQ0Srv">For what the software can do, it’s not terribly demanding on a computer. As a player, it’s all integrated within a browser, so all I have to do is click a link. Of course, it does depend on how complex the GM wants to make the experience, but Clayton absolutely wants to make sure that Foundry VTT’s capabilities balance with its performance, without sacrificing one for the other. </p>
<p id="O2hGnM">“That’s something that I want us to double down on and continue investing in,” says Clayton. “So that that remains an area where we are the superior choice for a group that wants to tell a very visually rich, very immersive, very high-production-value sort of game.” </p>

<p dir="ltr">Escort mode also received a fix that previously caused an inaccurate timer to display when a player joined a match in progress.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes include adjustments for two killstreaks. The Cluster Mine streak should now properly contribute towards a player's killstreak earn progress, and the DNA Bomb is earnable by players using scorestreaks when they reach the streak's requirement of a 25 killstreak.</p><p dir="ltr">A small Zombies update addressed an exploit that previously allowed players to bypass the mode's stash size limits, and the DNA samples for the Critical Countdown Event can now be collected in Dark Aether Rifts.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side, the popular DG-58 LSW light machine gun was drastically nerfed, with the weapon's minimum damage decreased from 27 to 22, and the maximum damage range dropped from 29.21 to 17.78 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this adjustment was made because the DG-58 LSW was "a bit too dominant at range," so a gradual damage falloff was added to keep the gun competitive at close-mid encounters, but it falls off slightly in long-range fights.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also changes the Season 4 Warzone Rewards challenge for Plunder. The challenge was previously requiring players to collect a specific amount of cash and not tracking progress, but the challenge has been changed to require players to complete 20 Plunder games instead. Hopefully, this new requirement is tracking properly.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-reveal-trailer-get-a-first-look-at-2024s-call-of-duty-game/1100-6523744/">Black Ops 6 has been officially announced</a>, and game details will arrive on June 9 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-described-as-dark-new-chapter/1100-6523660/">during the Xbox games showcase</a>.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h3>COD HQ</h3><ul><li>Prompt to restart the game after changing your Activision ID now functions as expected.</li></ul><h3>MW3 MULTIPLAYER</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>While the Looping Killstreaks modifier is active (Season 4.0), the earn progress HUD widget will now reappear after earning the highest Killstreak.</li><li>Corrected placeholder images in the Killstreaks and Equipment tabs of the Armory Unlocks menu.</li><li>Addressed an exploit allowing Custom Mods to be saved with multiple Attachments equipped to a single category.</li><li>Weekly Challenges menu now displays the correct Season 3 Camo name.</li><li>Tokyo map now displays the correct name in the Combat Record.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>Critical Countdown DNA samples will no longer appear in Private Matches.</li></ul><h3>MODES</h3><ul><li>Escort  <ul><li>Joining a match in progress will no longer display an inaccurate timer.</li></ul></li><li>Infected  <ul><li>Identity Theft Finishing Move now works as expected on Infected team members.</li><li>Inaccurate Scores are no longer displayed when a match ends with few players.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing matches to disconnect with a Connection Timed Out error.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Infected has returned to the Quick Play filter and Private Matches.</p><ul><li>One in the Chamber  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing poor performance during the Final Killcam.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp; ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>Submachine Guns</p><ul><li>Superi 46  <ul><li>Terminal V and Atoll-Z4 Suppressed Barrel Attachments now hide operator position from the minimap as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Launchers</p><ul><li>RGL-80  <ul><li>Decreased camera shake dealt to victims upon explosive damage by 60%.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>KILLSTREAKS</h3><ul><li>Cluster Mine  <ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing kills from contributing to Killstreak earn progress while the Streaks Earn Streaks modifier is active (Season 4.0).</li></ul></li><li>DNA Bomb  <ul><li>Players using Scorestreaks now earn the DNA Bomb at 25 Kills, as expected.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing Strike Team Operator customization after recruitment.</li></ul><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Sergeant's Beret companion will no longer shoot the Server during a Ground Station contract.</li><li>DNA samples for the Critical Countdown Event can now be collected in Dark Aether Rifts.</li><li>Addressed an exploit bypassing Stash size limits involving Elder Sigils.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE GENERAL</h2><ul><li><b>Warzone Rewards</b><ul><li>Under the Mode challenges, the Plunder challenge has been changed to “Complete 20 Plunder Games.”</li></ul></li></ul><h2>GAMEPLAY</h2><ul><li><b>Medical Cabinets</b><ul><li>Perk Packs can now drop from medical cabinets.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Precision Airstrikes</b><ul><li>Precision Airstrikes have been reverted back to their previous functionality prior to Season 4.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>WEAPONS</h2><h4>LIGHT MACHINE GUNS</h4><p>WEAPONADJUSTMENTS</p><h3>DG-58 LSW</h3><ul><li>Min Damage decreased to 22, down from 27.</li><li>Max Damage Range decreased to 17.78 meters, down from 29.21.</li><li><b>New Damage Ranges Added</b><ul><li>Near-Mid Damage set to 27</li><li>Near-Mid Damage Range set to 30.48 meters.</li><li>Mid Damage set to 25</li><li>Mid Damage Range set to 45.72 meters.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The DG-58 LSW was a bit too dominant at range, so we have introduced a gradual damage falloff which keeps it competitive at those close-mid encounters, but now falls off slightly as you approach those long range fights.</p><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the Bomb Drone UI to remain on the players screen.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing controller players from opening the “Manage Party” function when their squad is full.</li></ul>

        <p>Founded by Michal Napora, publisher's first releases include Tensori's Pools and Void Within's Dystopika</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Games marketing veteran Michal Napora has announced a new publishing label, Unikat.</p>
<p>Based in Perth, Unikat aims to support independent developers "who create unique and minimal games," with Tensori's liminal exploration title Pools and Voids Within's upcoming cyberpunk city builder Dystopika already on its roster.</p>
<p>Napora is the founder and CEO of marketing agency 32-33, and has worked with studios including Bloober Team, Techland, and Frogwares.</p>
<p>"For the last year, I've noticed a shift in our industry – in what players play, how they behave and buy, how players and devs want to be treated, how our industry treats them, and what games can actually be," said Napora.</p>
<p>"It feels like there is a new wave coming, a new wave of ideas, patterns, behaviours, and expectations. I feel that this change is a great thing. However, new changes cannot be supported by old industry habits."</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nixxes">Nixxes Software</a> has launched a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> PC update for Steam and the Epic Games Store. Available to download now, the new patch includes a small number of fixes and improvements.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut - Features Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzWBNwhb870?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This includes fixing issues that have arose from using certain PC hardware configurations as well as making minor changes to the game’s addictive Photo Mode.</p>


<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut arrived on PC last month, almost four years since the open world samurai sim originally launched exclusively on PS4. The Director’s Cut version includes the base game and its Iki Island expansion as well as other bonus content and the superb Legend online co-op. We decided to revisit the game on PC – via the Steam Deck – and have been impressed by the latest Nixxes port job with Valve’s handheld system being a surprisingly good fit, even if some aspects require dialling down for a smoother experience. For more on what’s included in the latest Ghost of Tsushima PC update, you can review the patch notes below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-weekly-reset-adds-new-rift-free-character-rotation.890115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/05/multiversus-weekly-reset-update-rift-fighter-rotation-june-4-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The latest <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> weekly reset is now live, allowing access to new fighters as well as a new Friday the 13th themed Rift. Similar to other free-to-play titles, MultiVersus offers a rotating cast of characters for players to use without needing to purchase them. However, to unlock these fighters permanently, you’ll need to grind out specific challenges or pay for them outright.</p>
<p><iframe title="MultiVersus - Jason vs MultiVersus Rift Cinematic" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_hxqL0-4RY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The current weekly Preview Fighter Rotation will be available until June 11, 2024, and grants access to the following MultiVersus combatants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tom &amp; Jerry</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jason</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rick</strong></li>
<li><strong>Harley Quinn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Developer Player First Games has also added a new Rift to the Warner Bros. crossover fighting title, introducing PvE bouts centred around Friday the 13th’s Jason Vorhees. Rifts were added as part of the major MultiVersus relaunch as a way to offer more content for those who aren’t solely dropping into competitive online fights.</p>
<p>According to the studio: “Rifts mode is a way for all players to jump into MultiVersus and progress their skills, outside of our competitive PVP modes. Each Rift will have a sequence of battles or challenges around a particular theme, whether it’s The Joker infiltrating the Batcave or Batman and Velma teaming up to decide who’s the best detective. These themes will be organized around seasonal “Attunements,” such as Chaos, for the Clown Prince of Crime who is joining our cast in Season 1. The same way every MultiVersus battle is bubbling with character interactions, we wanted to make each Rift “Uniquely MultiVersus,” every season. ”</p>

<p>After an open beta access period in 2022, MultiVersus seemingly vanished from the face of the planet as Warner Bros. and Player First Games returned to the lab, pulling the game from all storefronts. While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive in veering players towards buying content they’d otherwise have to grind tirelessly to unlock.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s still a long road ahead for MultiVersus and with Nintendo’s support for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate having ended, there’s hopefully room for Player First to improve and innovate within the platform fighting genre.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>It looks like The Last of Us Part 2 will be one of the next Sony games to make its way to PC.</p>
<p>According to reliable leaker Billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">Dealabs</a>, development on a PC release of Naughty Dog's sequel is complete. In fact, work on this port was allegedly tied up as of November last year.</p>
<p>Billbil-kun speculated Naughty Dog was refraining from announcing this PC port for now, in order to tie its release in with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-we-know-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">second season of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation</a>. The show's next series is currently slated to air sometime in 2025, and while it will not cover the entirety of the second game, it would likely bolster sales of any simultaneous release, making this a reasonable assumption.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog has already released its first instalment of The Last of Us on PC, packaging it up with its Left Behind DLC. Meanwhile, it released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-getting-a-playstation-5-remaster-in-january">remastered and native PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2</a> earlier this year. This Remastered release came with a few extra bells and whistles included, such as its all-new roguelike survival mode No Return and playable Lost Levels.</p>
<p>It would not be surprising to see The Last of Us Part 2 ultimately making its way to PC. Sony has been steadily releasing its once console exclusive games on Steam for several years now, and fellow PlayStation titles such as 2018's God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn have both seen their subsequent games added to the platform, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">God of War Ragnarök set to arrive in September</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps The Last of Us Part 2's PC release is one of the "multiple single-player projects" studio head Neil Druckmann spoke of earlier this week. At this time, he also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog "will not be The Last of Us studio forever"</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last month, PlayStation's Hermen Hulst shed more light on the company's strategy for bringing its games to PC. While the exec said live-service games will be released day and date on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-explains-why-its-not-bringing-tentpole-games-to-pc-at-same-time-as-ps5">the team is remaining more "strategic"</a> with when it brings its single player and narrative driven titles to an additional platform.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-port-under-development-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.890109/</guid>

<p>A new report from prominent leaker Billbil-kun <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1798305767889711131">via Dealabs</a> claims that a PC port for The Last Of Us Part 2 is already under development.</p>



<p>Loosely translated, Billbil-kun adds that the PC port has been in the works since 2021. In fact, they claim that the port was already deep into development by November 2023.</p>



<p>It’s unclear exactly why Sony would wait on this port following the remastered release. However, Billbil-kun points out that there may be some attempt to tie into the HBO live-action series. </p>



<p>There is still a lot of hype for that show after the first season earned strong ratings. Just last month, Max also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-new-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first couple of production images</a> from the upcoming season.</p>



<p>There’s been a lot of criticism over Sony’s PSN requirements. Last week, Sony officially confirmed that both God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-and-until-dawn-require-psn-account-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will require a PSN account</a> on PC. </p>



<p>However, PlayStation’s PC ports still build a lot of buzz. The Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut on PC even introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-trophies-overlay-coming-to-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation trophies and an overlay</a>. Fans would likely be pleased to revisit The Last of Us Part 2 that way. It also adds a lot of incentives for completionists.</p>



<p>This week, fans were dismayed when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Druckmann stated</a> that Naughty Dog wouldn’t be a The Last of Us studio forever.</p>



<p>At this time, Sony has not officially confirmed anything about a PC port for The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

        <p>Digital outfits in games are shaping the ways we think about what we wear, but what does this mean for fashion brands?</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><em>This series of Playable Futures articles considers how the design, technology, people, and theory of video games are informing and influencing the wider world. You can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/playable-futures">find all previous Playable Futures articles here</a>.</em></p>
<p>For decades, the conventions of fashion and style were well established. The 20-year fashion cycle would reliably roll around, bringing various styles in and out of vogue on a two-decade loop. Various youth subcultures over the years – from punk and raver to goth and skater – would be framed by a blend of fashion, music and ideology. Youngsters would join those subcultures as a way to express identity and belonging, subscribing to them loyally for years, their self-imposed dress codes bubbling up to the catwalk, as high fashion simultaneously trickled down to the pavement from luxury brands. In the space between those two opposites, high street fashion and streetwear exist and persist, taking their cues from both subcultures and fashion houses.</p>
<p>In the late 20th century, the postmodern mindset would start to trouble those conventions a little, introducing concepts such as irony, pluralism and self-referentiality. Suddenly, things weren't quite so clear cut. Sociologists of style would argue that at the turn of the millennium, we began to be freed from the meanings certain clothing carried.</p>
<p>But postmodernism was just the start of a grand change. In the years that followed, video games established themselves as a true cultural phenomenon, and offered the worlds of fashion an abundance of opportunity, challenge, and change.</p>
<blockquote><p>"People from the world of fashion will increasingly be thinking of games as something like venues, or maybe destinations"</p></blockquote>
<p>For one, 'gamer' as a subculture of its own emerged, offering a broad, vibrant style palette informed by the things we play. Soon after, the fascinating phenomenon of the 'skinification of fashion' would radically shift the very notion of subcultures, meaning, and 20-year cycles. More on that below.</p>
<p>The largest shift, meanwhile, might be that of the opportunity for fashion brands to exist as part of the games people play, connecting with vast audiences while establishing years-long relationships with consumers.</p>
<p>That is something Tom Parry has seen happen across the world of fashion. His varied career kicked off in the media planning world in 2008, before eventually leading him to a contract role at Ralph Lauren, working as gaming strategy and project lead in the company's global digital marketing department. Parry would then move to serving as head of UMI Games, a specialist studio focused on connecting brands with the gaming audience through firstly Fortnite, Roblox, and soon Minecraft.</p>
<p>And for Parry, games are the natural place for fashion brands to congregate, both now and in the future.</p>
<p>"To a significant degree, as a fashion brand you have to go to where consumer attention is; you need presence in those places," offers Parry. "I think the attention of a lot of people has been towards social media over maybe the past 15 years, but increasingly consumer attention is turning to gaming. And thanks to gaming's maturity now, there's a huge built out ecosystem from content creators to players to streaming audiences to certain games emerging as platforms of their own, meaning the likes of Fortnite and Roblox.</p>
<p>"You've also got the industry's technology ecosystem, which is letting the people at the reins of these games serve and maintain these live spaces that games have increasingly become, while letting both players and creators share and host their own content."</p>
<p>Considering games' vast, demographically diverse, always-on and deeply engaged audience, fashion brands simply can't ignore games. And now – relatively, at least – making branded content for the likes of Fortnite is a straightforward process. Equally, placing a fashion brand in a game has been majorly derisked by the emergence of live services. Gone are the days of brand holders having to lay down high sums on content that makes up part of a boxed release, reaching audiences many months after the moment of a campaign's inception.</p>
<blockquote><p>"You can do something with fashion brands in games that you can't do in other ways"</p></blockquote>
<p>"I think people from the world of fashion will increasingly be thinking of games as something like venues, or maybe destinations," Parry continues. "They are places players visit and spend time. That's especially true of Roblox, while Fortnite has a bit more of a community-building element to consider. Younger demographics are hanging out in those games now – not necessarily playing – where maybe in the 1990s they spent that time at the skatepark, not necessarily skating. But these games as places are a chance to meet people from across the world, and discover culture and mix yourself up in it. And fashion has always been in part about that."</p>
<p>In other words, games are increasingly places fashion brands have to be, and where they can meet many different types of potential customer. And, curiously, it looks like we are set to see ever more high-end brands have a presence in games more commonly associated with younger players who sport shallower pockets.</p>
<p>"It's about a longer-term strategy than going to your immediate and existing audiences, and that's only going to become more true in the future," states Parry. "Brands are seeing that they need to start building that relationship with that consumer on what ultimately is a very low financial lift, perhaps long before that consumer might spend on the brand, versus the existing model of reaching them later in life. And there's increasingly older players in these games too, and it appears we'll only see these larger games offer ever more diverse audience. I think it's a bit of a scattergun approach for fashion brands. You can reach hundreds of millions of players globally in a very different, new way, in a very immersive way, really immersing the player in that brand and telling a very rich brand story. I think that is key.</p>
<p>"You can do something with fashion brands in games that you can't do in other ways. So it's ultimately about building that brand loyalty; building brand awareness. We had it working on the Ralph Lauren campaign. We found that lots of these players didn't know what or who Ralph Lauren was. It was a big shock internally. Everyone must know who Ralph Lauren is, right? But that wasn't the case. So even these huge, iconic brands need to keep fighting for presence and attention; maybe moreso in such a crowded brand landscape. And with that effort, within Ralph Lauren we also saw how games could engage people who would be loyal customers a few years later. This approach and mindset is going to become hugely important to fashion in the future."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The way players interact with skins in games like Fortnite is presenting new opportunities for fashion brands</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Parry also sees – and believes we will increasingly see – fashion brands of every size start to become more involved, with a broader sweet of games becoming embraced.</p>
<p>"For now there's a lot of focus by the bigger fashion brands on Roblox and Fortnite, and we're seeing increasing interest in EA FC and reaching older players through Call of Duty and so on. But as these bigger brands set the example of what's possible, I think that absolutely, we'll see fashion brands of every size start to work with quite a spectrum of games of all sizes.</p>
<p>"And we're seeing new platforms such as Discord born from gaming, and now they're beginning to branch out and to grow as more audiences come into this space. Discord and other equivalent platforms offer another opportunity for presence where audiences are. So gaming is creating all these brand opportunities that go beyond directly placing your content in a high profile game, and I think right now we're just seeing the beginning of how important games become to fashion – and arguably vice versa."</p>
<p>All of this presents a tremendous opportunity for games; especially as a movement that permeates the medium beyond the live service giants – and particularly at a time when the likes of in-game cosmetic items offer new generations means to explore and assert identity. Which brings us back to the 'skinification of fashion.'</p>
<p>The theory – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CplXeGpLK7K/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">proposed perfectly here in digest form by trend forecaster and internet culture expert Agustina Panzoni</a> – suggests that the approach to dressing characters in games is starting to profoundly shape style choices in reality. It's part of a cultural movement called hyperrealism, which itself is in part informed by the prowess of game engines like Unreal to play with the space that exists between realism and representation (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoiWTnDsqt_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">again, Panzoni sums it up best</a>).</p>
<p>The skinification theory proposes that video games have set a new standard, where we are free to hop between something like skins out here in the real world, rather than having to subscribe to a singular subculture or personal style for multiple years. That, it is suggested, explains the boom in fleeting fashion 'aesthetic trends' such as '<a href="https://www.russh.com/kidcore-trend-aesthetic/">kidcore</a>', '<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Clowncore">clowncore</a>' and '<a href="https://coveteur.com/blokette-trend">blokequette/blokette</a>', each of which is giddily free of the cultural and ideological commitments once demanded by traditional subcultures. Now one can hop between these fashion trends day-by-day, or even hour-by-hour, swapping them like skins – embracing a movement that could potential diminish the 20-year cycle to a matter of moments.</p>
<p>"It's a fascinating concept, absolutely, even if it's not yet influencing the mainstream of fashion," concludes Parry. "But it seems to be at play in the evolution of fast fashion. There's every chance we're going to see games and their content directly influence all kinds of elements of fashion in the future, from the brands that succeed to the ways people think about how their clothes reflect who they are.</p>
<p>"It's a really exciting time to be in the space, and if you're in games, you already are."</p>

What interested you about making a game about running your own pizza shop?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yuni Cho, community marketing manager</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Our CEO, Anthony Lai, grew up in Queens, NY, where people from all cultures and walks of life would eat and enjoy pizza as a universal food. One of his fondest childhood memories was going to a by-the-slice pizza shop and visiting the arcade store in his neighborhood, which later became an inspiration for the general “hole in the wall” neighborhood pizzeria mood of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were inspired to make a game with the same global and diverse reach through the eyes of pizza-making. After iterations </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>My Pizza Shop</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>My Pizza Shop 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was finally born. Its unique structure combines a story-driven casual game, a technical business simulator, and a creative pizza-making mechanic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing gameplay around the actual crafting of the pizzas? What appealed to you about creating such a hands-on play style for making the food? What do you feel this hands-on play adds to the experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthony Lai, CEO and founder of Tapblaze</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The initial team were big fans of pizza to begin with. The original artist even worked at Costco Pizza, and we were looking for an artist with a unique style that would appeal to a universal crowd. With the belief in pizza’s global reach and insight into how pizzas were made, we created the design for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is beauty in the art of pizza-making. The dough acts as a canvas for whoever makes it. It’s an empty space where anyone can paint a picture, add their own flair, and express themselves while making an equally delicious pizza. The hands-on play allows players to personalize their experience and satisfyingly adds to the game’s realism. It’s important that a game gives players an opportunity to express themselves, and for us, that was pizza.</span></p><p>Images via TapBlaze.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The food looks pretty tasty as you play through </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. What visual design ideas go into making food that looks good? What thoughts go into creating a game that will make players hungry?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The visual idea was to make players crave the pizza they were making in the game. The unique art style combined with the overall warmer tone of the game enhances the pizzas’ appetizing look. Each topping also goes through multiple concepts internally before they are put into the game. It is the “beauty in the details” that we believe makes the pizza in the game look so delicious.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cho</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Our focus is to keep the realism. Many of the pizza orders you see in the game are based on real pizza orders/menus like Supreme, Veggie, or Meat Lovers. We wanted to draw from the familiarity and nostalgia associated with eating pizza.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through the game reviews from actual pizza shop employees, we seemed to have really nailed the realism of the customers in particular. Many would write us an app review on how much of a hoot they got out of some outrageous but very realistic customer requests, like no cheese or sauce on a pizza order.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game’s Steam page mentions that the designer worked in a pizza shop for years and has brought that experience to the game. Can you tell us a bit about how that actual experience shaped the game? Any stories from your working years that made for interesting elements or storylines within the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The original artist worked at Costco Pizza and dreamed of becoming a game artist. But due to his lack of experience, no one had given him a chance. As a new game startup, TapBlaze saw the artist’s potential and considered his pizza-making experience as a bonus for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His real-life experiences ultimately shaped the general feeling of the game. From the art style, color tones, and characters, the game is reminiscent of an “indie” game. Characters, like the fan-favorite hobo customer, often have a backstory where they become someone from nothing, just like our studio and the original game artist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cho</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We try our best to incorporate slightly modified versions of what we see in our daily lives. The diversity of the game’s characters is reminiscent of the customers our CEO saw when he used to hang out at pizza shops growing up. We also take inspiration from the people we encounter in our day-to-day lives; the mailman in the game is also the mailman who used to come to our office.</span></p><p>Images via TapBlaze.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the cooking equipment players would use within the game and how they would be able to upgrade it? How did this equipment further capture a realistic pizza shop experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The cooking equipment came from looking up what real-life pizzerias use to cook their pizzas. The pizza oven is based on the ones used in Costco and other pizza chains. The “autobuddy” upgrades available in the game came directly from the idea that Costco saves a lot of money using their auto saucer machine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It aims to capture a realistic pizza shop experience since everything you see will be exactly like a mom-and-pop pizzeria. The topping bins, pizza peel, pizza boxes, and shop decor should remind players of their local pizza shop. The only difference is the auto buddies that add a game-like mechanic to magically place your toppings in the perfect spots quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You state that there are over one million unique pizza orders possible in the game. What work went into creating so many different orders? How did you accomplish this?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keyan Zhang, game designer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: There are thousands of order strings broken up into four different parts. Essentially, these strings are randomized per pizza order to create an entirely new order from the last order the player came across. It is separated into toppings (with over 20 different ones to choose from), sauces, slice amounts, and additional customizations like double-baked pizza.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you mix these components together to generate an order, more than a million types of orders could be generated.</span></p><p>Images via TapBlaze.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players can heavily customize their shops in a variety of ways. Why was this important to the experience to you? What thoughts go into designing neat things players can use to decorate their shops?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cho</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The customizable shop was and still is a very important aspect of the game’s charm. It is the #1 place where players can show off their style and personality, truly making the pizza shop their own. This is evident in the game’s reviews and communities, where players often share their excitement over their decorated shops with many “Rate My Shop” posts. It’s another form of creative expression for players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The artists are given a theme and different places the decors could go. After that, it’s up to them to create the magic. For example, Halloween 2021’s theme was “goth.” The artists designed a gorgeous table set, blood-red chandeliers, a molded oven, and burgundy “goth” decorations that fit the theme of a vampire’s castle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You continue to update the game with seasonal events and new content. What thoughts go into adding something fun to pizza-making around specific holidays and seasons? Can you tell us a bit about designing more toppings and items for a specific event you’re particularly proud of?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: First and foremost, we ask: “How can we make this pizza-style?” Whether it’s for Mother’s Day, summer, Halloween, or Christmas, the point is to make everything in the style of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mary Le, narrative designer at Tapblaze</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The most recent topping additions were inspired by how different cultures interpret pizza; some have figs, some have avocados, and others may have duck. We try to widen our players’ perspectives and educate them about the pizzas people eat around the globe. A great way to do that is through new, exciting, and sometimes outlandish ingredients.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zhang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We are particularly proud of the 2021 summer event, during which we introduced the avocado topping and gardening feature to the game for the first time. It was a great success as players were able to grow their own pizza ingredients, showcasing a true “farm-to-table” moment. Players loved it so much that we later added it as a permanent feature to the core game in chapters four and five.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PC port of The Last of Us Part II was reportedly completed a few months ago, and it is not yet known why the game has not been released.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known reliable insider billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">commented</a> on the PC version of the second entry in the series by Naughty Dog released earlier this year on PlayStation 5, saying that the PC port of the game has been in development since 2021, and it was completed by November 2023. As for why the game still hasn't been released, the insider could not say but speculates the release could have been held back to coincide with the launch of the second season of the HBO show, which is scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>The PC version of The Last of Us Part II will be based on the Remastered release launched earlier this year on PlayStation 5. With the additions of the No Return Mode, the Lost Levels, and the developer's commentary, it is the best way to enjoy the game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II is now available on PlayStation 4, while the Remastered release is only available on PlayStation 5. The game will be released at some point on PC.</p>

Perhaps The Last of Us 2 will launch on PC in March 2025.</p><p>Before then, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-release-officially-confirmed-state-of-play-2024">Sony Santa Monica’s God of War: Ragnarok</a> launches on PC on September 19, 2024. Live service PlayStation games, however, launch on PlayStation 5 and PC at the same time. Arrowhead’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> did exactly that earlier this year and went on to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. The upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, another live service shooter, is also set to launch on PS5 and PC on the same day later this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s worth noting that all PlayStation games on PC, even single-player only games, now require a PlayStation Network account to work, much to the annoyance of some Steam users. God of War: Ragnarok launches on PC with the new PlayStation overlay featuring shared trophies and more that was introduced with the PC version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p><p>Sony revealed PS5’s upcoming slate during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced">a May edition of State of Play</a>. PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-is-a-new-beginning-and-the-biggest-game-weve-ever-made-team-asobi-says">Astro Bot</a> stole the show, but there was also room for the aforementioned Concord, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The Final Shape wraps up Destiny’s long-running narrative by taking players inside the Traveler for a showdown with the enigmatic Witness. This marks the climax of a decade of intricate Destiny storytelling, leaving fans curious about the future.  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches">Some are even speculating Bungie has Destiny 3 up its sleeve</a>.</p><p>For now, if you're looking to jump into the expansion and see what it has to offer, we have found the best deal available for those on PC. Destiny 2: The Final Shape is down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdwgX" target="_blank">$42.99 at Fanatical</a> (<a href="https://zdcs.link/V08K3" target="_blank">£35,69 in the UK</a>) a trusted steam code seller, and a 15% saving compared to the $49.99 list price. It's not an enormous saving, but it's well worth considering if you were already planning to buy the expansion.</p><div><div id="201683"><p><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape (PC)</h3></p><div><p>Now Available - Steam Code</p></div></div><div id="201684"><p><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape + Annual Pass (PC)</h3></p><div><p>Now Available - Steam Code</p></div></div></div><p>Bungie developers have hinted that The Final Shape is not the conclusion of Destiny 2 or the series as a whole. The developer, now owned by Sony, is also working on the multiplayer game Marathon. In a series of tweets celebrating the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director Luke Smith discussed the journey to its release and the tremendous effort the developers invested. However, it was his repeated use of the capitalized word "Hope" that sparked a buzz within the Destiny community.</p><p>For now, the focus is on The Final Shape and its three planned episodes. Echoes kicks off next week on June 11, Revenant is set for October 2024, and Heresy rounds The Final Shape off in February 2025, although of course, the plan may change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Final Shape launched on June 4, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-developer-bungie-truly-sorry-for-the-final-shape-launch-issues">Destiny 2 quickly encountered major server issues</a> that hindered players from progressing through the highly anticipated campaign. Many players reported being kicked out of campaign levels, missing crucial cutscenes, and losing progress. Bungie provided progress updates via Twitter as they worked to resolve the issues, but for many players, the night was a loss.</p><p>Bungie has rolled out a number of restarts in a bid to tackle errors causing players to get kicked out of activities, which it said “remains our highest priority issue to resolve.” Those who missed a cutscene can replay the mission by accessing the Replayable Missions node in the middle of the Pale Heart map, Bungie advised. There are cutscenes at the end of Mission 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>“We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy,” Bungie continued. “We’re truly sorry if connection issues and instability is getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We've also been raving around a similar DLC discount for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deal-elden-ring-dlc-before-release-day-pc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, which is down to $35.19</a>, also from Fanatical.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-players-discover-special-homelander-brutality-with-a-cool-the-boys-easter-egg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> now has Homelander as a DLC character, and players are already finding cool Easter eggs with the supervillain.</p><p>Homelander, from the phenomenally popular Prime Video show <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-boys">The Boys</a>, launches in NetherRealm's gory fighting game with a number of references, but one Brutality in particular was found to include unique dialogue that hat tips an infamous scene.</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Boys Season 2 follow:</em></p><p>In The Boys Season 2 premiere The Big Ride, Homelander is introduced to Blindspot, a candidate for replacing the now-deceased Translucent's spot in The Seven. Blindspot is blind but possesses superhuman hearing and agility. Homelander, clearly unimpressed, bashes Blindspot’s ears in, declaring him “just another useless f***ing blind guy.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mortal-kombat-1/How_to_Do_Brutalities">All Mortal Kombat 1 characters have Brutalities</a> — unique moves that end a match in a particularly brutal fashion. They’re triggered by doing an extra input command on top of a specific combo ender or move that wins the final round. Most of the characters in the game have six brutalities, but ever since Mortal Kombat 1 launched in September last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-players-are-starting-to-discover-hidden-brutalities-including-one-for-omni-man"><u>players have discovered secret Brutalities, too</u></a>.</p><p>Homelander’s Brutality is similar to the ear bash he performs on Blindspot in the show, leaving his opponent screaming in agony on the floor. But, if Homelander performs this Brutality on Kenshi, he says the line from the show: “just another useless f***ing blind guy.” Kenshi, Mortal Kombat fans will know, is a blind swordsman who uses telekinetic abilities to defeat his opponents — and perfect fodder for Homelander’s quip.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander has a unique line when performing a brutality on Kenshi. <a href="https://t.co/OQOgXxk32m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OQOgXxk32m</a></p>— Noah Hajnasr (@DIZZ_NH) <a href="https://twitter.com/DIZZ_NH/status/1798077214266974692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It's a cool nod to The Boys, but not everything about Mortal Kombat 1's Homelander is a perfect recreation of the on-screen character. For example, Warner Bros. has remained coy about the voice actor behind Mortal Kombat 1’s Homelander. Antony Starr, who plays Homelander in The Boys, does not voice the character, much to the disappointment of fans. Omni-Man voice actor J. K. Simmons reprised his role for Mortal Kombat 1, as did Peacemaker actor John Cena. It is unclear why Starr did not do the same here.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now), and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (available now), Homelander (available now), and the upcoming Takeda Takahashi, as well as five DLC Kameo fighters. The Boys Season 4, meanwhile, kicks off June 13.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
