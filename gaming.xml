			<p>The Thaumaturge is an RPG where you collect monsters and use them to fight. This might sound like a certain other game, but this is set in Warsaw in 1906, the monsters are all horrific demons, and it heavily features the real-life fascinating weirdo Rasputin. So, there are a few differences, not to mention the bleak, melancholic tone and the fact that some of the people here are worse than the monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thaumaturge | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL57ftcwSSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re curious, a Thaumaturge is someone who can sense emotions and intentions that have been imprinted onto items using the help of salutors – those demonic monsters. As you can imagine, this makes them an investigative force to be reckoned with, as all you have to do is touch a couple of things and everything you could possibly need to know presents itself. This is convenient, as it turns out Warsaw happens to be full of unrest, so there’s an awful lot of mysteries to be solved as desperation, greed, and betrayal are everywhere.</p>


<p>Enter Wictor Szulski who, at the beginning of the game, is looking for the famous faith healer Grigori Rasputin to help him regain control over his Thaumaturgy powers. Naturally, he is successful just in time for Wictor to have a dream about his father’s death and return to Warsaw. Rasputin, ever the mysterious weirdo, tags along and you find yourself in Warsaw in the early stages of a revolution.</p>
<p>The story and setting here is the highlight of the game. Rasputin in particular is a confounding presence, exactly what he wants is a complete mystery until late in the game and it’s the thing that I kept thinking about whilst I wasn’t playing. He’s portrayed well too, featuring all the weird cult-like behaviour you’d expect from a charismatic faith healer, whilst he himself is adamant he’s just helping people. He’d fit well into the right-wing manosphere these days. Outside of Rasputin, every character here has their own motives and feelings just waiting for you to find them imprinted onto a discarded onion or something, which is great – the writing can’t really be faulted, but sometimes its delivery falls a little flat.</p>


<p>There’s a bit at the end of the prologue that was a bit unclear and I had to go back over it in my head to piece it together, though perhaps I missed something. At one point I was also kidnapped, tied up, and interrogated by someone who turned out to be a childhood friend and the fact that Wictor just casually assisted this kidnapper in a fight afterwards and continued to associate with him is just flat out crazy.</p>
<p>The bigger issue with all the investigating is that, as you’re a Thaumaturge, you press R2 and Wictor clicks his fingers, giving you a trail to follow to the selected objective. You can’t fast travel within areas either, so you spend an awful lot of time running around following a trail of particles, pressing R2 again every few seconds because the trail constantly disappears for no good reason. It soon starts to feel less like investigating and more like fetch quests, but you’re fetching people’s secrets. I forgave this issue pretty quickly though due to the strength of the setting and writing though, especially once I started collecting salutors in the city.</p>
<p>Salutors latch onto people with flaws – Wictor’s flaw is Pride, for example, it drew his main salutor, the Upyr, to him when he was young. Thaumaturges can tame and use salutors, but for everyone else a salutor influences the environment around the person with the flaw. When Wictor finds one, he must discover who has the flaw so he can bring it out into the open, which allows him to fight and then capture the salutor. Wictor normally wouldn’t be able to manage this, but with the help of Rasputin he can master multiple salutors. From the Upyr, through Djinns and all the way to Golems, the designs for the many salutors are excellent, if not entirely unique.</p>

<p>They’re not just for investigating either, there’s a combat system in this game that is quite unique. Each round, Wictor and a salutor have an action, and you can switch between any salutors you’ve unlocked at will. Actions take a certain amount of time – a short action takes one round, whilst a long one takes two rounds. The same is true of each enemy and you can see what order they’ll be attacking and what they’ll be doing at the top of the screen. Your attacks have a variety of effects in addition to dealing damage, such as lowering an enemy’s focus, causing bleeding damage each round, and so on. Some attacks can slow down or even cancel an enemy’s planned attack if you’re lucky. If you remove all of an enemy’s focus, they’ll cancel their planned attack and be open to an extra powerful yet very quick attack as well.</p>
<p>On top of this, each of the salutors have their own attacks that vary wildly. The weird chicken one, the Lelek, is excellent at removing enemy focus whilst giving you some bonuses, but doesn’t really deal much damage to health, whilst the Djinn is rather powerful but its attacks have a cost as well. It’s a system that’s deep and unique enough that it takes a while for it to click, but once it does it’s very enjoyable and very adaptable, especially with the ridiculous amount of salutors you end up with.</p>
<p>It’s a little unbalanced though. If you do side stuff you’ll either find the story quests to be too easy when you return to them or sometimes bump into a side quest that’s a bit too hard for you. It’s also weirdly underutilised, to the point where you can go a few hours without a fight and then the game will come up with an absurd reason to make one happen, one so transparently an excuse that it isn’t even mentioned after the fight. Not a big problem, but a little immersion breaking.</p>

<p>Crucially for a game with a lot of talking, the voice acting is mostly good, with only a few slightly off-kilter moments. The music is fantastic too, hosts of melancholic violins and the combat music is still stuck in my head. It’s a pretty good looking game as well, though character’s face movements and expressions look a little too muppet-y sometimes, but the environments are detailed and the game runs well throughout.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-right-when-the-new-year-starts-%E2%80%93-rumor.1063218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed right when the new year starts, judging from some reported behind-the-scenes chatter.</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/reflecting-on-the-game-awards-2024-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry Microcast</a>, Chris Dring reported that he has heard some chatter from other people suggesting that the console could be revealed right when the new year starts. As this is chatter, however, Chris Dring stressed that it shouldn't be taken as fact.</p>
<p>Shortly after Chris Dring's statement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing became public, Nintendtalk revealed that insiders at major third-party developers suggest that a January reveal for the console is definitely in the cards. Samus Hunter added that the system's official announcement may have been brought forward to early January, before the release of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on January 16th, due to the recent leaks from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">accessories manufacturers</a>. As all these sources have questionable reliability, however, we have to take all they've said with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Source: Nintendo to reveal Nintendo Switch 2 in January. This is coming from a Major Third Party developer contact I have. Here’s what they say about the console:</p>
<p>“Get ready to play modern AAA offerings on your Nintendo system in 2025”</p>
<p>— NintenTalk (@NintenTalk) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenTalk/status/1868715333881938264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am not sure how much longer I can contain my hype for Nintendo Switch 2 based on literally everything I am hearing that I can't say here or in videos. Good news is, it sounds like I won't be waiting much longer...</p>
<p>— Nintendo Prime (@NintyPrime) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintyPrime/status/1868723760955900325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo may advance the next-generation Switch reveal with an announcement that possibly could come before DK. This is to address recent leaks especially of accessories to ensure official news for the public. The remaining announcements of Switch games may come a little later.</p>
<p>— Samus Hunter | Nintendo Leak and News Inside (@SamusHunter2) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamusHunter2/status/1868898948825727415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Where there's smoke, there's fire, as they say, so it seems very likely that a Nintendo Switch 2 reveal may not be too far off into the future. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>Quick, the world is in peril, your adopted daughter is under threat, and nearby villagers are being terrorised by monsters. What do you do? Oh, you're sitting down at a cosy table in the local tavern. You're playing a card game with a dude called "Aldert". The wind outside is howling, and so are the nightwraiths, but you're just sitting there. Playing another "cow" card. Okay.</p>
<p>Guess you'll be happy to learn that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">Witcher 4</a> developers have more or less confirmed that Gwent will be making a return in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">recently trailered</a> Ciri-led sequel. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/cd-projekt-knows-why-were-all-really-here-gwent-is-coming-back-in-the-witcher-4-and-the-devs-dont-think-anyone-will-be-disappointed/">PC Gamer</a>, two developers at CD Projekt Red responded to a recent interview question about the in-universe card game with some confidence, saying: "I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"We really love the game," said executive producer Gosia Mitręga in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmbhFPninuw?feature=shared&amp;t=637">interview with Easy Allies</a>. "And we also really carefully always listen to the community, which we love... But I don't think anyone will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"Yeah for sure," added game director Sebastian Kalemba. "It's a part of the experience, so absolutely. We also love Gwent."</p>
<p>It was perhaps a no-brainer that the card game be revived for the sequel, considering it was popular enough to spawn a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game">free-to-play multiplayer spin-off</a> and a standalone singleplayer adventure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thronebreaker-the-witcher-tales">Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales</a>. Both of which, as card games, were pretty solid. </p><p>Gwent as it originally appeared in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> was inspired by physical card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/112/condottiere">Condottiere</a>, with a few differences in both visuals and rules to make it fit into the world of the cat-eyed freelancers and sneaky bog witches. The multiplayer version, meanwhile, has mutated from its original design throughout the years, to the extent that any time I've booted it up I find have no idea how best to use my cards anymore. I'm interested to see exactly what form it'll take in the Witcher 4, and if my wintry tactic of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-annoying-thing-i-like-to-do-in-gwent">covering the board in frost</a> will once again be viable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-cut-back-on-%E2%80%98toilet-humor%E2%80%99-says-gearbox.1063209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gearbox’s Narrative Director says it will reduce toilet humor for its next installment in the Borderlands series, Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>The revelation came from the X account (formerly Twitter) of Gearbox Narrative Director Sam Wrinkler, who previously worked on both Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Borderlands 3. In response to a question about the narrative direction pertaining to jokes, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Winkler said</a>, “Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3’s overabundance of toilet humor.”</p>



<p>He later elaborated, “I’m not gonna say there’s no toilets, but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch, I’m gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder.”</p>



<p>The Borderlands series has always tried to have a boatload of humor, and Winkler’s comments might be a positive sign for those who didn’t enjoy the humor in Borderlands 3, which was criticized for having fairly lousy humor. A simple search on Google (it’s still a thing, ya know?) of Borderlands 3 humor pulls up loads of search results of people criticizing the game and its cringe-like humor.</p>



<p>So, for now at least, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll have to wait until 2025</a> to know how many toilet jokes are in the game.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is set to launch in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of Winker’s comments on the humor in Borderlands 4? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Yet with a base roster of 33 characters, some were inevitably going to rise to the top of the heap once players got their hands on them. Memes and humorous videos about the game have already taken social media by storm, with many focusing on which characters are causing tons of frustration and annoyance for the game’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">ten million plus playerbase</a>. After playing a few hundred matches of my own, I’ve found certain ones are far more dreaded than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So today, we’re going to rank the top Marvel Rivals characters by how much they’re driving fans crazy. Obviously this list could change in the future depending on new additions or balance patches, but for now, here are the most overpowered characters in Marvel Rivals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Moon Knight</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-moon-knight-1734382313453.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Marc Spector, aka Moon Knight, may be a relatively low level character powerwise in the pantheon of Marvel comics, but he’s a serious threat in Rivals. Both his Crescent Darts and Moon Blades can bounce not just between enemies who are close together, but also between his Ankhs, which crafty players can place at all sorts of weird angles to get bonus damage without their foes even knowing where they’re being hit from. This is even easier for Moon Knight players because of how agile he is, easily scaling buildings or vantage points with his double jump and hookshot skills. And while his ultimate, Hand of Khonshu, is easily dodgeable if spotted, the fact that it comes from directly above means many Moon Knights have discovered it’s best to place it slightly behind the enemy team. This takes advantage of the natural inclination for players to back up when they can’t instantly see where an ultimate attack is coming from, leading them straight into the damage zone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He does require forethought and positioning, but once you grasp the fundamentals, Moon Knight can devastate an enemy team before he’s even spotted.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Star-Lord</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-star-lord-1734382335778.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The title of “Legendary Star-Lord” may be something Peter Quill calls himself more than anyone else does, but in Rivals he more than lives up to the hype. Playing like a variant of Overwatch’s Tracer with the ability to fly instead of zip back in time, Star-Lord is a lightning-fast triggerman. His Element Guns deal high damage at a rapid rate, he can fly out of a hot zone at a moment’s notice, and his Stellar Shift dodge ability, for which he has two charges before cooldown, not only reload his guns but also grant him invincibility frames. When it comes to hit and run tactics, few Rivals characters can match Star-Lord, which makes his ultimate even more outrageous. Galactic Legend couples his hard hitting and quick reloading weapons with free flight and auto-aim, meaning that unless someone snipes him the second he activates it, there’s little the enemy team can do but scramble for cover and wait the ability out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He still needs to be careful health-wise due to being a squishy DPS character, so he can be something of a glass cannon. But if you’re quick and good at managing cooldowns, Star-Lord can feel unbeatable in the right hands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Scarlet Witch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-scarlet-witch-1734382357921.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no way the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-powerful-marvel-characters">strongest Avenger</a> was going to sit out a Marvel hero shooter, and Wanda Maximoff makes another return to the spotlight as one of Rivals’ most deadly duelists. Perfect for Moira players from Overwatch who couldn’t help but get the most eliminations in a match while ostensibly being a healer (guilty as charged), Scarlet Witch can drain enemy health bars without needing to aim much. Joining her lock-on magic are powerful Chthonian Burst missiles which she can toss frequently, and two charges of Mystic Projection, which gives her free flight and a ‘Phased’ state that allows her to avoid all damage for a short time. Once you get into a rhythm, Wanda can annihilate foes at both close and long range while easily ducking out of retaliation or enemy ultimates without even needing to be well-positioned. And then there’s her ultimate, Reality Erasure, and while it does have a long charge time, it instantly vaporizes any enemy within range. It’s more than worth the wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Scarlet Witch main myself, plenty of players probably hate me. But if loving Wanda in this game is wrong, I don’t want to be right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Hela</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-hela-1734382389004.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This one might not be as obvious to casual players, but real Rivals heads are sure to know why Hela makes this list. The Goddess of Death lives up to her namesake, with her Nightsword Thorn primary fire able to wipe out heroes at a far distance with only a couple of critical strikes, and her Piercing Night attack often killing them outright with a single cast. Although she’s not technically a sniper, she can basically function as one in the hands of a skilled enough player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget her ultimate, Goddess of Death, which allows Hela to soar above the field and rain hellfire from above. Although it is technically possible to drain her health bar in this state, it’s not really worth it because she gets a HP boost, meaning it takes pretty much the entire duration of the ability’s cast time to shoot her down. This means she can clear a point single-handedly by forcing the enemy team to flee for cover, making her an early favorite for character bans once you reach Diamond rank in Competitive Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor and Loki may be more popular characters, but Hela is the true Asgardian threat you need to watch out for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Jeff</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-jeff-1734382415946.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No one would have thought that an adorable baby shark could cause so much hysteria, but Jeff the Land Shark has quickly become one of the most hated heroes in Marvel Rivals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? He’s a healer, and he’s not exactly built for the front lines (even if his primary attack is deceptively powerful and he has a damage reduction against critical hits.) But the real reason Jeff is so feared is his ultimate ability, It’s Jeff!, where the little land shark reveals his monstrous appetite. Jeff is invincible while casting and, after selecting a circular area, he instantly swallows everyone within it, friend and foe alike. Enemies do take damage when they’re in Jeff’s stomach, but the real value of this ability is that he can move with other players inside him, meaning Jeffs will often spit their foes into bottomless pits. Some will even guarantee the kills by committing suicide, leaping over the edge with enemies inside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is counterplay to this ability (Scarlet Witch can usually escape being swallowed with a well-timed Mystic Projection, for example), but the indignity of being eaten and thrown off a cliff by a baby shark has enraged many a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He may be intended for keeping his allies healthy, but smart use of his ultimate makes Jeff an absolute menace on the battlefield.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Iron Fist</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/marvel-rivals-op-iron-fist-1734382439419.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No character inspires more primal terror in the hearts of Marvel Rivals players than Lin Lie, the Immortal Iron Fist. This master martial artist has far and away the most insane powers in the game. Not only do his rapid fire punches allow him to assassinate healers and duelists with impunity while giving him bonus health in the process, but he also has four air jumps before cooldown, as well as a spin kick that dashes him forward. This means that he can effectively fly with well-timed use of his attacks and jumps, chasing characters like Iron Man <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAlerts/status/1866010702080627027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literally through the sky</a>. But that’s not even the worst of it. He can also use Dragon’s Defense as a parry maneuver against virtually any attack in the game. <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAlerts/status/1866010702080627027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No, really</a>. He can somehow prevent himself from being nuked, eaten by Jeff or erased from reality by Wanda with nothing more than a well-timed flex of his shoulders. If there’s an Iron Fist on the enemy team with even a moderate understanding of his toolkit, you’re in for a world of pain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, NetEase, do something about this man. My healers are dying.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

            <p>Borderlands 4 will dial down the toilet humour compared to the previous game, so don't expect any "skibidi" quotes.</p>
<p>Narrative director Sam Winkler described Borderlands 4 as Gearbox's "most ambitious game yet" and said he's happy to "work with some of the funniest people I know".</p>
<p>A response to Winkler's post asked if, judging by trailers, the game will have darker humour, to which he replied: "Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3's overabundance of toilet humor."</p>
<p>He added, in a further response: "I'm not gonna say there's no toilets but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder."</p>

<p>The Borderlands series isn't exactly serious in its tone, but the third game was criticised for its humour. For some, though, this didn't detract from its shooting mechanics.</p>
<p>Reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Eurogamer Borderlands 3 review</a>: "No, it's not a particularly cerebral experience, but nor is it trying to be; while stuffed with gore and violence and frankly infantile humour, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is a solid shooter with a meaty 30-ish hour campaign, plentiful - if repetitive - busywork, and a colourful cast of hard-to-forget characters."</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">new trailer for Borderlands 4 was shown</a>, which revealed its new planet and four playable vault hunters.</p>
<p>It's looking plenty outlandish, but the lack of poop and fart jokes will make for a more satisfying release once the game launches in 2024.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off game Nightreign will feature enemies from Dark Souls, its director has confirmed.</p>
<p>Souls fans certainly spotted some familiar enemies in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Nightreign's reveal trailer</a> at last week's The Game Awards, most notably The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> who rides atop a dragon firing lightning bolts.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477">Famitsu</a>, director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that a "small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign thanks to the "influence of the Night King".</p>

<p>He added this is to add to the sense of "chaos" that the night brings. It's all part of the parallel universe of Nightreign, which is clearly allowing FromSoftware to nod to its past.</p>
<p>As the Dark Souls social media account teased: "In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>And while Ishizaki specifically mentioned only the Dark Souls series, perhaps Bloodborne and Sekiro enemies could make an appearance too.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">IGN</a> spotted, the trailer includes player characters battling a three-headed creature with an exposed ribcage that appears to be the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls. Further, an official screenshot released by the developer includes a giant spider who could well be The Duke's Dear Freja from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption>Is this Freja? | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further, fans have likened the playable character the Duchess to Bloodborne's Lady Maria thanks to her quickstep ability, while Wylder's claw shot resembles the grappling hook of Sekiro. This is certainly more speculative, but judging by the increased mobility of the playable characters in Nightreign, there does seem to be some influence from across FromSoftware's previous games.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also described Nightreign to Famitsu as a dense but short game that condenses RPG fundamentals into a single mission.</p>
<p>Communication with others, meanwhile, will be with pins and gestures to continue the "loose connection" with fellow players established in previous Souls games. There won't be PvP this time, though, and there's no invasion method.</p>
<p>Lastly, within the roguelite structure, if players successfully pass all three days of the game's day and night cycle, they will obtain relics for various boosting effects.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">new sales total for Elden Ring</a>, which has now sold more copies than the entire Dark Souls series had prior to its release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mistwalker's FANTASIAN Neo Dimension JRPG can now be checked out prior to purchase, thanks to a new free demo released by publisher Square Enix on all platforms.</p>
<p>The demo lets gamers experience the game's first few hours and test the multi-dimensional battle mechanics. Moreover, as is customary with post-launch free demos, players will be able to continue their journey as Leo by carrying over their progress to the full game if they purchase it afterward.</p>
<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension initially launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive. However, it has recently debuted on PC and all main consoles (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), with great overall reception. The game designed by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi scored a nine out of ten in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Instead of attempting to do away with the tropes that have dominated the genre for a very long time, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension fully embraces them to deliver a compelling experience that feels markedly "Final Fantasy" without being an actual part of the series. The story, as a whole, may not be anything special, but the little interactions between the characters, some emotional moments, and the solid combat system, which only improves as the adventure proceeds and the challenge level increases, make for one of the best JRPGs released in the past few years.</em></p>

            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has been released to finally tackle issues with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> performance.</p>
<p>A new Balanced graphics mode has been added to combine Quality mode settings (and raytracing) with Performance mode resolution, targeting 40fps. It requires a display capable of achieving 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The Performance mode has been adjusted for a more consistent framerate, while raytracing in Quality and Balanced modes will have a less noisy image. Perhaps more damning is the ability to switch off the PS5 Pro's PSSR entirely.</p>

<p>PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony's AI upscaling technology, but it appears to be causing issues for some developers - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/improvements-to-alan-wake-2s-ps5-pro-patch-still-not-ready">Remedy included</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">latest patch</a> is available on PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S and PC. On those other platforms, a couple of minor fixes have been implemented as well as other optimisations.</p>

			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently participated in the virtual <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/2024-annual-shareholder-meeting?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annual Shareholders Meeting</a>, answering questions on a variety of topics that involve the corporation's activities. Usually, on these occasions, gaming is largely ignored, being a relatively minor portion of Microsoft's revenues.</p>
<p>However, this time around, Nadella was actually asked about the early ROI (return on investment) on the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and about progress made in 2024 on the overarching gaming strategy outlined by Microsoft. Nadella was very positive in his reply, and he also touched upon some of the brand's changes related to multiplatform releases.</p>
<p><em>I’m feeling very, very good about where we are in gaming. In fact, right now, this is like the peak season for gaming, obviously with Black Ops and the new Call of Duty, and it’s just been fantastic to see the launch and the marketing around it, the buzz around it and the love for gaming.</em></p>
<p><em>If I think about it, right, we chose the secular growth category in entertainment, which we think is gaming, and said, let’s double down on it, let’s – and it’s been a passion for Microsoft ever since.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, I think Flight Simulator launched before Windows or Office even, and so it’s like one of the longest franchises in this company. And so we said, let’s take that joy of gaming everywhere. And that’s why even these ads with Xbox now, where we are redefining what it means to be an Xbox fan, it’s about being able to enjoy Xbox on all your devices.</em></p>
<p><em>So our strategy with Activision content now is in full force. We feel fantastic about the progress we’ve made. And more importantly, I think, long term, as a company, we can bring the best of AI innovation, cloud innovation, console innovation, PC innovation to build the best games that can be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards 2024, Xbox fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that another of the former exclusives, The Outer Worlds 2, would launch day and date on PlayStation 5, too, after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/outer-worlds-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> only for PC and Xbox Series S|X back in 2021. It's another hint that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-exclusives-are-gone-for-good-says-jez-corden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> about Microsoft abandoning exclusives for good might be true. While fans may riot at the idea, it certainly makes financial sense, at least on paper.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has stated the company's belief that unique creativity is more important than development costs.</p>
<p>Discussing the rising cost of game development in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">investor Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto admitted the company's development expenses have increased each year. "Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>However, creative and intriguing ideas are most important, a view shared by other members of the Nintendo board.</p>

<p>"We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with," said Miyamoto. "With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo aims to nurture developers who "take this unique concept to heart", allocate funds as necessary, and release games "only after we are confident in the product".</p>
<p>Miyamoto added it's "possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs".</p>
<p>"We believe that not all products require large costs," he continued. "Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."</p><p>Senior managing executive officer and corporate director Shinya Takahashi commented: "I believe unique titles that are small in scale, but worth polishing can be created by expanding on the ideas of a small number of developers, rather than spending large sums of money on every game. While overall research and development costs are rising, there are certain products for which expenses remain relatively stable, depending on our approach."</p>
<p>Ko Shiota, senior executive officer and corporate director, added the merging of home console and handheld console for the Switch allowed Nintendo to integrate its development environments, which will continue with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Because we are already familiar with Nintendo Switch, maintaining a similar basis for development environments in the future will allow us to carry over the experience we have already built, which should lead to a reduction in research and development costs over time," he said.</p>
<p>The investor question follows high profile and expensive flops from the past year, including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> from Warner Bros. and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-initial-development-deal-was-reportedly-200m-though-its-financial-and-human-cost-was-far-higher">cancelled Concord</a> from Sony.</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is gearing up for its Switch 2 launch. While reports have suggested its graphics could be comparable to the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the ability to run Unreal Engine 5, its specs are likely to be less powerful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In this modern world of £700 consoles and iterative updates it’s easy to forget the extra expenses involved in gaming – especially when it comes to controllers. When even basic controllers cost upwards of £50 apiece, any kind of local multiplayer becomes extra expensive. Multiply those costs by the various competing consoles and you have a wallet-busting experience. Gamesir have become increasingly engaged in the console and PC accessory space in recent years and their latest controller promises to solve the dilemma of multiple expensive controllers by offering one that works across PC, Switch, and mobile gaming, at an accessible pricepoint.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir Tarantula Pro - Pro by Name, Pro by Nature | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20y-q2OJBag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multi-format controllers are not a new idea. My 8Bit-Do Pro is my go-to for Switch and emulation but the Tarantula offers a few new tricks and has swiftly become my main choice for PC gaming. Opting for a Playstation layout with two parallel analogue sticks at the bottom of the controller, the Tarantula feels immediately familiar and comfortable in the hand. The sticks themselves are TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) – an even more precise magnetic system than Hall Effect – rather than the more widely used potentiometer system and feel far smoother and more responsive than the main console competitors. The huge advantage TMR has over traditional controllers is the lack of moving parts subject to drift – a factor that is a real blight on both Xbox and Playstation pads. Alongside the sticks we have a mechanical D-pad that feels satisfying to use.</p>


<p>The default button layout for the Tarantula echoes the Xbox standard and even shares the colour coding system. However, one of the coolest options here is the ability to switch between controller profiles and adjust the button layout accordingly. Holding the mode button and the requisite face button operates the mechanism that changes the button layout to the alternative Switch standard. This mechanism is visible through a transparent section and is the kind of satisfying design that would have Alan Partridge purring.</p>


<p>Other than the transparent window revealing the gears that work the switch mechanism the controller has a dark camouflage pattern that is unobtrusive if a little underwhelming. There are RGB effects across the pad as well as the illuminated button layout but the colours and brightness of these are easily adjustable if you want a plainer controller. Aside from the main face buttons there are multiple programmable buttons that by default act as Start and Select (or the system equivalent). The increased options available through these buttons are an interesting addition but I didn’t really find myself using them that much.</p>
<p>More useful are the programmable back buttons that are becoming a more popular choice on controllers. Even better here is the fact that you can lock them using a physical switch and prevent them from being pressed accidentally. The increased functionality on the back of the pad continues with more physical switches that can adjust the triggers to be either analogue or microswitched. This is a really nice addition as it enables the controller to be quickly altered to suit different genres with the microswitches being perfect for shooters and action games whilst analogue better suited to driving games.</p>

<p>The Pro version that I’ve been using also comes complete with a nifty charging stand that sits nicely on my gaming desk and keeps the pad ready for action. It can be connected via USB-C if preferred as well as offering both Bluetooth and dedicated dongle connection. I opted for the latter and have had no issues with latency or lag throughout my time using it.</p>
<p>So far so positive, and as mentioned earlier the Gamesir Tarantula is my new main PC controller but I did encounter some odd problems when trying it out on Switch. Initially connecting the controller didn’t work unless the Switch was in handheld mode – a weird glitch as that is not really the ideal use case for a pad. Once the connection was made however it remained connected on the Switch mode and could be used without issue. I’ve decided to carry on using my 8Bit-Do pad for Nintendo gaming but that’s more to do with my own addiction to multiple controllers than anything being particularly wrong with the Gamesir pad. The instructions link to a Gamesir app but this appeared to only be in Chinese and didn’t seem to include the pad under review at time of testing.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gamesir Tarantula Pro is a fantastic pad that can work across multiple devices and offers a comfortable and responsive option. The Playstation layout may prove to be a divisive choice but for those that prefer parallel controls this represents a perfect solution for PC, Switch and mobile gaming. Even without the many hidden tricks and programmable buttons, this pad comes highly recommended.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Game Science’s CEO and founder, Yocar-Feng Ji, recently discussed Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Yocar-Feng Ji took to the Chinese social media platform, <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his dissatisfaction with Black Myth Wukong losing out on GOTY at TGA 2024. Feng Ji first spoke about how the award ceremony came along simultaneously with their ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively large update</a>‘ for the title and how this project has spanned 7 years. He then talks about how the game was nominated across four categories and won the Best Action Game and Players’ Voice award, with the latter being more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji reveals that he had “a sense of loss and regret” (as translated by ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PS5</a>) with Wukong not winning GOTY and states that the games nominated “were all exceptional”. However, he “can’t determine the criteria” for GOTY this year. Feng Ji said that he feels he came all the way to Los Angeles “for nothing”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji added that he was very confident about Black Myth Wukong winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024, so sure that he had written his acceptance speech “two years ago”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Black Myth Wukong has been a massive success for Game Science, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a> and breaking several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player records on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed China’s gaming industry to new heights in 2024</a>. Also, check out the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss Rush update</a> for the game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-unlock-kappa-dark-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tarkov-event-rewards-players-with-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-coveted-item.1063113/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has started a new pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov, and it rewards players with one of the most coveted, cherished items in the game’s ecosystem: Kappa.</p>



<p>The Kappa secure container is one of the items that the game’s most die-hard fans aspire to unlock after every wipe (read: game reset). It takes a huge amount of effort to grab one, but after completing this relatively simple quest from Battlestate Games, you can get your hands on one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-temporary-greatness">Temporary Greatness</h2>



<p>The only drawback to this event is that you’ll lose Kappa when the game wipes in the coming weeks – but for those weeks, you’ll feel like a legend. Typically, each new wipe brings around a ‘race to Kappa’, with many streamers participating to see who can unlock the aspirational item the fastest.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a task that requires collecting several rare items and completing dozens of in-game quests. The average player will never get within sniffing distance of Kappa before the game wipes, which is an event that takes place around once every six months.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-kappa-in-tarkov">How to Unlock Kappa in Tarkov</h3>



<p>To get Kappa, you’ll need to complete the new ‘Dark Times’ quest, given to you by Fence, one of Escape from Tarkov’s traders.</p>



<p>Dark Times requires players to venture into Factory at night and kill 30 targets using nothing but a TOZ-16, one of the game’s most cumbersome and pointless weapons. That being said, if you put the right ammunition into it, there’s no reason why you couldn’t get this task done in just a few raids.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you need to eliminate 30 <strong>targets</strong>, and not just PMCs. That means you can run in, blitz through fields of Scav enemies, and then hey presto, you’ve unlocked Kappa for the remainder of the wipe.</p>



<p>Have fun while the secure container is in your possession – it’ll be gone soon. Perhaps the added stash space will motivate you to chase Kappa next wipe, who knows?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-devs-admit-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-wasn%E2%80%99t-good-enough.1063107/</guid>

<p>In a blog post on the Call of Duty site, Activision has expressed what’s next for Team RICOCHET, the providers of COD’s anti-cheat mechanics. The post addressed the launch of Black Ops 6 and the subsequent release of Ranked Play, which was marred by an influx of cheaters that made grinding a miserable, impossible experience.</p>



<p>In a line, the team admitted that the anti-cheat systems used in Black Ops 6 simply weren’t good enough.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missing-the-mark">Missing the Mark</h2>



<p>In the blog post on the COD site, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, <strong>we did not hit the mark</strong> for the integration of RICOCHET Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 – particularly for Ranked Play.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, pro players worldwide were lamenting the state of Ranked Play, revealing clips showing them constantly brushing up against cheaters and malicious operators.</p>



<p>Further to the statement above, Activision went on to mention the obvious:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, several key changes are now being implemented. In addition to the 19,000 accounts already banned, the team is promising ‘increased velocity’ on suspensions, to kick cheaters from the game much faster. Team RICOCHET has also started to provide ‘further training’ for AI-based detection systems.</p>



<p>RICOCHET’s kernel-level driver and server-side protections are set to receive some serious upgrades that’ll be deployed alongside Season 02 and Season 03 in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december#:~:text=After%20a%20series%20of%20updates,01%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20for%20Ranked%20Play." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post was closed</a> out with a request to keep reporting cheaters whenever you see them because, after all, there’s only so much these automated systems can do.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Balatro Dev Takes To Social Media To Reflect on 18+ PEGI Rating]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-dev-takes-to-social-media-to-reflect-on-18-pegi-rating.1063104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-dev-social-media-pegi-rating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro secured the award for the Best Indie Game of 2024 at The Game Awards, a success that came just after the game shipped more than 3.5 million units. It has been a great year for Balatro, which was pieced together by a solo developer by the name of ‘LocalThunk’.</p>



<p>Recently, LocalThunk took to social media to rue the PEGI ratings change that was applied mere weeks after the game hit the market in February 2024. On Twitter, he compared Balatro to games like EA Sports FC, suggesting that he could drop his 18+ rated game to a 3+ rating if he added loot boxes and microtransactions to his game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-red-logo-looks-kinda-dope">‘The Red Logo Looks Kinda Dope’</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that LocalThunk doesn’t disagree with the 18+ PEGI rating that was given to his game in March 2024. He’s more ‘irked’ by the games that are given a lower rating despite having similar – or ‘worse’ – mechanics.</p>



<p>He uses EA Sports FC as an example, pointing out that they feature real gambling in the form of loot boxes and other, similar microtransactions. For the longest time, courts worldwide have debated the existence and purpose of loot boxes, and some territories have banned them entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</span></p></article></div>







<p>After posting this message on Twitter (now ‘X’), LocalThunk wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just to clear it up – I’m way more irked at the 3+ for these games with actual gambling mechanics for children than I am about Balatro having an 18+ rating</p>



<p>If these other games were rated properly I’d happily accept the weirdo 18+. </p>



<p>The red logo looks kinda dope</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=balatro&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-HRGPPBlRm8v8y6E9psaIxVdwU7I9vn_KrpZcbPWoxww&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PEGI platform</a>, the strong rating is justified by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game teaches – by way of images, information and gameplay – skills and knowledge that are used in poker. During gameplay, the player is rewarded with ‘chips’ for playing certain hands. </p>



<p>The player is able to access a list of poker hand names. As the player hovers over these poker hands, the game explains what types of cards the player would need in order to play certain hands. As the game goes on, the player becomes increasingly familiar with which hands would earn more points. </p>



<p>Because these are hands that exist in the real world, this knowledge and skill could be transferred to a real-life game of poker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Balatro is one of 2024’s strongest games, and it has pulled in remarkable reviews throughout the year.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s an inherent issue with games like EA Sports FC receiving such low ratings despite featuring loot box-like mechanics? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 reached its highest ever concurrent player peak this past Sunday, confirming to all that the iconic first-person shooter from Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very much not dead</a>. This peak came less than 24 hours after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trophy was lifted at the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>.</p>



<p>While this latest peak isn’t the highest in the history of Counter-Strike itself, it’s an incredible accomplishment for CS2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upward-trajectory">Upward trajectory</h2>



<p>The Counter-Strike 2 player peak reached 1,740,261 concurrent players this past Sunday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. This is the highest number of concurrent players on CS2 ever, roughly 180,000 more than the peak that was set when the sequel officially launched in September 2023. With the exception of June and July, the concurrent player peak has gone up every single month of 2024. Both monthly concurrent player peaks and player averages are up now compared to where they were when the year began.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new CS2 player peak did fall a few hundred thousand players short of the all-time peak set in May 2023. The all-time CS2 player peak of 1,818,773 concurrent players was brought on by both the release of the BLAST Paris Major viewer pass and the ongoing CS2 limited test. CS:GO player numbers jumped following the CS2 limited test announcement as players tried to increase their hours in hopes of getting access.</p>



<p>The Major typically brings in more players throughout its duration, as players make Pick ‘Ems selections, redeem souvenir packages, and open sticker capsules. Following Team Spirit’s victory, the players’ championship autographs will become available for purchase soon.</p>



<p>Despite widespread player concerns about the amount of content and the state of anti-cheat, among other issues, CS2 is showing no signs of slowing down or a diminished player count. It still remains the most actively played game on all of Valve by a considerable margin, and that likely isn’t changing anytime soon.</p>



<p>Is any game ever going to surpass CS2 on Steam? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

After the trailer debuted, viewers—many of them game developers—began speculating that the game or the trailer are using generative AI technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As internet sleuths dug through the business profiles of SuperAuthenti and its executives, some began to wonder if the game might also use blockchain technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company (like a cat) played coy at first, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/catly-announcement-game-awards-2024/">first telling Digital Trends</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it would share more details on the game in 2025. That seems to have changed. Today, a SuperAuthenti PR spokesperson told Game Developer that there is no generative AI in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or its teaser. Additionally, they said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is "not a blockchain game," and there are no </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamestop-s-crypto-plans-collapse-as-retailer-prepares-to-shut-nft-marketplace">non-fungible tokens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (NFTs) or other blockchain currency affiliated with the product.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We did not use generative AI to produce the video and the game," the spokesperson said. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculation. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that could produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">SuperAuthenti shared a work-in-progress video of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">trailer with Game Developer, which contained a number of before-and-after shots showing the pre-rendered kitties bouncing around their playroom. The cat's models did not appear to contain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models">telltale signs of generated 3D models</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (no unusual symmetry, no melded limbs, and no baked-in textures), and the environment also appeared to be created with traditional 3D animation. Some shots featured the cats rendered with full fur, others showed models implemented before fur animations were added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-devs-can-spot-ai-generated-3d-models" target="_self">How devs can spot AI-generated 3D models</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5954_rF8tU" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cat models did appear to have been fully mapped and rigged before these clips were captured, but it otherwise didn't seem that different from other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/H7pbEKZmYj0?list=PL2e4mYbwSTbbHAJT7OdK5mv-idhlLOTl0&amp;t=433">behind-the-scenes clips of CG animation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="SuperAuthenti says any there isn't any blockchain technology in ">SuperAuthenti says any there isn't any blockchain technology in <span>Catly</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As spotted by Digital Trends, Speculation over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catly</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s possible use of blockchain tech was based on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/tenthplanet-unveils-two-ambitious-blockchain-games/">a possible connection</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to blockchain game developer TenthPlanet.
