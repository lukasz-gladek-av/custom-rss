		<p>Square Enix has cancelled Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link, its GPS-based action RPG that was in development for iOS and Android mobile devices, but recommitted to the ongoing development of Kingdom Heart IV.</p>
<p>Announced back in 2022, Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link was looking to latch onto that Pokémon Go market with a planned launch in 2024. However, it was delayed at pretty much the last minute in November last year, and has now been cancelled entirely.</p>


<p>While I’m sure fans of this genre of mobile game were looking forward to a fresh take on it, separate to Niantic’s numerous entries, Square Enix determined that they just weren’t making a good game for the long haul. “We determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time,” they admit.</p>
<p data-characters="350" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">The much more important point for Kingdom Hearts fans is that Square Enix are still full steam ahead on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4.</a> This was also announced back in 2022, a good few years after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-hearts-3">Kingdom Hearts 3’s</a> release, and will kick off the new Lost Master Arc narrative. The lingering question will be how Missing-Link’s narrative will be folded into the next main game. Given how convoluted the Kingdom Hearts story is, how it’s been spread across so many different games and platforms (before its collated remasters), and how deeply invested the fanbase is in dredging up every morsel of story, it’s kind of appropriate that some of this will be lost or repurposed from a game called Missing-Link.</p>
<p>Here’s the full announcement from Square Enix:</p>

<p><em>We have made the decision to cancel the development of Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link.</em></p>
<p><em>We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service.</em></p>
<p><em>Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.</em></p>
<p><em>We would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks to everyone who gave us their support and assistance with the multiple closed beta tests. We are truly sorry to have to make this announcement.</em></p>
<p><em>The <a title="Series > Kingdom Hearts [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> series will continue. We are hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, and hope you’ll continue to support the series as you keep an eye out for further updates.</em></p>

			<p>This morning, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/files/077cbfa987cc7f8ee0eac7391eedb651.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with TBS TV to create a game based on an original intellectual property. TBS is one of five private broadcasters and is mostly known as the home of Ninja Warrior (known as Sasuke in Japan), a sports/reality show where a hundred participants compete in a four-stage obstacle course.</p>
<p>Here's the translated press release, which does not provide any details on the game itself (likely still in the concept phase):</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Co., Ltd. aims to continue to provide new experiences and value that will remain in the hearts and minds of customers around the world through its content and services, based on corporate philosophy of "Creating new worlds with limitless imagination. Under the new medium-term management plan, the Square Enix Group is working to deliver to customers a rich variety of content with solid appeal through the creation of new IP, the development of new business models, and the multifaceted development of IP.</em></p>
<p><em>TBS Television Inc. aims to be the starting point that moves society by delivering heart-stirring moments in a variety of fields. TBS' brand promise is to "create the world of tomorrow with the best of time. With this brand promise, we are taking on the challenge of pioneering digital content and growing into the global content brand "TBS". As part of these efforts, in July, we will launch our own game business brand "TBS GAMES" and focus on the creation of original IP originating from games. </em></p>
<p><em>Square Enix and TBS have decided to collaborate on the development of a completely new original IP game for both domestic and international markets, combining the experience and strengths they have cultivated in their respective fields. We hope you will look forward to the new original IP will be created by combining the knowledge of both companies in the entertainment field.</em></p>
<p>Considering the history of Square Enix, this could be a roleplaying game of some kind, but it's really too early to tell. However, we'll keep an eye on any news in the coming months.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">explained on the PlayStation blog</a>, the new update adds weapon customisation for all primary weapons, letting you complete missions and pay in-game currency to unlock attachments and skins. "Whether it’s tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you’re in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield," says the post.
</p>
<p>These newly tweakable weapons are proposed as a response to Illuminate heading towards Super Earth, and doing so with newly added enemy types. That includes "the Stingray", a flying enemy that can perform strafing runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>; "the Crescent Overseer", which can drop explosives on Helldivers behind cover; and the Fleshmob, a "Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy."
</p>
<p>"Voteless parts" is good. Good marketing, marketer.
</p>
<p>The in-game store has also been amended to offer items permanently, rather than only a rotating time-limited selection, meaning that you can now go pickup that fascist dandy cape you missed first time around. I like when developers decide to stop preying upon FOMO.

            <p>Sony sold 2.8m PlayStation 5 consoles in its most recent financial quarter, bringing total lifetime sales to 77.8m consoles.</p>
<p>That's down 1.7m units compared to the same period last year and leads the company to a total of 18.5m consoles sold this year compared to 20.8m last year.</p>
<p>Despite that slight drop, the PS5 is still roughly on par with the PS4, which sold 79.1m consoles after an equivalent time after release. What's more, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">previous quarter was the PS5's best-selling</a> with 9.5m sales over Christmas.</p>

<p>Even with that year-on-year drop in console sales, overall sales for the gaming sector are up nine percent, while operating income is up 43 percent.</p>
<p>That's largely down to an increase in third-party game sales, while first-party game sales have dropped. Notably, Sony hasn't had a major PlayStation Studios release since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> in September last year, which has sold 1.5m copies.</p>
<p>However, the number of monthly active users on the console remains strong at 124 million users, down from the record high of 129 million the previous quarter. Overall, this number has risen since last year.</p>
<p>Sony is forecasting a drop in both sales and profits for the next financial year, due to an expected decrease in hardware sales, which suggests console sales have peaked similarly to the PS4.</p>
<p>In April the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">raised the price of the digital PS5</a> in the UK, mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft also raised the price of all its Xbox consoles</a> in May - it's unclear if a further increase will come from Sony for its remaining console models across the globe, notably its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>As for software, Sony has a strong year ahead with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> out next month and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Ghost of Yōtei</a> out on 2nd October. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 delayed into 2026</a>, this new Ghost game should stand out at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 expands on the previous game with more experimentation and customisation, as well as a big dollop of Metal Gear.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-77-8-million-units-shipped-sony-forecasts-further-decrease-in-unit-sales-for-fy2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter financial report</a>, we learned that PS5 shipments have reached 77.8 million units to date. In the last quarter, Sony only shipped 2.8 million units of the PlayStation 5 console, a significant decrease from the 4.5 million units shipped in Q4 FY 2023. Full-year PS5 sales are also down: Sony sold 18.5 million units in fiscal year 2024, down from the 20.8 million consoles sold in fiscal year 2023.</p>
<p>Sony also shared the forecast for fiscal year 2025, and the expectation is that PlayStation 5 hardware sales will decrease even further. However, this will be offset by first-party software sales, which are expected to increase with the release of titles like Ghost of Yotei, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on October 2</a>.</p>
<p><em>FY2025 Forecast (year-on-year)</em><br>
<em>◼ Sales: 370.0 billion yen (8%) decrease</em><br>
<em>·(ー) Decrease in sales of hardware due to a decrease in unit sales</em><br>
<em>·(ー) Impact of foreign exchange rates</em><br>
<em>·(+) Increase in sales of first-party game software titles</em><br>
<em>·(+) Increase in sales of non-first-party game software titles including add-on content</em><br>
<em>◼ OI: 65.2 billion yen（16%) increase</em><br>
<em>·(+) Impact of increase in sales of first-party game software titles</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, even this year's PS5 hardware sales decrease was largely offset by software sales on PS4 and PS5, which increased from 2023's 286.4 million units to 2024's 303.3 million units. However, most of them were for third-party games, whereas first-party game sales decreased from 39.7 million units to 28.9 million units year-over-year. The digital download ratio of full game software sales on PS4 and PS5 rose from 2023's 70% to 2024's 76%.</p>
<p>Sony also highlighted the 5% year-over-year increase in Monthly Active Users (MAUs), which rose from Q4 2023's 118 million to Q4 2024's 124 million. Admittedly, there's the fact that some PC games now <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-pc-specs-are-out-and-theyre-quite-demanding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require access to the PlayStation Network</a>, which wasn't really the case last year. This could have contributed to the higher figure registered in 2024.</p>

He reached out to Watanabe, who had previously worked at <a title="Companies > 1-UP Studio [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nintendo/1-up-studio">Brownie Brown</a>, and asked if he would be interested in becoming president.</p><p>While Kameoka had not originally planned to sell the company, he later suggested Watanabe buy it, believing it would avoid complications after his death. Watanabe responded positively and things progressed from there.</p><p>Kameoka’s reason for approaching Watanabe, he said, was seeing a small company setting up a booth, launching its brand, and having a good time at Tokyo Game Show. He recalled thinking, “What am I doing? Aren’t these guys doing what I want and should be doing?”</p><p>Kameoka originally founded Brownie Brown, a separate studio, on June 30, 2000. On February 1, 2013, it became a support studio under <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> and was renamed 1-Up Studio. That same year, Kameoka left to establish Brownies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Brownies’ most notable releases include <em>Fantasy Life Link!</em>, <em>Egglia: Legend of the Redcap</em>, and <em>Doraemon <a title="Series > Story of Seasons [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/story-of-seasons">Story of Seasons</a></em>.</p><p>Thanks, <a href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/86438" target="_blank">Ryokutya2089</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game is launching on PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on July 29. While the charming life-sim game will be available digitally on all platforms, those who want a physical release will be able to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7MPVJ2W?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pick up a boxed copy on PS5</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7N1DWXH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> on launch day. The Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game physical edition will cost $40, and preorders are available now ahead of launch. No preorder bonuses have been announced, but it does come with a fold-out map of Bywater village and a download code for a digital soundtrack, so it's probably worth securing your copy ahead of time.</p><p dir="ltr">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game is a life sim set in The Shire--y'know, the idyllic corner of Middle-earth where Hobbits like Frodo, Bilbo, and Sam call home. The game will cast you as a Hobbit and give you your own plot of land in The Shire to cultivate and tend. There will also be plenty of side quests and activities to engage in, like fishing, foraging, and trading with or cooking meals for other Hobbits in Bywater village.</p><p dir="ltr">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game is one of several games getting "small batch" physical runs this year from companies like iam8bit, Limited Run Games, and more.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> now has so many animals, enemies, and entities that it can be hard to keep track of. If you're looking to build a wildlife sanctuary or just seeking some of the rarer mobs, you may want to know all of the animals, monsters, and other mobs in the game. Some of these can be tamed, bred, or even ridden, while others drop valuable loot when killed. Most mobs are also affected by the game's mechanics in the same way that you are--meaning they can be killed, drowned, or even catch fire. Here's the full list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival game</a>'s mobs.</p><div data-embed-type="toc" data-hide="true"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">show</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#All_Minecraft_passive_mobs">All Minecraft passive mobs</a><ul><li><a href="#Allay">Allay</a></li><li><a href="#Armadillo">Armadillo</a></li><li><a href="#Axolotl">Axolotl</a></li><li><a href="#Bat">Bat</a></li><li><a href="#Bee">Bee</a></li><li><a href="#Camel">Camel</a></li><li><a href="#Cat">Cat</a></li><li><a href="#Chicken">Chicken</a></li><li><a href="#Cod">Cod</a></li><li><a href="#Cow">Cow</a></li><li><a href="#Dolphin">Dolphin</a></li><li><a href="#Donkey">Donkey</a></li><li><a href="#Fox">Fox</a></li><li><a href="#Frog">Frog</a></li><li><a href="#Goat">Goat</a></li><li><a href="#Glow_Squid">Glow Squid</a></li><li><a href="#Happy_Ghast">Happy Ghast</a></li><li><a href="#Horse">Horse</a></li><li><a href="#Iron_Golem">Iron Golem</a></li><li><a href="#Llama">Llama</a></li><li><a href="#Mooshroom">Mooshroom</a></li><li><a href="#Mule">Mule</a></li><li><a href="#Ocelot">Ocelot</a></li><li><a href="#Panda">Panda</a></li><li><a href="#Parrot">Parrot</a></li><li><a href="#Pig">Pig</a></li><li><a href="#Polar_Bear">Polar Bear</a></li><li><a href="#Pufferfish">Pufferfish</a></li><li><a href="#Rabbit">Rabbit</a></li><li><a href="#Salmon">Salmon</a></li><li><a href="#Sheep">Sheep</a></li><li><a href="#Sniffer">Sniffer</a></li><li><a href="#Squid">Squid</a></li><li><a href="#Strider">Strider</a></li><li><a href="#Tropical_Fish">Tropical Fish</a></li><li><a href="#Turtle">Turtle</a></li><li><a href="#Villager">Villager</a></li><li><a href="#Wandering_Trader">Wandering Trader</a></li><li><a href="#Wolf">Wolf</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Minecraft_hostile_mobs">All Minecraft hostile mobs</a><ul><li><a href="#Blaze">Blaze</a></li><li><a href="#Bogged">Bogged</a></li><li><a href="#Breeze">Breeze</a></li><li><a href="#Creaking">Creaking</a></li><li><a href="#Creeper">Creeper</a></li><li><a href="#Drowned">Drowned</a></li><li><a href="#Ender_Dragon">Ender Dragon</a></li><li><a href="#Enderman">Enderman</a></li><li><a href="#Endermite">Endermite</a></li><li><a href="#Evoker">Evoker</a></li><li><a href="#Ghast">Ghast</a></li><li><a href="#Guardian">Guardian</a></li><li><a href="#Hoglin">Hoglin</a></li><li><a href="#Husk">Husk</a></li><li><a href="#Magma_Cube">Magma Cube</a></li><li><a href="#Phantom">Phantom</a></li><li><a href="#Piglin">Piglin</a></li><li><a href="#Pillager">Pillager</a></li><li><a href="#Ravager">Ravager</a></li><li><a href="#Shulker">Shulker</a></li><li><a href="#Silverfish">Silverfish</a></li><li><a href="#Skeleton">Skeleton</a></li><li><a href="#Slime">Slime</a></li><li><a href="#Stray">Stray</a></li><li><a href="#Vex">Vex</a></li><li><a href="#Warden">Warden</a></li><li><a href="#Witch">Witch</a></li><li><a href="#Wither">Wither</a></li><li><a href="#Wither_Skeleton">Wither Skeleton</a></li><li><a href="#Zombie">Zombie</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="All_Minecraft_passive_mobs">All Minecraft passive mobs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486737-minecraft-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486737" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486737-minecraft-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486737"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Allay</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486737-minecraft-mobs%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Allay">Allay</h3><p>The Minecraft Allay was added during The Wild Update and resembles a small, blue, fairy-like creature. You can find the Allay in Pillager Outpost cages or Woodland Mansion cages. Break the cage to set the Allay free, and it will become loyal as a thank-you for saving it from imprisonment. Give it an item to carry, and it will follow you, meaning leading it back to your base is simple. It'll also go and seek more of the same item, bringing it back to you.</p><p>After an Ally becomes loyal to you, you cannot harm them even accidentally, but they can lose health if it's attacked by another mob. If that happens, it can regenerate its own health. Breeding an Allay is different from most other mobs in the game, too, as they can self-duplicate without the need for a partner. To do this, use an amethyst shard on an Allay while it's dancing to jukebox music.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486754-minecraft-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486754" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486754-minecraft-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486754"></a><figcaption>Minecraft armadillo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486754-minecraft-mobs%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Armadillo">Armadillo</h3><p>The armadillo was added to Minecraft in April 2024 as part of the Minecraft Live mob vote. It can be found in groups of two or three in the Savanna and Badlands biomes. Approaching it quickly will cause it to curl up scared, so sneak towards it if you want to get near. Spiders are afraid of armadillos, so having some at your base should keep the arachnids at bay. While you cannot tame an armadillo, it can be bred using spider eyes. Armadillos periodically drop scutes, or you can harvest scutes by using a brush on them. Scutes can be used to craft wolf armor, making them a valuable item. It takes six scutes to make wolf armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486831-minecraft-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486831-minecraft-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486831"></a><figcaption>Different colored axolotl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486831-minecraft-mobs%286%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Axolotl">Axolotl</h3><p>Minecraft axolotls can only be found in Lush Caves. While not technically a biome, they are huge openings in deep caves. We've found more luck in finding these under jungle biomes thanks to the humidity. Look for an Azalea tree above ground to signal that a Lush Cave could be below. Axolotls spawn within five blocks of clay, so keep an eye out for them when seeking them out. You can collect an axolotl in a bucket before creating an enclosed habitat for them to live in at your base. As they can't be tamed, if the axolotl is set free near your base, it will swim away. They need to live in water at least two blocks deep, and can be bred using buckets of tropical fish. There are multiple colors of axolotl in the game, including leucitic, wild, gold, cyan, and the rarest one--blue. Blue axolotls can't be found in the wild and must be bred. Axolotls will attack aquatic creatures with the exception of frogs, turtles, dolphins, and each other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486830-minecraft-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486830-minecraft-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486830"></a><figcaption>Minecraft bats</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486830-minecraft-mobs%285%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Bat">Bat</h3><p>Bats can spawn in groups of eight in dark areas anywhere below block layer 63. They don't drop any items or experience points upon death, so the only reason for killing them is if you keep getting jump scared by their screeching and swooping when you're trying to avoid hostile mobs in caves. When idle, they can be spotted hanging upside down from solid blocks, but if you approach, they'll fly away. The same happens if the block they're hanging from is broken. They can't be tamed, bred, or interacted with in any way. They simply just exist. Good for them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486829-minecraft-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486829-minecraft-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486829"></a><figcaption>Minecraft bees in a flower forest</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486829-minecraft-mobs%284%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Bee">Bee</h3><p>The Minecraft bee is responsible for the production of honey, making it a valuable mob to interact with. We've got more information in our dedicated Minecraft bee guide. Bees will generally keep to themselves unless you provoke them or their hives, and just like in real life, they'll die if they sting you. You'll want to keep a campfire on hand if you're going to try harvesting honey from their hives too, as this keeps them calm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486828-minecraft-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486828-minecraft-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486828"></a><figcaption>Riding a camel through the desert.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486828-minecraft-mobs%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Camel">Camel</h3><p>Camels, while fairly rare, can be found in deserts and desert villages, and can be ridden by up to two players at the same time. Camels do not respawn if they're killed, so if you see one, you'll want to quickly saddle it. Finding two and feeding them cacti will cause them to breed, and considering their rarity, this is highly recommended. Camels also have an extra inventory slot, where you can store the saddle. Camels can spring, and saddled camels can dash and charge. You'll see an additional dash charge bar which fills as the camel is being ridden, and using the jump button executes the dash. As camels are tall, while riding one, you cannot be reached by zombies, vindicators, hoglins, silverfish, endermites, and piglins. Most hostile mobs will never attack a camel, so riding one at night is a straightforward way to stay safe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486832-minecraft-mobs%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486832-minecraft-mobs%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486832"></a><figcaption> A black cat lying on a bed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486832-minecraft-mobs%287%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Cat">Cat</h3><p>The most useful way to employ a Minecraft cat is to ward off Creepers and Phantoms, who are terrified of them. You can find cats in villages or swamp huts, and they can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon. There is a high chance that a cat will bring you a gift in the morning if it has not been commanded to sit, and if you slept in a bed at night and not during a thunderstorm. You can find out more in our dedicated Minecraft cats guide.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4488896-minecraft-mobs-all.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4488896" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4488896-minecraft-mobs-all.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4488896"></a><figcaption>Minecraft chicken</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4488896-minecraft-mobs-all.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Chicken">Chicken</h3><p>The chicken spawns naturally in most overworld biomes in Minecraft, and you can usually tell one is nearby since they lay eggs that can be collected. They also cluck pretty annoyingly, but that's another matter. Killing a chicken will drop feathers and raw chicken meat. Their eggs can be thrown to the ground and have a small chance of spawning another chicken. To tame and breed chickens, you can use any type of seed. Chickens are one of the only mobs that don't take fall damage. Chickens have three variants--temperate, cold, and warm, exclusive to specific biomes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489207-minecraft-mobs-all%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489207-minecraft-mobs-all%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489207"></a><figcaption>Minecraft Cod</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489207-minecraft-mobs-all%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Cod">Cod</h3><p>This passive aquatic mob looks like the real-life fish of the same name. You can find it swimming in ocean biomes, and they are more prominent in cold or lukewarm areas. When killed they drop raw cod which can be used to tame cats, or cooked for food. You can catch them with a fishing rod or in a bucket, as a bucket of cod, meaning you can move them from the ocean to any in-game aquariums or fish tanks you may have built. Cod can't be tamed or bred.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489208-minecraft-mobs-all%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489208" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489208-minecraft-mobs-all%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489208"></a><figcaption>Minecraft cow variants</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489208-minecraft-mobs-all%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Cow">Cow</h3><p>The Minecraft cow comes in three variants--temperate, cold, and warm, exclusive to specific biomes. Cows drop raw beef, which can be cooked into steak, a high-value food especially in the early game. They also occasionally drop leather, which is needed to craft books and item frames, among other Minecraft crafting recipes. If you use a bucket on a cow, they can be milked indefinitely. Given milk removes status effects such as poison, this is very helpful. Use wheat to tame and breed cows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489209-minecraft-mobs-all%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489209" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489209-minecraft-mobs-all%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489209"></a><figcaption>Minecraft dolphins can lead you to treasure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489209-minecraft-mobs-all%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Dolphin">Dolphin</h3><p>Dolphins are useful in Minecraft since they have the ability to guide you to high-value loot and areas. It spawns in the ocean, unless it's frozen, and swimming near a dolphin will give you the Dolphin's Grace effect, greatly increasing your swimming speed. If you feed a dolphin raw cod or salmon, it will swim towards the nearest buried treasure or ocean ruins. Dolphins can leap out of the water, mirroring their real-life counterparts, and dropping an item into the ocean near a dolphin triggers it to chase after it.</p><p>They cannot be tamed or bred, and need water to survive, so trapping them on land will cause them to die. However, building an underwater tunnel to guide them into an enclosed underwater space at your base? Totally allowed, and even encouraged (by me). Try sailing a boat near dolphins and watch how they interact with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489210-minecraft-mobs-all%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489210" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489210-minecraft-mobs-all%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489210"></a><figcaption>Tie a Minecraft donkey to a post using a lead</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489210-minecraft-mobs-all%284%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Donkey">Donkey</h3><p>Donkeys behave much like horses, but with one important exception--they can carry items. They spawn in plains or savanna biomes, and can be ridden once tamed. Taming a donkey involves repeatedly mounting it until it accepts you. Donkeys can also be equipped with chests, giving them up to 15 more inventory slots, and making them useful for across-map travel with important valuables. While they can wear saddles, they cannot have horse armor applied. Donkeys can be bred with golden apples or golden carrots, and breeding one with a horse will produce a mule.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489211-minecraft-mobs-all%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489211-minecraft-mobs-all%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489211"></a><figcaption>Minecraft foxes sleeping under a tree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489211-minecraft-mobs-all%285%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Fox">Fox</h3><p>The fox is one of the most adorable mobs in Minecraft. It usually spawns in the taiga biomes in small groups, and they can be red or white, depending on the biome type. They are very anxious and will flee from you unless you're sneaking when approaching. Foxes can carry items in their mouth, including weapons and food, which they may use or eat. To breed foxes, you'll need to use sweet berries, and if a baby is born from two player-bred foxes, it will trust you and not run away. At night, foxes will hunt chickens, rabbits, and small mobs, and will attack mobs that are holding food.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489212-minecraft-mobs-all%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489212-minecraft-mobs-all%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489212"></a><figcaption>Three cold-variant frogs</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489212-minecraft-mobs-all%286%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Frog">Frog</h3><p>I wish frogs were more easily found in Minecraft. They will only spawn in swamp or mangrove swamp biomes, although they do come in three color variants-- temperate, warm, and cold. Frogs can jump exceptionally high, and they eat slimes and magma cubes. When a frog eats a slime it will drop a slimeball, and if it eats a magma cube it creates a froglight. This decorative block matches the color variant of the frog that created it. Frogs are tamed and bred using slimeballs. Instead of laying eggs, they create frogspawn, which hatches into tadpoles, eventually evolving into frogs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489213-minecraft-mobs-all%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489213-minecraft-mobs-all%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489213"></a><figcaption>A Minecraft goat observes the land from high up</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489213-minecraft-mobs-all%287%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Goat">Goat</h3><p>Goats are found in mountain biomes, usually at some obscure angle up the side of a cliff, bleating that they can't get back down. Goats can jump up to ten blocks high, and when they feel threatened, they'll charge and knock back players or other mobs. If a goat rams into a solid block, it has a small chance to drop a goat horn, which can be used to play different sounds. The unofficial screaming goat mob is thought to bleat more aggressively and ram harder than its counterpart. Goats can be bred using wheat, and don't drop meat or leather upon death.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489214-minecraft-mobs-all%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489214" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489214-minecraft-mobs-all%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489214"></a><figcaption>The glow squid is easily seen in dark waters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489214-minecraft-mobs-all%288%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Glow_Squid">Glow Squid</h3><p>Glow Squids, much like their duller counterparts, are a passive aquatic mob. They spawn in dark underwater areas, but their subtle glow means they're easily spotted. When killed, they drop glow ink sacs, which can be used to craft glow item frames. The items inside these stand out in the dark. Combining glow ink sacs with dye means you can make the text on your signs glow, too. Glow squids do not shoot ink, and they don't flee from you when you're nearby.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489887-minecraft-ghasts%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489887" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489887-minecraft-ghasts%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489887"></a><figcaption>Ghasts wearing harnesses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489887-minecraft-ghasts%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Happy_Ghast">Happy Ghast</h3><p>The passive alternative to the hostile mob is the Minecraft Happy Ghast. While we've got a dedicated guide on how to find, tame, and ride them, the most important thing you need to know is that they look adorable wearing their harness. They can carry items from one place to another in a hot air balloon-style contraption, and you can ride on them with up to three friends. They'll also stay still when a player is standing on their back, meaning construction high in the air is easier than it's ever been.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489215-minecraft-mobs-all%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489215" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489215-minecraft-mobs-all%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489215"></a><figcaption>A player rides a horse in diamond armor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489215-minecraft-mobs-all%289%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Horse">Horse</h3><p>Horses spawn in plains or savanna biomes, and they can be tamed, ridden, and bred. To tame a horse, you just need to repeatedly attempt to mount it until it accepts you. They have a huge variety of colors, and they're not exclusive to specific biomes unlike other mob variants. They can wear horse armor, providing additional protection. Use golden apples or golden carrots to breed horses. Their offspring will inherit specific traits from their parents, such as movement speed or health. Horses drop leather, occasionally saddles, and occasionally horse armor when killed. Breeding a horse and a donkey will create a mule that can carry chests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489216-minecraft-mobs-all%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489216" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489216-minecraft-mobs-all%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489216"></a><figcaption>Iron Golem protecting his villagers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489216-minecraft-mobs-all%2810%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Iron_Golem">Iron Golem</h3><p>Iron Golems are found in Minecraft villages, and they're a passive mob ... until they're not. The Iron Golem serves as a protector of the village and can be crafted to protect your own base, too. They are useful defense mechanisms during raids or hostile mob attacks, as they have a high health pool and strong attacks.

Llamas can carry items in their chests, granting up to 15 more inventory slots on the move. Llamas can be combined to make a caravan, which allows you to control all llamas at once. When tamed, which is done by attempting to mount them multiple times like a horse, they can be ridden. When provoked, llamas will spit to attack. You'll need to tame two llamas and then feed them both hay bales in order to breed them.

This rare biome can be spotted due to the mushroom-shaped trees. Mooshrooms resemble red and white cows with mushrooms growing on their backs in their most striking form, but you can find brown Mooshrooms, too! They can be milked, and mushroom stew can be produced in this way. Mooshrooms can be bred using wheat to create baby Mooshrooms. When struck by lightning, the Mooshroom may transform into a normal cow, and vice versa. If a Mooshroom is fed mushroom stew, it will consume the stew but return it to your inventory. Mooshrooms are a fantastic food source thanks to their infinite mushroom stew capabilities, but the rarity of the biome means it's difficult to track them down for most players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489222-minecraft-mobs-all%2813%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489222" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489222-minecraft-mobs-all%2813%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489222"></a><figcaption>A mule is created by breeding a horse with a donkey</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489222-minecraft-mobs-all%2813%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Mule">Mule</h3><p>The mule is a hybrid that occurs when a horse and a donkey are bred together. The mule will inherit the donkey's ability to carry items in a chest, but will be faster than a donkey. Mules cannot be bred together, so to get more of them, you must breed more horses with donkeys. Mules need a saddle to be ridden.

They're smaller and only spawn in jungles. Like cats and foxes, they will flee when approached unless you're sneaking. Ocelots cannot be tamed, but you can earn their trust by feeding them raw cod or salmon. In Bedrock, they're passive, but in Java, they'll be hostile. Using raw cod will reduce their hostility towards you and reduce the likelihood of them fleeing. Ocelots are immune to fall damage, and Creepers and Phantoms are also afraid of them. You can breed ocelots with raw cod and salmon, creating an ocelot kitten, which moves faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489224-minecraft-mobs-all%2815%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489224" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489224-minecraft-mobs-all%2815%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489224"></a><figcaption>Two pandas eating bamboo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489224-minecraft-mobs-all%2815%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Panda">Panda</h3><p>Pandas will naturally spawn in bamboo jungles, and they're incredibly adorable. There are variants, but rather than changing their color, their nature will change. You can get normal, lazy, playful, worried, and aggressive pandas. The only color variant is the brown panda. These personalities will change the way the pandas behave. Using bamboo will tame and breed pandas, with their babies inheriting traits from each parent. Sometimes, when a panda sneezes, a baby panda is born. Pandas drop bamboo when killed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489225-minecraft-mobs-all%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489225-minecraft-mobs-all%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489225"></a><figcaption>Many parrots in the jungle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489225-minecraft-mobs-all%2816%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Parrot">Parrot</h3><p>Minecraft parrots' most endearing trait is their love of dancing.

They can be tamed and bred using any seeds. Parrots can also mimic the sound of other mobs, such as creepers or zombies.

They spawn in most overworld biomes, and now have three different variants depending on the biome they spawn in. Pigs can be ridden using a saddle, but they're not as fast as horses, so they're not often used in this way. You can use a carrot on a stick to decide the pig's movement direction.

It's common to see an adult polar bear with its cub, and this is where you need to be cautious. Adult polar bears become hostile fast if a player approaches or attacks their cub, as they're very protective. Their melee attacks can deal a reasonable amount of damage, too, so an angry mama polar bear is definitely one to avoid. When killed, they drop raw cod or salmon.

These small, spiky mobs inflate whenever someone gets too close, causing poison damage and knockback. They can appear small, medium, and fully puffed, and with each stage of inflation, the damage they deal increases. Pufferfish drop raw pufferfish when killed. You can eat it, but it causes poison and hunger. Instead, try using pufferfish in potions such as the water-breathing potion. You can collect pufferfish in a water bucket to transport them to your base for an aquarium or fish tank.

They prefer it in the lava--if you observe one on the land, you might notice it's shivering, meaning it's cold. To ride a Strider, you'll need to get a saddle on it, and control it using a warped fungus on a stick. Striders can also be bred using warped fungus.

There are almost 3,000 variants of tropical fish available, mostly referring to their color combinations, but also their pattern and body shapes. You can collect tropical fish alive in a bucket, meaning you can build a truly ambitious aquarium full of tropical fish if you have enough buckets available. When killed, they drop raw tropical fish, which are used to tame axolotls. Their nutritional value is so low that they're not worth cooking or eating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489875-minecraft-mobs-all%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489875-minecraft-mobs-all%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489875"></a><figcaption>A baby turtle sits atop its parent's head</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489875-minecraft-mobs-all%2827%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Turtle">Turtle</h3><p>Turtles usually spawn on the sand near warm ocean, but have been known to spawn on any sand. They are incredibly slow on land, but can swim quickly. After being bred with seagrass, turtles return to the beach where they hatched in order to lay their own eggs. You can collect these eggs and move them to your own beach, as the turtles will remain here after they have hatched. Turtle eggs take a notoriously long time to hatch, and they can be trampled by players or other mobs, so make sure to keep them nice and safe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489876-minecraft-mobs-all%2828%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489876-minecraft-mobs-all%2828%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489876"></a><figcaption>A Villager farming</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489876-minecraft-mobs-all%2828%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Villager">Villager</h3><p>Villagers are a specific type of passive mob that only spawn in a village. They are humanoids and have the ability to trade with players. They also have distinct professions that determine which goods or services they can offer-- blacksmiths, librarians, farmers, and more all offer valuable items that can be traded for emeralds. Villagers are bred using bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, to create a baby villager. There must be enough beds in the village for this to happen. Villagers also level up through trading, meaning they will offer better items and enchantments. If you've ever witnessed a raid on a village, you'll know that Villagers are terrible at fighting and will run away instead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489877-minecraft-mobs-all%2829%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489877-minecraft-mobs-all%2829%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489877"></a><figcaption>A player offers a milk bucket to the Wandering Trader</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489877-minecraft-mobs-all%2829%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wandering_Trader">Wandering Trader</h3><p>The Wandering Trader will occasionally appear across the map accompanied by two llamas. He offers various goods in exchange for emeralds, and will often bring items you don't yet have. His items are randomized, and there's no way to influence the items or offers that he has from day to day. Traders, unlike Villagers, cannot be bred or employed. If you don't interact, the Wandering Trader will just leave your vicinity in peace. However, if you attack him, both he and his llamas will try to attack in return.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489881-minecraft-mobs-all%2830%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489881-minecraft-mobs-all%2830%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489881"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489881-minecraft-mobs-all%2830%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wolf">Wolf</h3><p>The wolf is often referred to as the dog in Minecraft since it mimics real-life canines. They spawn in forests, taigas, and snowy biomes, and are typically found in packs. Take a good stack of bones with you, as feeding them a few will tame them and cause them to follow you. You can also command them to sit or stand, or attack mobs. Wolves will defend you even when not commanded to, making them a great traveling companion in a single-player survival game. You can also breed wolves with bones. You can heal your wolf by feeding it cooked meat. You can easily tell your wolf's health status by the position of its tail--if it's lifted high, your wolf is feeling well, but if it's drooping down between its legs, it probably needs some meat pretty quickly.</p><h2 id="All_Minecraft_hostile_mobs">All Minecraft hostile mobs</h2><p>While there are plenty of passive mobs to invite to your base, whether that's for food, practicality, function, or you just think they're cute, there are also plenty of hostile mobs who are just waiting for the sun to set so they can ruin your day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489889-minecraft-mobs-all%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489889-minecraft-mobs-all%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489889"></a><figcaption>A triggered Blaze prepares to attack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489889-minecraft-mobs-all%2831%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Blaze">Blaze</h3><p>The Blaze can be found in Nether fortresses, and drops Blaze Rods upon death. It's the only source of Blaze Rods, which are essential for getting to The End and completing the game, so you'll have to encounter them at some point if that's your goal. They spit fireballs from range, or if you get too close they will spin and attack with their rods. Blazes are immune to fire or lava damage, and they can also fly to get a good view of their prey. The most effective way to deal with a Blaze is to throw snowballs at it, or push it into powder snow. They will target and attack you if you're within 48 blocks of them, and it will alert other Blazes in the area if it is attacked by you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489895-minecraft-mobs-all%2832%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489895" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489895-minecraft-mobs-all%2832%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489895"></a><figcaption>A Bogged waits under a tree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489895-minecraft-mobs-all%2832%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Bogged">Bogged</h3><p>Bogged spawn in the swamp biomes, but can also appear in Trial Chambers. They may drop bones, arrows, poison arrows, or damaged bows upon death. They act similarly to skeletons, and shoot poison arrows at nearby players. They are very slow to reload their bows compared to skeletons though, so you have time to get attacks in if you find yourself face-to-face with one. They have less health than a skeleton too, so they don't pose much of a threat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489946-minecraft1.21thebreezemobreveal0-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489946" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489946-minecraft1.21thebreezemobreveal0-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489946"></a><figcaption>The Breeze attacks in a Trial Chamber</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489946-minecraft1.21thebreezemobreveal0-25screenshot.png"></figure><h3 id="Breeze">Breeze</h3><p>The Breeze behaves in a similar way to the Blaze, but it is found in Trial Chambers only. It hovers in the air and sends wind charges flying towards you. It drops Breeze Rods upon death, which can be crafted into Wind Charges and Maces. They are guaranteed to drop Breeze Rods, but only if the death counts as player-inflicted, meaning you can't drop heavy items on them to kill them. They are immune to projectile damage, and even able to repel incoming projectiles back at you, so put that bow away.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490030-minecraft-mobs-all%2833%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490030" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490030-minecraft-mobs-all%2833%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490030"></a><figcaption>A Creaking looms over a player</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490030-minecraft-mobs-all%2833%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Creaking">Creaking</h3><p>The Creaking spawns in the Pale Garden biome from a Creaking Heart. The Creaking Heart must be activated either at night or during a thunderstorm. Looking at the Creaking within 12 blocks will alert it, if there is no player within that radius then it will return to its idle state. If looking at a Creaking, it is unable to attack you unless you're wearing a carved pumpkin on your head. If you're not looking at it, it will move towards you to attack. If the Creaking is spawned from a Creaking Heart it cannot take any damage, but a trail of orange particles will appear between it and its heart. Resin clumps will also ooze from nearby Pale Oak logs. Destroying the Creaking Heart will cause the Creaking to disintegrate. Illagers are scared of Creakings and will run from them. Creakings are immune to fire, lava, Warden, Zoglin, and Wither damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490052-minecraft-mobs-all%2834%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490052-minecraft-mobs-all%2834%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490052"></a><figcaption>A charged Creeper next to a regular one</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4490052-minecraft-mobs-all%2834%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Creeper">Creeper</h3><p>I've lost count of the amount of times I've screamed and sworn at a Creeper that snuck up on me. They don't earn their name for nothing. These silent mobs will sneak up to you on sight before hissing and exploding, causing you damage and destroying or dismantling any blocks or mobs nearby. Creepers can be struck by lightning, causing them to become Charged Creepers, which explode with more violence. It also allows for nearby Piglin, Zombie, Skeleton, and Creeper heads to be collected if they die as a result of that explosion. The only overworld biomes a Creeper will not spawn in are Mushroom Fields and Deep Dark.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493254-minecraft-all-mobs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493254-minecraft-all-mobs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493254"></a><figcaption>A Drowned on the ocean floor</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493254-minecraft-all-mobs.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Drowned">Drowned</h3><p>The Drowned is the underwater version of the Zombie, and spawns in oceans, rivers, and dripstone caves, or can be formed if a regular Zombie drowns. They swim through the water towards you and use melee attacks, although some Drowned have a trident which can be thrown long distances. This is the only way to get a trident for yourself though, so if you hear that ominous 'ding' noise and you're wanting one for yourself, it may be best to fight the natural instinct to run. They may also be holding a fishing rod or a nautilus shell. It's also possible for them to spawn riding a chicken, creating a Drowned chicken jockey. Husks can transform into a normal Zombie and then into a Drowned. Drowned never naturally spawn wearing any armor, but if they were a regular Zombie wearing armor that then transformed into a Drowned, it's possible to find an armored one. They drop rotten flesh upon death, and can also drop copper ingots. Drowned are the only source of renewable copper, meaning setting up a farm to turn Zombies into Drowned and then killing them is a good way to set up a copper farm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493255-minecraft-all-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493255" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493255-minecraft-all-mobs%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493255"></a><figcaption>Promotional art for the Ender Dragon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493255-minecraft-all-mobs%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Ender_Dragon">Ender Dragon</h3><p>The Ender Dragon is a giant flying boss found in The End, and it's the largest naturally spawning enemy in the game. The Ender Dragon guards the entrance to the End gateways. Without beating the Ender Dragon, you cannot get to the outer End islands. Beating the Ender Dragon is considered the end of Minecraft, as the credits will roll as soon as you jump through the portal back to the Overworld after defeating it. After beating the Ender Dragon you can re-summon it by adding End Crystals to the exit portal. The Ender Dragon drops 12,000 XP and a Dragon Egg. The dragon is immune to status effects, but can take damage from explosions and players. Occasionally, it will shoot Dragon's Breath towards the land, which pools. Stepping in those pools, even when the Dragon has stopped firing, will damage you over time. You can use glass bottles to collect Dragon's Breath--useful for creating lingering potions. There's plenty more information on this boss mob in our Ender Dragon guide.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493258-minecraft-all-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493258-minecraft-all-mobs%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493258"></a><figcaption>An Enderman holding Warped Nylium in the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493258-minecraft-all-mobs%283%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Enderman">Enderman</h3><p>The Enderman is a tall mob found in the overworld, the Nether, and the End. Endermen will usually ignore players, but if you look into their eyes, they'll become hostile and attack. They can be harmed by water, so if you find yourself surrounded by them, especially when fighting the Ender Dragon, it's best to create a pool of water and stand in the middle of it. Sometimes they'll collect blocks. Killing Endermen will give you an Ender Pearl sometimes, making them vital to take down if you're trying to get to the End. Once an Enderman sets its sights on you, it will pursue you until it is killed or distracted by rain or fire. Ranged attacks are pointless on an Enderman, as instead of taking damage, it will teleport to safety.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493257-minecraft-all-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493257-minecraft-all-mobs%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493257"></a><figcaption>Endermites emit purple particles similar to Endermen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493257-minecraft-all-mobs%282%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Endermite">Endermite</h3><p>While the Ender Dragon is the largest hostile mob, the Endermite is the smallest. It may spawn whenever you throw an Ender Pearl. They attack by biting, and Endermen are hostile towards them. They have a 5% chance of spawning and will spawn where the Ender Pearl lands. It will despawn within two minutes unless you name it with a name tag. They don't drop anything other than a small amount of experience points. Since Endermen become hostile towards them, you can use a name tag on an Endermite in the End to easily farm Endermen. It's important to create an area for the Endermite to exist that will attract Endermen, but where they cannot reach to kill them. Create a trap near to the Endermites for the Endermen to fall into.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493261-minecraft-all-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493261" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493261-minecraft-all-mobs%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493261"></a><figcaption>An Evoker casts its fangs spell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493261-minecraft-all-mobs%284%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Evoker">Evoker</h3><p>The Evoker is a spell-casting Illager found in woodland mansions and raids, and killing it is the only way to get a Totem of Undying. It has two spells--one which summons armor-piercing fangs, and one which summons Vexes. They do not respawn once killed, making them rarer than most mobs. Evokers may be found riding a Ravager during a raid. They move quickly--at the same speed as your sprint, meaning they can cover a lot of ground when trying to attack. If an Evoker is not in combat, it can change the color of any sheep from blue to red, though no one really knows why they choose to do this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493262-minecraft-all-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493262-minecraft-all-mobs%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493262"></a><figcaption>Three Ghasts fly around the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493262-minecraft-all-mobs%285%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Ghast">Ghast</h3><p>The Ghast is the original, hostile version of the Happy Ghast. It spawns in the Nether and can sometimes be heard crying before it attacks. It attacks by sending a series of projectile fireballs towards players, which knock them back. This means traversing narrow bridges in the Nether can be fatal if a Ghast spots you, as you can soon descend into the lava below from just one of their fireball attacks. When killed, they drop Ghast Tears, gunpowder, and experience points. If a Ghast is in close range, its own fireballs can kill it, although it is usually immune to fire or lava damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493269-minecraft-all-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493269-minecraft-all-mobs%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493269"></a><figcaption>A Guardian attacks some Squid</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493269-minecraft-all-mobs%286%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Guardian">Guardian</h3><p>Guardians look like underwater mines, with tails and orange spikes.

If you come across bastion remnants in the Nether, it's likely you'll find stables that also house Hoglins. They'll attack any player, but wearing an item of gold armor prevents this. If a Hoglin is taken to the Overworld or the End, it will transform into a Zoglin after 15 seconds. It's the only hostile mob that can be bred, and you'll need to feed it Crimson Fungi to do this, although it will not tame the Hoglin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493273-minecraft-all-mobs%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493273-minecraft-all-mobs%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493273"></a><figcaption>A Husk spawns in the desert biomes</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493273-minecraft-all-mobs%288%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Husk">Husk</h3><p>The Husk is a variant of the Zombie that spawns in the desert biome.

When a Magma Cube finds you within 16 blocks, it will leap towards you. They can jump forward twice as fast as any other mobs. When you kill a Magma Cube, it will split into smaller Magma Cubes, which also need to be killed.

Piglin Brutes appear in bastion remnants and do not barter like Piglins do. They also cannot be distracted by gold. Wearing gold armor or offering gold to a regular Piglin will stop them from attacking you, and can open the bartering interface, where Piglins can offer rare materials in exchange for gold ingots. The Piglin Brute holds a golden axe and will charge at you to attack. If a Piglin spots you holding a gold item, it will snort with jealousy. Piglins are afraid of zombified piglins, zoglins, and soul fire, torches, lanterns, and campfires. If it sees any of these, it will scream and run away. You might see up to three baby Piglins riding a baby Hoglin--weird, but cute. Mining gold in the Nether in sight of a Piglin will cause all of them nearby to turn hostile and attack you, even if you're wearing gold armor. Like a Hoglin, if a Piglin finds itself in the overworld or the Nether, it will be zombified.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493277-minecraft-all-mobs%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493277-minecraft-all-mobs%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493277"></a><figcaption>We've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493277-minecraft-all-mobs%2812%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Pillager">Pillager</h3><p>Pillagers can be found in wandering patrols, at pillager outposts, or during raids.

They continuously spawn in pillager outposts, and may spawn as captains. On death, they may drop a crossbow, an ominous banner, or an ominous bottle. Drinking a Bad Omen potion gives a status effect that lasts for 100 minutes, but it can be removed by drinking milk.

A Shulker may spawn a new one of the same color if it's hit with a Shulker bullet. When the Shulker gets hit and has half of its health remaining, it has a one in four chance to try and teleport without spawning a new Shulker. There's a 50% chance of a Shulker dropping a Shulker Shell upon death.

They're very hard to aim at and kill, and move very fast around your feet, biting to attack. They infest stone and deepslate blocks in mountains, strongholds, igloo basements, and woodland mansions. Attacking a silverfish causes more silverfish nearby to emerge from the block they've infested to attack. You're usually likely to find Silverfish in the end portal room of a stronghold on your way to the End. They don't drop anything other than experience points, can't be tamed or bred, and generally only exist to be an annoyance, in my experience. It's possible to find yourself surrounded by hundreds of them very quickly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493289-minecraft-all-mobs%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493289-minecraft-all-mobs%2816%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493289"></a><figcaption>Skeletons can spawn in the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493289-minecraft-all-mobs%2816%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Skeleton">Skeleton</h3><p>Skeletons are one of the more common hostile mobs. They spawn at night or in areas with low light, and they use a bow and arrow to shoot from range. The only biomes they don't spawn in are the mushroom fields or the deep dark, but they can spawn in groups of up to four. It's possible for a skeleton to spawn riding a spider. Four skeleton horsemen will spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, usually during a thunderstorm. The skeletons ride skeleton horses and usually have enchanted bows and iron helmets. They do spawn in the soul sand biomes of the Nether, although far less often than they spawn in the overworld. When they're killed, skeletons can drop bones, arrows, any naturally spawned equipment or bows, and experience. If a charged Creeper kills a skeleton, it may also drop its skull. They will chase players, baby turtles, and iron golems.

They spawn deep underground in swamp biomes, or in specific 'slime chunks,' and attack by jumping at you. Larger Slimes split into smaller ones when they die, and they come in three sizes. They spawn most often during a full moon and never during a new moon. A slime chunk is determined in the game's code by combining its coordinates with the world's seed. A random number between 0 and 9 is generated, and if the number is 0 the chunk can spawn slimes. If a Slime is killed by a frog it will always drop one slimeball. If it's killed by you, it will drop between 0 and 2 slimeballs. They also drop experience points relative to their size--4 for large, 2 for medium, and 1 for small. Due to the way a Slime splits when it's killed, it's possible to get up to 28 experience from one large Slime and all of the subsequent smaller Slimes that split from it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493292-minecraft-all-mobs%2818%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493292-minecraft-all-mobs%2818%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493292"></a><figcaption>Promotional artwork for the Stray</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493292-minecraft-all-mobs%2818%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Stray">Stray</h3><p>A Stray is a skeleton variant that spawns in some snow-covered biomes.

You can create a Stray by trapping a normal skeleton inside powder snow. After seven seconds, it will begin to shake, and after a further fifteen seconds, it will become a Stray. Even if the skeleton had minimal health left, when transformed into a Stray, it will regain full health.

The appearance of the Warden makes me feel like Minecraft isn't a survival game at all, but a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/" data-ref-id="2900-4900">horror game</a>. He's incredibly powerful, and is summoned by sculk shriekers in the deep dark. It can swing its arms down to the ground to deal the strongest melee damage in the game. It also has a sonic boom attack that can reach through obstacles. Wardens are completely blind, relying on vibrations, smell, and touch to detect you. Therefore, you can use wool or sneak to avoid it. Throwing a snowball or shooting an arrow in a different direction to distract it are also effective techniques.</p><p>The Warden is spawned if a player or mob activates a sculk shrieker three times. It will emerge hauntingly from the ground nearby, as long as another Warden isn't within 24 blocks of it. A Warden drops a sculk catalyst upon death, and only five experience--which, considering the difficulty you are met with when trying to face one, feels very low. After spawning, the Warden will move randomly around the world, following vibrations from nearby players. It can also sniff the air around it to locate you, even if you're not moving. If it picks up a movement, smell, or vibration, it will become increasingly angered. Even if the Warden isn't angered, it will cast a darkness over all players within 20 blocks of it, every six seconds. At the same time, you'll hear its heartbeat, which speeds up as it gets angrier. The Warden actually has more health than the Ender Dragon, so killing it can be exceptionally difficult.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493300-minecraft-all-mobs%2821%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493300" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493300-minecraft-all-mobs%2821%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493300"></a><figcaption>Witches standing on a lilypad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493300-minecraft-all-mobs%2821%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Witch">Witch</h3><p>The Witch uses potions to her advantage, as weapons in the form of splash potions, and drinking potions for defense and healing.

Some witches always spawn as part of raids from the third wave onwards. A villager will transform into a witch if lightning strikes within four blocks of it. Witches can drop sticks, glass bottles, glowstone dust, redstone dust, spider eyes, gunpowder, and sugar.

It's undead, hovers in midair, and fires explosive wither skulls at enemies. It considers anything living to be an enemy, and it's the only source of Nether Stars in the game. These are used to craft Beacons, making the Wither an essential opponent to face at some point if you'd like Beacons in your base. To spawn a Wither, place four blocks of soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and then placing three wither skeleton skulls on the top three blocks. The last block placed must be one of the skulls. When the Wither spawns, it is immediately angered and creates a large explosion. The Wither always drops a Nether Star, but also drops 50 experience points.</p><p>As the Wither's health bar fills up upon spawning, it grows in size and cannot be damaged in this state. The spawn sound of the Wither can be heard across the map in all dimensions. It has 300 health points, more than the Ender Dragon but less than the Warden. It is immune to fire, lava, drowning, and freezing, but it is vulnerable to weapons with the Smite enchantment. When it takes damage, the Wither breaks all blocks within a 3x4x3 area surrounding it, including blast-resistant blocks such as Obsidian. The only blocks it cannot break are End Portals, Bedrock, End Portal Frames, End Gateways, Command Blocks, Structure Blocks, Jigsaw Blocks, Light Blocks, Moving Blocks, Moving Pistons, and Reinforced Deepslate. Whenever a Wither kills another mob, a Wither Rose is planted as long as it is on grass, dirt, moss, mud, soul sand, soul soil, or netherrack. It can passively regenerate its own health every second, and instantly heals itself when it kills a target directly. When its health gets to halfway depleted, it will get wither armor, making it immune to arrows and tridents.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493306-minecraft-all-mobs%2823%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493306" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493306-minecraft-all-mobs%2823%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4493306"></a><figcaption>Wither Skeletons in the Nether</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4493306-minecraft-all-mobs%2823%29.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Wither_Skeleton">Wither Skeleton</h3><p>Wither skeletons are taller skeleton variants that wield stone swords.

They are also the only renewable source of coal, so they can be used to set up a farm for this purpose. On Halloween, Wither Skeletons can spawn wearing a carved pumpkin, but this isn't dropped upon death. The Wither spawns Wither Skeletons when it's below half health. Wither Skeletons can spawn riding a spider or cave spider in the Nether, but since neither spawns naturally in the Nether, it would need to be player-created.

If you're near a village at night, up to 20 zombies could spawn in the village, known as a siege. Zombies drop rotten flesh, but also have the potential to drop an iron ingot, carrot, or potato. Zombies actively seek out turtle eggs and baby turtles to attack, as well as villagers and wandering traders. When the sun comes up, zombies will set fire and die. On the hard Minecraft difficulty, Zombies can break down doors.</p><p>While that's all of the Minecraft mobs for now, the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-minecraft-update-release-date/1100-6530316/" data-ref-id="1100-6530316"> next Minecraft update</a> could always introduce more to the survival game.

                <p>Tetris Forever earned positive reviews when it released last year, and now it’s gearing up for a physical release on August 28 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8CZZRQ3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8D3B4QV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palia-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something uniquely satisfying about putting down roots in a sleepy town in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">Stardew Valley</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>. Palia evolves this tradition to great effect, injecting large-scale multiplayer into that tried-and-true formula. After 50 hours of chopping down trees, hunting woodland critters, decorating my home, and hanging out with my fellow Palians, I’ve had a fantastic time catching up on all I’ve missed since the early days of the beta. I still have to dive into the new content and loads of updates that arrived today with its console launch and first major expansion, Elderwood, but I am eager to do so ahead of my final review.=</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia is a cozy life sim with one major tweak: you’re in an online world that occasionally compels you to come out of your shell and interact with other humans – a sometimes Herculean task for the introverts often drawn to this genre. As you explore, you’ll encounter others out in the shared world going about their business, and are encouraged (or sometimes required) to cooperate with them. For example, you’ll get a buff for fishing with others and will find magical trees that can only be chopped down with the help of one or more friends. This has led to a community that’s astoundingly positive and helpful, with the vast majority of the public chat being PSAs from players who have found a valuable resource they’d like to share with strangers, then waiting for minutes on end for everyone to assemble before collecting it as a group. I spend a lot of time playing multiplayer games defined by the community’s potent toxicity and savage greed, so this kind of culture has truly been a shock to my system that I’m still adjusting to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although multiplayer is its signature twist, you can still do the vast majority of Palia’s activities by yourself. There’s also just a whole heck of a lot for you to do however you decide to tackle it, all in service of building up your home and improving your relationships with the NPC townsfolk. The usual zen-like staples like cooking and catching bugs are all here and actually quite good – the fishing minigame, for example, is less mindless than you usually find in the genre, having you tug and pull on your rod as the fish leaps into the air and puts up a fight. There’s even a few less common options like hunting, where you’ll pick off poor critters who burrow into the ground and leap into trees as you pepper them with arrows. While an absence of stress is an intentional focus of Palia’s design, it sometimes tries a bit too hard to accomplish that goal, like in how your arrows will magically home in on your target incredibly aggressive, sometimes turning corners to aid your aim. I’m all for a laid back experience, but it can be a bit obnoxious when you’re trying to line up a shot and the magnetism training wheels curve your arrow toward a different creature altogether, frustrating what’s supposed to be a chill activity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia has a surprisingly full-featured main story as well. It has you exploring ancient ruins to uncover the truth about a world which was once populated by humans who are curiously gone now, and the dark history of magic that seemingly caused the collapse of society. This adventure is much more light-hearted than that might sound though, and you’re mostly just given opportunities to learn about the world and hang out with the characters who accompany you on quests while you platform around and solve simple puzzles. Per Palia’s adherence to cozy virtues, none of this is particularly demanding, and the mainline quests can be completed in a matter of hours if you focus on them, but I enjoyed diving just a tad deeper into the world and the break from grinding for iron ore to craft the next piece of furniture I just couldn’t live without. The story was quite incomplete ahead of the Elderwood expansion though, so I’m intrigued to see where it picks up after that abrupt end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Palia has one of the better home building systems I’ve seen. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s other minigames that further mix things up, like a hotpot-themed card game I spent way too much time playing, or a surprisingly intricate platforming puzzle that took me hours to master. Sometimes these experiments exceed Palia’s grasp, like the platforming puzzles in particular, which are held back by clunky controls that don’t seem like they were designed with precision in mind. Climbing can be a quite irritating experience as your character will let go of surfaces inconsistently, sending you plummeting to your death. Thankfully the stakes in taking these spills are always very low, so there’s not much to lose aside from a bit of your time wasted, but it can definitely make some of the quests feel a bit tacked on. Other times, you’ll find yourself doing a sliding picture puzzle and think “y’know, this is pretty nice,” so I mostly found myself happy they took these shots nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the purpose behind all these various undertakings is to gain as much gold as you can to upgrade and decorate your home, and Palia has one of the better home building systems I’ve seen. Rather than giving you no control over the blueprint of your house like in Animal Crossing or Disney Dreamlight Valley, or making you monkey around with a building mode that has you placing individual walls like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024">The Sims</a>, Palia favors a modular system: You unlock schematics for pieces of a home that you can freely snap onto various parts of your building, making it easy to design the general layout without having to get lost in the weeds. Then, once you’ve built your place, you can decorate it down to the most minute detail, dragging furniture, dolls, and cups around on a grid to make it just so. I could probably spend dozens of hours on this part of Palia alone, were it not for my insatiable need for cold hard cash to fund my homestead expansion. But that desire to make your place exactly as awesome as you want it to be is a serious motivator that sent me out in search of lumber and iron ore time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those resource grinds each have their own progression systems as well, as you level up by repeatedly going out into the world and bringing back your haul of raw materials and collectibles to sell. I played dozens of hours of Palia as part of an early preview way back before it was even in its current open beta (and had my save file from that time tragically deleted), and the biggest change has been that its progression systems for these activities are much more streamlined and feel less grindy. Now, as you plant trees and craft furniture, you’ll unlock new equipment like a loom for creating fabric or a furnace for creating glass. You’ll also get better tools to perform cozy chores with, like a hoe that lets you till land faster or a bow and arrows that will let you take down prey in fewer shots, each of which feels like a handy upgrade that shows up at exactly the right moment you start feeling a need for it. The timegating that sometimes boxes you out of marathoning through everything in other life sims is mercifully absent here for the most part, so you can move as fast or as slow as you care to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major pursuit in Palia is in getting to know and develop relationships with its 25 NPC residents, most of whom are really well-written and have a lot more to them than meets the eye upon first glance. I quite enjoyed hanging out with the sarcastic and moody daughter of the mayor, Kenyatta, who worked the front desk with all the enthusiasm of April from Parks and Recreation – but after helping her down the extremely chaotic path of discovering what she’s passionate about in life, I grew to appreciate her in a less superficial way. Even characters I really didn't jive with, like the cryptid-obsessed hippy who annoyed me to no end, Elouisa, was at least entertainingly irritating and I’ve learned to appreciate how much her personality bothers me over time. (We’ve all got a friend like that, don’t we?) Most characters have an arc that takes place over several quests where they let you see a bit more of their personality as you forge a friendship. And, of course, if you’re looking for more than friendship you can partake in Palia’s quite strong dating mechanics to get yourself a girlfriend or boyfriend, or several of them – no judging here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Relationships are the one area where timegating gets in the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is one area where timegating gets in the way of a good time, and is one of the only places Palia boxes you out. You’re only allowed to chat with each character once per in-game day (a 30-minute period of real time), which improves your social links a very small amount, and you can only give each character a gift once per real world day. So if you’re trying to finish a particular character’s story, you’ll have to log on with regularity and be subjected to the same rotation of brief banter before you’re able to make any real progress. This is especially painful early on when your citizenship in Kilima Village is dependent on having someone in town to vouch for you – a task that’s made impossible to do in a short span of time by timegating. When every other area of Palia lets you play to your heart’s content, it’s pretty annoying to see such an essential part of this slice of life block you from progressing at your own pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia has come a long way since I played it over a year ago, but one thing that remained true ahead of this latest update is that it’s still missing quite a bit. The two maps I’ve explored are fairly small, and though they’ve got nooks and crannies to run around, you can more-or-less see most of what’s available in a few hours. Social features, though awesome when they happen, still feel quite slim for a game where the killer feature is supposed to be its online functionality, and there aren’t enough activities that encourage group play. And although there are quite a few options for decorating your house, surprisingly little of it can be interacted with once placed. You can’t lie in bed, turn on the sink, or really do much of anything with most objects, which sometimes made me feel like I was building a museum rather than a home. They did add the ability to flick the light switches on and off, which is at least something, but there’s a lot missing. These are all issues likely to be built out in the future, and I’m interested to see if Elderwood helps at all, but I’m a bit surprised that some of these aren’t farther along all the same.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major issue with Palia has been its bugs and performance issues on PC, which have gotten remarkably better since I last played, but are still pretty common. I quite frequently see NPCs sink into the floor, sometimes altogether hidden underground to the point where I can’t interact with them, there’s a bunch of very visible pop-in that happens while you’re running around, and loading times when traveling between each section of the map feel far longer than they should. Playing on the Nintendo Switch is especially eyebrow raising, as everything looks pretty awful and runs significantly worse, to the point where I really can’t recommend it on that platform in the same way I enthusiastically would elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve put quite a bit of time into Palia over the past week and have had a hard time putting it down, even as I’ve completed all the major activities available before the Elderwood expansion arrives. I’m looking forward to seeing how it runs on the PS5 and Xbox, checking out the new area and quality of life improvements, and continuing my chase for unlimited money to flex on my friends with my meticulously decorated estate.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/palia-temp-score-1747169197396.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster of the classic 2014 puzzle game, and not just because of the Unreal Engine 5 boost it gave the graphics. It added a whole new expansion on top of the original game and the Road to Gehenna DLC, a prequel to the game's story called In the Beginning.</p>
<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for players to solve, and what makes it and The Talos Principle: Reawakened particularly special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of these 18 puzzles</a> were designed in collaboration with members of the game's community, people who had been making puzzles themselves for the last decade because they loved the game and its mechanics.&nbsp;Which also explains why these puzzles are some of the most difficult ones to solve across the entire Talos Principle series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Conundrum Cascade puzzle. However, if you just want a hint before reading the full solution, then what I'll say is, don't forget to use the ladders. I think if I said anything more, I'd give away too much.</p>
<p>If you want me to give more away, read on for the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Conundrum Cascade Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the hexahedron and both connectors</h3>
<p>To start solving this puzzle, you need to get the hexahedron that's behind a shield on the right side of the puzzle area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan that is on the ground and in front of a pressure switch right in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area to deactivate the shield blocking the path to the hexahedron.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the hexahedron and place it on the pressure switch in the middle of the puzzle area when you walk into the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan back on the vent in front of the hexahedron, and use it to fly up into the air to grab the first connector (C1). Drop back down to the ground with C1 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Connect C1 to the red laser generator in the middle and the red node on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan and place it on the vent that was sitting behind the shield that is now deactivated by C1. Grab the hexahedron and let the fan launch you into the air onto the platform in the middle of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron on the left-most pressure switch to activate the vent and fan next to it.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Launch yourself to a smaller platform where you'll find a switch that will keep the shields blocking your path to the ladders permanently deactivated. Flip the switch, and jump down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>For this next part, you can either use the fan to launch yourself back up to the taller platform in the middle of the puzzle area, or climb the ladder, but the point is you need to get back up there, and drop the hexahedron and the fan that was already up there down to the ground. Collect the hexahedron, both fans, and C1 together. Place one fan on the vent, then place the hexahedron on top of that fan, with C1 on top of the hexahedron.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the other fan down on the pressure switch so the hexahedron and C1 are flying in the air.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder to climb up to the top of the platform and grab C1 and the hexahedron. Place the hexahedron next to the window on the right side of the platform, and then connect C1 to the red laser generator and the red node that will deactivate the shield blocking the path to the second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and use either of the fans to deactivate the first shield with the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area, and grab C2. Bring C2 into the middle of the puzzle area before you put it down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you've acquired all the tools you need to actually go ahead and solve the puzzle.</p>
<h3>Phase Two - Go for the solve</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C2 and connect it to the red laser generator and the red node on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one of the fans and place it on the vent. Grab the other fan and launch yourself and the fan back up to the platform in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan back on the vent at the top of the middle platform. Grab C1 and place it on the left-most pressure switch to activate the fan. Pick up the hexahedron to launch yourself and the hexahedron to the smaller platform on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, and jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red node on the opposite side of the wall that's on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder, or use the fan to launch yourself back up to the middle platform. Grab the fan off the vent, and drop down to the ground, and place it on top of the vent that's on the ground in the middle of the puzzle area. Grab the other fan and place it down next to the pressure switch on the ground in the middle of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the ladder leading up to the smaller platform, and grab the hexahedron. Place it on fan overtop the vent and then place the other fan on the pressure switch to have it flying through the air. Head up the ladder to put the hexahedron back on the middle platform.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator and C2, then place it on top of the hexahedron like you did earlier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and use the ladder leading to the shorter platform to step on the pressure switch, so the laser can pass through and hit C2. Once C2 activates the node behind the wall, you can step off the switch with the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one of the fans and place it on the vent next to C2. Grab the other fan and launch yourself, with the second fan, up to the middle platform. Place the fan on either of the two pressure switches to the right of the pressure switch that activates the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground and stand next to C2. Pick it up, and for the final time, launch yourself to the middle platform.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Connect C2 to C1, and to the red node that will deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino. Place it down on the pressure switch next to the switch you placed the fan on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>The fan and C2 standing on their pressure switches will deactivate the shield at the top of the middle platform, allowing the laser to pass through and hit the node to deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino. Jump down to walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how to solve the Conundrum Cascade in the new In the Beginning expansion that came with The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

            <p>
I think it's kind of under-appreciated how funny Tetsuya Nomura is. In recent years his social media presence has become quite mysterious, in that he'll just kind of drop some kind of cryptic tease on Twitter and then not explain himself. Despite not having revealed a single drop of information about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> since its announcement three years ago, Nomura <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1905427039227887864">hinted at some deeper lore about the series' paopu fruit</a> in a very nonchalant manner. It's just funny at this point! And he's done it again, this time with a Magic the Gathering card.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If you didn't know, Magic the Gathering is getting an entire Final Fantasy themed set that will probably single handedly get many people into Magic the Gathering. Yesterday, a whole bunch of cards from the set were revealed, including some special ones with fancy art. Unsurprisingly, everyone's favourite long-haired, long-sworded Sephiroth is a card with two bits of art, one with his regular look, the other his final boss form. It's that second one, "Safer Sephiroth", that Nomura has commented on that has me, and many others, wondering if it's actually a nod toward <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> 3 (or whatever it's called).
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card. I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked," Nomura explained. "There is also a reason that the design for Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."
</p>
<p>
Of course you can't share more about that, Nomura! When can you! Why even bring it up in the first place? I doubt most people would have even noticed, and now you're going to be fueling fan theories for the next two years. In case you don't know what Safer Sephiroth looked like in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, his right arm was just a wing. In this new art, he has both arms and that wing.
</p>
<p>
What could this mean? Maybe it's to keep Cloud and co out of arm's way (sorry)? Mostly, I have no clue, I'm just quite tickled by the fact that Nomura seems to get a kick out of dropping comments like these. Anyway, I'm off to sell a couple of organs to be able to afford a few booster boxes of this set because I do actually want that Sephiroth card!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend, I finally pulled the trigger on watching <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-movie-review-florence-pugh-marvel-studios-disney-2000595603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s <em>Thunderbolts*</em></a>, and yeah, it’s not that bad — a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/eyezehuhh/film/thunderbolts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solid three and a half stars on Letterboxd</a>. My only gripes were that those <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-jake-schreier-breaks-down-its-big-post-credits-scene-2000597900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two after-credit scenes</a> weren’t worth missing the night bus home, and I wish the film had stuck to its escape-room-style opening act instead of veering into being <a href="https://aftermath.site/marvel-thunderbolts-movie-im-so-tired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bog-standard Marvel movie</a>. The most annoying part of it is, it almost was the movie I was hoping for.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for the movie’s first act.</strong></p><p><em>Thunderbolts</em>’ premise is pretty straightforward — granted, I had to pick my brain to remember all the characters it threw into its cast to comprise its post-<em>Endgame</em> “<a href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1919425100853477455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Avengers</a>” like fumbling in your kitchen utility drawer, fishing for batteries you're sure must be there. Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character is a shady government official on the verge of being impeached for her super-secret and highly illegal superhero experiments. To cover her tracks, she enlists a bunch of depressed stragglers plucked from various small marquee MCU projects: Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Natasha Romanoff’s depressed little sister from that <em>Black Widow</em> you couldn’t pay me to watch; John Walker (Wyatt Russel), the crash-out divorce court Captain America from <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, which bored me to tears; Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) from the second <em>Ant-Man</em> movie that barely registers in my memory banks; and Taskmaster (lol). Their mission is to bury the evidence stashed at the bottom of a bunker somewhere in a random desert.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Marvel Studios’ T̶h̶u̶n̶d̶e̶r̶b̶o̶l̶t̶s̶* #TheNewAvengers | &quot;She Wants Us Gone&quot; Official Clip" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TD1Htfj785Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After a <a href="https://youtu.be/7X8yvwKHmR8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-executed fight</a>, remarkably coherent despite Marvel’s tendency to cut action scenes like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by4UZ-79MK4&amp;pp=ygURbGlhbSBuZWVzYW4gZmVuY2U%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Neeson scrambling over a fence</a>, the team realizes they’re included among the evidence they were sent to get rid of. The <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suicide squad</a> on suicide watch then rally together to break out of the locked evidence room before a bomb detonates, shimmy their way out of a well by linking their elbows and walking up its walls <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFkd73G0fDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Emperor’s New Groove</em>-style</a>, and hold their own against an incoming militia hell-bent on finishing the job.&nbsp;</p><p>In the chaos, they stumble upon a mysterious civilian named Bob, locked in a box in the now scorched evidence room. Of course, the trailers and months of casting blogs already revealed that Bob is Sentry, the film’s central villain. The crew assumes that his presence indicates that this is an escort mission on top of their escape room situation, until they’re forced to relive the darkest moments in their lives when he makes direct contact with them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ABSOLUTE CINEMA | MARVEL STUDIOS’ THUNDERBOLTS* | MAY 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqnRzjPfb5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Wouldn’t you know it, this Marvel movie had me leaning forward and fully engaged because, for once, it felt like a film. Twenty minutes into the movie, I started to believe Marvel wasn’t just throwing around indie-film buzzwords for the sake of marketing. That they leaned into boasting a cast from <em>Midsommar</em>, <em>A Different Man</em>, and <em>You Hurt My Feelings</em>; the writers and director of <em>Beef</em>; the cinematographer of <em>The Green Knight</em>; the production designer of <em>Hereditary</em>; the editor of <em>Minari; </em>and the composers of <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>. With director Jake Schreier (Kendrick Lamar’s “<a href="https://youtu.be/eAR2V7PZiIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We Cry Together</a>”) at the helm, Thunderbolts felt like it could be wildly different from middling Marvel slop I’d sat through before — less about an apocalyptic beam in the sky or widespread destruction of a metropolitan city, and more about the characters themselves through the underutilized escape room genre.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, there’s still fun with the movie, depending on your tolerance for David Harbour delivering non-sequiturs in a thick Russian accent as Red Guardian. But I couldn’t help slinking into my seat, frustrated at the missed potential for Marvel to pull a <em>WandaVision</em> by making an unconventional premise (for them) that I would’ve loved to have watched instead. Basically, I was deprived of viewing what I believe could’ve been Marvel’s version of <em>Cube </em>(1997).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Cube (1997) - Trailer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Esjc0rPj3K4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Cube</em>, directed by Vincenzo Natali, is a 1997 Canadian sci-fi horror film. It follows a group of strangers who wake up trapped in a mysterious maze of interconnected cube-shaped rooms. Despite being identical, each room has its <em>Saw</em>-like traps inside, leading the group to decipher each room’s deal, chart a safe course out of the maze, and keep their paranoia in check before they go postal and start killing each other out of frustration. One of my favorite scenes is when the ragtag group cleverly figures out they can spring traps by tossing a shoe into the rooms. Only, their pump fake isn’t foolproof because a guy gets a face full of acid and dies after doing the shoe trick. <em>Cube </em>rocks, and for a moment, I thought <em>Thunderbolts </em>was gearing up to channel that same energy until it didn’t. What makes the situation even more maddening for me is that Marvel was originally going to do something similar to my fan-crafted storyline, until it changed plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel/598425/thunderbolts-original-script-changes-die-hard-breakfast-club-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, original <em>Thunderbolts </em>screenwriter Eric Pearson revealed that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/how-depression-became-the-villain-of-thunderbolts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the original scripts</a> for the movie saw it take on a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-a-bottle-episode-meaning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bottle episode</a> approach where its characters would’ve done pretty much what I wanted them to do above, saying:&nbsp;</p><p>The notes I got toward the beginning were like, “Let’s make this contained and very grounded.” And when you throw out<em> Die Hard</em> in your movie pitch, everybody just latches onto that” So yeah, they’re in this deathtrap, and I think they got out more toward the end of the second act, as opposed to the midpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>But that was maybe the first one or two drafts. And then as we folded in Bucky, as we folded in Bob, it pretty quickly became the midpoint. And then when Jake came on, he really wanted a little bit of road-trippiness in the second half of act two. At some points, we had way too much road trip stuff going on, when the movie really should be gaining momentum. But [with early drafts] you’re trying out new ideas, and some of them are ridiculous. But you try ‘em out and you’re able to scrap ‘em and move on.</p><p>Despite Pearson admitting that his original take on the film wasn’t “very good,” he maintained that the core structure of the final film remained largely the same as his initial pitch — save for Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige tagging on one note that the low-stakes MCU movie would ultimately tie into the film <a href="https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-gives-the-mcu-its-new-avengers-now-what-2000595218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebranding its team as the New Avengers</a>.</p><p>“And I was like, ‘Oh, okay, cool. That’s your problem for later. And if that’s the only note that you’re giving me from this, then hell yeah, I’m going to take the money and run, and go start writing this movie,’ Pearson told <em>Polygon</em>. “I’ve been in plenty of Marvel pitches. You don’t get out of them with one note very often.”</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The more I dug into <em>Thunderbolt</em>’s production after watching it, the more frustrating it became knowing it had all the ingredients for a genuinely spectacular, refreshingly different Marvel movie baked into its DNA. Instead, <em>Thunderbolts</em> remains, well… a Marvel movie, though granted it's pretty decent. I wouldn’t go so far to celebrate it solely for being a triumphant return to form for the MCU, but it's definitely a competent film that even CinemaSins wouldn’t ding for having the basics: a well-structured script, poignant themes, legible action, a director with an actual vision, and music that isn’t an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the film is good in that Marvel way — a carefully calibrated, user-retention way. It’s the kind of structured reliability woven into every MCU entry, like jangling keys designed to keep kids and middle-aged men transfixed with what’s next instead of what’s right in front of them. That said, the last time a director dared to break convention was Sam Raimi’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-marv-1848869929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness</em></a>, and it sent folks into hysterics over <a href="https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-multiverse-madness-unpopular-opinions-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how uncharacteristically non-superhero it was</a>. So my wishful thinking about <em>Thunderbolts</em> embracing its boldest instincts would never make it past Marvel’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assembly-line approach to filmmaking</a>.</p><p>Still, suppose I had Sentry’s power during <em>Thunderbolts</em>’ production. In that case, I’d channel my inner Lady Macbeth, whispering — or more likely, screaming — “<em>Cube</em>” into director Schrier’s ear until he commits to making <em>Thunderbolts </em>a bizarre, different, and bold escape room horror thriller, rather than barely getting away with coloring outside the lines of the Marvel formula.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hag-capisco-office-chair-ergonomic-review-sit-weird"><h3>The HÅG Capisco Is A Great Chair For People Who Sit Weird</h3></a><p>The HÅG Capisco 8106 is an icon, but what you do in it almost isn't sitting.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Crossovers! Collabs! Whatever you want to call them, love them or hate them, in an age where the biggest companies only seem interested in serving you the same thing over and over again, we're stuck with them. This time around, it's a bit of an odd one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>-themed update sometime this summer. Why Terraria? Genuinely no idea, I suppose they might appeal to a similarish kind of crowd, outside of that I haven't the foggiest.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled "Tides of Terraria" (is it particularly ocean-themed? Why? Terraria isn't exactly an ocean-focused game), the update will apparently let you "catch, train, fight, and work monsters from Terraria just like Pals...?" I would have put a question mark at the end of that copy too, because the whole thing sounds a bit absurd, but I suppose it's better than just a Terraria-themed gun or whatever. Aside from being described as "large", there aren't any other details on the Terraria aspect of the update.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/pocketpair">Pocketpair</a> say that there'll be other new Pals to catch and islands to explore in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game's Terraria update, but again, no more than that. "The contents of the update will be announced across official Palworld social media channels over the next few weeks, so please follow!" they wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518587145533786079">Steam post</a> about the update.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't that long ago that Palworld received its last patch, which wasn't a particularly massive one. The thing it was noticeable for was technically removing a feature, specifically making it so that when you glide, instead of doing so with a Pal, you just do so with a regular, boring glider. In case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">this is because of Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, so you can thank Mario for this one.

Despite not being able to share any details about gameplay, Horii said, "I am making it, putting lots of work into it... I can only say that the next work will be great too, [I'm] working really hard." He also called for fans to remain excited for the future of the franchise: "Please look forward to it, is the only thing I can say." </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Quest 12: The Flames Of Fate - Official Title Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>With the game now very likely to launch after the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Horii was asked if there are any plans for the new console, especially considering the franchise's past commercial successes on the original Switch. Although Horii is vague in the interview about what Dragon Quest properties might come to the new system, he mentioned, "I believe it could be compatible with Switch 2 as well." </p><p>Most of the specifics we know about Dragon Quest XII come from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-the-flames-of-fate-announced/1100-6492022/" data-ref-id="1100-6492022">Horii's statements from around the time of its original announcement</a> four years ago. He shared that the game is meant to provide players more options and more choices with how to play, and that Square Enix will be significantly changing the franchise's command battle system. </p><p>While Dragon Quest XII may be a ways off, fans of the series still have something to look forward to this year: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon/1100-6530455/" data-ref-id="1100-6530455">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D preorders are now live</a> and will launch later in 2025. This remake follows up last year's release of Dragon Quest III HD-2D.</p>
