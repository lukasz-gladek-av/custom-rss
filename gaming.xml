            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As promised by <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, the new <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong> feature is now publicly available via an update released for the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced earlier this month at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> for a late January release, RTX Remix Logic enables modders to <strong>dynamically trigger graphics effects in direct response to real-time in-game events</strong>. Critically, it achieves this without requiring source code or engine access, which would otherwise make it a dealbreaker in most cases.</p>



<p>NVIDIA says there are <strong>over 30 in-game events</strong> that can be triggered, such as:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Event Category</th><th data-align="left">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Player state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Camera position, camera zoom, player world coordinates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>World bounding boxes</strong></td><td data-align="left">Indoor/outdoor detection, region-specific triggers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Object state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Any tracked object's position, visibility, and proximity to the player</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Time flow</strong></td><td data-align="left">In-game time of day, elapsed real-time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Input</strong></td><td data-align="left">Specific key presses by the player</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p> These triggers can manipulate <strong>over 900 RTX Remix graphics parameters</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighting conditions (time of day, color temperature, intensity)</li>



<li>Weather systems (rain, snow, fog density, volumetric effects)</li>



<li>Material properties (displacement, reflectivity, emissiveness)</li>



<li>Post-processing effects (chromatic aberration, bloom, vignette)</li>



<li>Path-traced volumetrics (smoke, atmospheric scattering)</li>
</ul>



<p>You won't even need to be a professional coder to add RTX Remix Logic to your mods. <strong>NVIDIA has introduced an accessible, no-code node-based interface</strong> where modders can easily drag-and-drop nodes representing triggers and actions, connect cause and effect relationships visually, fine-tune parameters with dedicated sliders and dropdowns, and finally preview all the changes they've made in real time within the Remix editor. More crafty RTX Remix modders will even be able to <strong>create and share custom event triggers</strong>, and new action nodes can be added via plugins, making the framework heavily extensible.</p>



<p>NVIDIA's demo was created in <strong>Half-Life 2 RTX</strong>, where RTX Remix Logic can trigger a '<strong>Ravenholm multiverse</strong>' whenever the player opens a specific door, as shown below. There are many RTX Remix mods in development (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reported a new one for <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong> just yesterday</a>); it will be interesting to see which modders decide to add this new system to their mod projects. According to NVIDIA, RTX Remix Logic can be added to <strong>over 165 classic PC games</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today, NVIDIA also shared a small update on new games that support its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) set of technologies. <strong>Half Sword</strong>, a physics-based medieval combat simulator scheduled to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will debut with built-in support for <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> with the option to upgrade <strong>Super Resolution</strong> to the second-generation <strong>DLSS 4.5</strong> transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong>, which is out now in advanced access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find our review here</a>), supports DLSS Super Resolution. The same goes for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released free-to-play PvP raid shooter <strong>Highguard</strong></a>, in which GeForce RTX owners can also upgrade Super Resolution to DLSS 4.5 via the app.</p>

            <p>Quick confession: every time I come up with an absolute Frankenstein’s cocktail of allusion-cobbling Google-bait like the headline for this article, a fairy dies. But that’s OK, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-express">Hell Express</a> is a top-down 3D extraction shooter about delivering letters to the dead. When I play it – there’s no release date yet – I will convey a note of apology to the soul of the fairy I’ve just slain with my appalling SEO practices. This may be difficult, however, because many of the underworld’s denizens are hostile. The only thing you’ll be delivering to them is bullets, fire and explosives.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Hell Express is a PvE isometric extraction shooter for 1-4 players, blending heart-pounding combat, high-risk treasure hunts, and strategic resource management in a world teetering between life and death,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564490/Hell_Express/">the Steam page</a>. “As a member of Hell Express—an armed delivery company that sends delivery to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>—you'll choose from a diverse cast of characters, each with unique abilities and personal motives. Dive into the perilous depths of Limbo, complete dangerous deliveries, and scavenge for treasures to upgrade your gear and vehicles. But beware: every decision could mean the difference between survival and ruin.”</p>

<p>Further down the page they call it a "road trip", with a "Hell Trakker" van you can equip with flamethrowers. There are glimpses of the extraction mechanics, too, with a squad of players holding the line against boglins while hauling somebody's KO'd ass to the van. Still, I think I prefer what I've seen of the stealthy interior stretches. I hope it scrubs up well as a solo play - I don't need any co-op partners trampling on my atmosphere of mounting trepidation. Go watch the van, why don't you.</p><p>Hell Express was announced last year, and developers Full Metal Bagel Games have just signed up with Arc Games as publisher. Arc Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-neverwinter-and-star-trek-online-devs-cryptic-allowing-them-to-gather-their-party-and-boldly-go-where-saber-went-before">used to be part of Embracer</a>, before Embracer fell into a giant, self-dug hole of layoffs and restructuring. They and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-online">Star Trek Online</a> developers Cryptic are now part of Project Golden Arc, an operation run by members of the Arc Games management team with funding from XD Inc. </p>
<p>As for Full Metal Bagel, they apparently include “industry veterans who’ve worked on highly acclaimed titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last of Us Part II</a>, Assassin’s Creed Origins, Honor of Kings, and more.” As ever with these things, it’s unclear whether “veterans” here means people whose contributions to those games were significant enough to imply anything substantial about the game they're making now.</p>
<p>A quick LinkedIn trawl reveals that Full Metal Bagel’s art director is Keyi Li, who was a senior concept artist at Ubisoft and Tencent. I do like the art direction of Hell Express. There’s an enticing balance of crisp military tech, convoluted and decayed layouts, and paranormal fixtures or interruptions. Did you see the queue of petrified people by the derelict bus in the announcement trailer? I thought that was one of the better queues of petrified people I’ve seen in a game – probably, one of my top three.</p>

<p>Look out for a Hell Express playtest this spring.

A fairy probably died for that headline, too.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-7-mini-pc-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-drops-to-its-lowest-price-and-is-selling-fast-as-a-mac-mini-alternative-2000663260</link>
            <guid>1417366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space is a luxury these days, especially for people working from home or studying in smaller apartments. A full-size tower PC can feel excessive when all you really need is reliable performance which you can get from something more compact. Mini PCs solve that problem neatly, and the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a strong example of how much power can fit into a surprisingly small box. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/">Right now, it’s also much cheaper than usual, thanks to Amazon discounts that shave as much as $240 off select configurations.</a></p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is its size. It’s compact enough to sit unobtrusively on a desk, tuck onto a shelf, or mount behind a monitor. It works for students, professionals, or really anyone building a clean, minimalist workspace.</p>
<p>ACEMAGIC is offering multiple configurations to suit different needs and budgets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p><strong>The entry-level option comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics</strong>. This setup is more than capable of handling everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and light creative work. It normally sells for $459, but the current discount drops the price to $329, marking a 28% savings.</p>

<p>Users who need extra power can step up to the higher-end model, which includes 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. This version runs on the AMD Ryzen 7 H 255 processor and is better suited for heavier multitasking, larger and more plentiful files, and more demanding applications. Its usual $759 price tag has been cut to $519, a 32% discount that brings premium specs into a far more approachable range. Storage expansion is also supported, with room to add an additional SSD for up to 4TB total capacity.</p>
<h2>Small Stature, Big Performance</h2>
<p>In daily use, performance feels snappy and responsive. The system handles office software, photo editing, and multitasking without slowing down, particularly in the 32GB configuration. Windows 11 Pro comes preinstalled, so setup is quick and straightforward right out of the box.</p>



<p>Display options are well supported. Using USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0, it can drive an 8K display at 60Hz. An HDMI port supports 4K at 60Hz. The three together means up to three monitors can be connected at once without any extra adapters.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 4.2 keep wireless connections fast and stable, while six USB 3.2 ports provide enough room for wired peripherals. Cooling is handled by dual centrifugal fans, a layered fin design, and a dedicated aluminum heatsink for the SSD, keeping noise and temperatures under control.</p>
<p>For anyone looking to reclaim desk space without giving up performance, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is worth a look—especially with current discounts pushing the top configuration down to just $519.</p>

He then sold this currency online for Bitcoin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Lakeman had no access to player accounts in his position at Jagex as a content developer, he allegedly accessed them by "hacking and/or using credentials of members of the account recovery team." In all, 68 players allegedly lost gold to Lakeman, starting around 2018.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here comes the science bit: the defendant's defence claimed that the in-game currency could not be classed as property under the definition of the UK's Theft Act, and initially, the court agreed, concluding that as RuneScape gold is not real — or "pure information" or "knowledge" as it's legally defined — it could not technically be stealable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judge at the time also deemed RuneScape's supply of Gold as being infinite, and it wasn't "rivalrous" given that having a piece of Gold doesn't deprive another player of getting Gold, too. The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed and last week handed down a <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>judgment</u></a> while explaining its reasoning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Judge Popplewell wrote. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite.' This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[RuneScape's gold is] properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language," the judgment added. "They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge:' functionally, they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judgment concluded: "On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a judgment that could have profound implications for the games industry, as up until now, vendors that sell (or re-sell) in-game currency have existed in a grey market wherein <em>technically,</em> no theft has occurred if the digital asset stolen did not meet the definition of an intangible item under the definitions of theft in that country. The dubious line of when ownership of any such in-game currency transfers from the developer to the player — if at all — further compounds an already complex issue, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the issue of whether removing gold from player accounts constituted theft now settled, the case against Lakeman can proceed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Monday, January 26th at 10am PST, we enter another dimension! Yayayaya.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That comment, which pointed to Highguard’s confirmed release date, came alongside an image of a supposed Highguard event badge, which some have speculated may have been generated by AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Highguard’s launch, questions were raised about the validity of Dr Disrespect’s post. Then, Wildlight Entertainment creator manager Chin Pua <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to confirm Dr Disrespect had not attended the event, and that the badge was not official. "I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present," Pua said, "and the badge was not an official badge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why did Dr Disrespect post the tweet and its image? In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jaHFgbgGqaw?si=tRaUr9hBxubnMqbL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stream playing Highguard yesterday</a>, he laughed the post off as a joke, and expressed disbelief at the social media controversy it had generated.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/gettyimages-1555295895-1769516265043.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dr Disrespect has said his Highguard tweet was a joke.

Did we say we went to the event? Did we say we got hands on? Did I say I was going to give you my review and feedback today? Huh? Did we say we were going to give our feedback and review today? ‘We got hands-on Highguard.’ Did I say that? Did we play the game? No. We just put together a photo poking fun. All these f***ing people took it seriously. Holy s**t. How brain dead is this f***ing industry? How stupid is this industry?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr Disrespect went on to hit out at his critics, defend his current brand, and insist he remains relevant. Dr Disrespect returned to YouTube in September 2024 three months after he was demonetized and suspended from the YouTube Partner Program following allegations regarding past conduct with a minor. Beahm has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highguard launched last night and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-launches-to-big-steam-concurrents-but-its-getting-absolutely-destroyed-in-user-reviews">met with big Steam concurrents but also a flood of negative user reviews</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its Q3 financial results for this fiscal year, and when it comes to consolidated results for the nine-month period as a whole, the studio is doing pretty well, as are some of its core franchises.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial presentation</a>, Capcom reveals that its sales, operating profit, and ordinary profit are all up by varying degrees when compared to March-December 2024, and the studio is on track for a better 2025-26 fiscal year as a whole, too.</p><p>When it comes to specific games, Capcom says the <em>Resident Evil </em>series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, "continued to grow" in sales terms, and that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>managed to surpass the 11 million sales mark within the March-December period as well.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has picked up another million sales for itself.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The new sales figure means <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another million sales since the end of March</a>, which rather validates Capcom's concern that sales slowed down dramatically after launch, although whether the so-called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"PS5 barrier" is to blame</a> is another matter.</p><p>Capcom also says that sales of the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake<em> </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>grew thanks to the announcement of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is due to arrive next month. Both games had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="649d13dc-948c-45a4-b39b-fbab7260a9b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million sales barrier</a> at last count.</p><p>With regards to Capcom's future, the company has a pretty packed slate. The aforementioned <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>leads the pack, but there's also <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 </em>and <em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection </em>to look forward to in March.</p><p>In total, Capcom sold 34.64 million game units between March and December 2025, which is around four million units higher than the previous year's total. It's fair to say Capcom is on the up right now.</p><figure role="group">

              <p>Most TVs don’t come with strong built-in speakers. If your entertainment setup is missing solid sound, and you often find yourself fiddling with the volume settings and rewinding scenes just to hear what was said, it might be time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>A soundbar can be an excellent investment, and you don’t have to break the bank to pick one up today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/">The Sony HT-S400 2.1ch soundbar bundle, which includes a wireless subwoofer, is currently going for $228 at Amazon, after an impressive 24% discount on its usual $300 price</a>. You’re saving $72 on an option that’s going to make movies and TV shows a lot more enjoyable by offering a truly immersive listening experience. This $228 price is also the lowest we have seen the soundbar go for in the last 30 days. Just note that the stock is already running low. We suggest placing your orders without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>Both the soundbar plus the subwoofer come in a minimal design, and are made to easily blend into any room. The soundbar features a flat back, so you can mount it on a wall for an even cleaner setup.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it’s got S-Force PRO Front Surround and Dolby Digital that come together to create a 3D, cinematic style surround sound that follows you. Audio won’t be blasted from a single place but instead, fill the room in a natural way. Think whispers coming from across the couch, laughter in the air, footsteps around the room – basically, the kind of immersive sound that makes you feel like a part of whatever’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>Then there’s the X-Balanced Speaker Unit and Separated Notch Edge, which deliver wide-ranging sound and enhanced vocal clarity for crisp dialogs. You won’t miss a word, whether the characters are mumbling to themselves or whispering a secret out. The included wireless subwoofer takes the experience even further. It has a large 160mm speaker unit to push deeper, richer bass that brings music to life. You’ll enjoy all the highs and lows exceptionally well. What’s more, there are multiple sound modes to choose from, including Sound Field, Voice Mode, and Night Mode. The Voice mode, for instance, offers clearer dialogs, while the night mode reduces the overall volume to avoid disturbing others around the house. So, just to recap – this system gets you better dialogs, richer bass, and an overall surround sound experience for all your favorite movies, TV shows, and tracks. That’s almost like bringing the cinema home!</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started couldn’t be easier. You can connect the system to your TV with either HDMI ARC or optical connection, or other devices via Bluetooth. The OLED display window on the sound bar keeps you in the loop about information such as input source, volume, and sound settings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/">There’s plenty more to like here, especially now that the soundbar, along with the subwoofer, can be yours for just $228</a>. It’s a rare drop on a highly-rated model, but it won’t last long. It’s best to grab it while the offer is still live to avoid paying full price later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994"><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i></a> <span>was one of the big surprises during last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Gamescom: Opening Night Live</span></a><span> showcase. Not only is it mechanically a pretty big departure from the usual fare of Traveller’s Tales’ </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games, but it also kind of seems like a follow-up to the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games that we’ve been lacking for over a decade. The game’s still a few months away, so let’s break down everything we know so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The obvious </b><b><i>Arkham </i></b><b>influence</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>draws heavily from Rocksteady’s </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games. Like those games, it takes place in an open-world Gotham with Bruce gliding and grappling around as he finds thugs to beat up and Riddler puzzles to solve. When he’s on the ground, the mini-figure Batman rides around on a motorcycle and in the Batmobile, and in combat, he throws almost rhythmic punches, kicks, and parries like he does in the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games. When I played the game in October, my muscle memory for those old games kicked in pretty quick. It’s QTE-driven, which means that if you’re on top of your blocks and dodges, you can pretty much dance your way through a fight without taking a hit.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>fans will also recognize a few of Batman’s tools, including the explosive gel that he uses to break through walls. Overall, it looks like Traveller’s Tales is stepping up in Rocksteady’s absence.</span></p> <h2><b>Playable characters</b></h2> <p><span>Like most </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games, </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>is a co-op game. One player will play as Batman, while the other can play as multiple characters from a rotating roster of partners. The ones we know of include Catwoman, Jim Gordon, Nightwing, Robin, and Talia al Ghul. Each of them will have a special ability, which will sometimes be necessary to progress through a level. Gordon, for example, has a foam gun which can be used to block obstacles in Batman’s way. If you don’t have someone to play with, you can swap between characters on the fly to use these abilities.</span></p>

 <h2><b>An homage to the many Batmen that came before</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>seems to pay tribute to multiple versions of Batman from movies, animation, and of course, comic books. Some notable cameos we’ve seen in the trailer include characters from the Christopher Nolan, Tim Burton, and Matt Reeves films, and no matter what version of </span><i><span>Batman</span></i><span> is your favorite, you’ll probably see it celebrated here. The idea is that you’ll be playing through a blocky version of Batman’s life, drawing from different iterations but telling the general story of how he went from sad orphan boy to sad orphan man who beats up people in dark alleyways. We’ll surely see cameos from different characters, such as the rest of the Bat Family, his butler Alfred, and maybe members of the Justice League and League of Assassins. Plus, we know we’ll see plenty of Batman’s iconic villains, such as the Joker, Bane, the Penguin, and Poison Ivy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Release date and system info</b></h2> <p><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S on May 29, with a Switch 2 version expected later in the year.</span></p>

			<p>If you are a fan of the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, you are well aware of how <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is <strong>struggling</strong> in more ways than one. Launched successfully in late February 2025, the game's <strong>low challenge level</strong> and <strong>performance issues</strong> prevented it from capitalizing on its launch momentum.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">Title Updates</a></strong> released last year <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">addressed the low challenge level</a></strong> of the experience, this wasn't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enough</strong> for many fans of the series, who <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returned to previous entries in the series</strong> such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter World</em> to get their hunting fix.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>producer Yuya Tokuda pleaded with lapsed players to return</strong></a>, but it seems the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation</strong> and the <strong>performance issues that still persist</strong> are not only keeping players away, but are <strong>deterring new ones</strong> as well.</p>



<p>Earlier today, CAPCOM shared <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf"><strong>a list of its best-selling games</strong></a> for the third quarter of the current fiscal year. While <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/"><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></a>,</em> and the <em>Resident Evil</em> series <strong>enjoyed strong sales</strong>, the same cannot be said of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>



<p>The latest entry in the series sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">354,000 units</strong> in the third quarter, as opposed to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">453,000 units of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> and the 431,000 units of its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sunbreak</em></a> expansion</strong>. This difference in units sold (which may have been helped by the deep discounts of the older games offered during the holiday period), and its status as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">publisher's worst-selling game in the quarter</strong>, further highlight the struggle <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is facing, and can't seem to overcome.</p>



<p><span><em>"Rise selling more than Wilds is pretty damning,"</em>&nbsp;commented <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-q3-fy2025-best-selling-games-re4-1-08m-re-village-717k-sf6-600k-re2-529k-mh-rise-453k-mh-wilds-354k.1417129/post-150569974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetERA forums member Gilo</a></strong>, a sentiment that describes well a&nbsp;<strong>baffling and unexpected situation,</strong>&nbsp;a</span>nd that reflects how the gaming community is reacting to <strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' low sales.</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bluetti-mini-portable-power-station-drops-below-black-friday-prices-now-an-affordable-emergency-backup-for-outages-2000663272</link>
            <guid>1417300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power stations make it easy to keep your important devices, as well as essential home appliances, running during outages and off-road trips. If you’re concerned about a winter storm affecting the electricity supply in your area, or just want a reliable backup power solution for your outdoor adventures, a power station can come in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">Now is a great time to pick up a portable option, as Amazon is offering the Bluetti Elite 10 mini at a 43% discount today.</a> You can pick it up for just $113, after saving a nice $86 on its retail price. This offer applies to both grey and meadow green versions of the power station. The only thing to note here is that the offer is only around for a limited time. We highly suggest grabbing it sooner rather than later if you want to avoid paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry</h2>
<p>This power station is truly portable. It fits in your palm, weighs just 4.0 lbs, and features an ergonomic handle that makes the thing incredibly easy to carry around. In fact, it fits within the size guidelines of most airlines, so you can take it with you on flights, too.</p>
<p>As for the power, the Elite 10 is a 128Wh option that’s equivalent to 4 regular power banks. You’re getting a 200W AC outlet, 100W USB-C fast charging, and multiple DC ports to keep multiple devices charged and running. The capacity is more than enough to charge your smartphone more than 6 times and juice a laptop to full twice. You can even power a mini fridge for around 1.8 times, or keep a projector running for a bit. It plays nicely with a wide range of devices, so whether it’s your tech essentials that need a boost or some emergency lights requiring power, it supports them all.</p>



<p>The Elite 10 mini includes a built-in light with three lighting modes with up to 50 hours of illumination, too. These include warm, cool, and SOS, which is handy in low-light situations and emergencies. You can control the power station right through your phone using the dedicated app. It lets you keep an eye on the charging situation, choose light modes, adjust input, and more.</p>
<p>When it comes to recharging the power station itself, you can power it back up in three ways. The first is 150W AC charging, which helps it hit 100% in just over an hour. The 100W solar charging (best to pair with Bluetti 60W/100W panels), and 100W car charging via cigarette lighter are supported too. What’s even better is that the Elite 10 mini comes with a built-in 10ms UPS and features 350W bypass output, which can keep gadgets running without interruption during outages.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Bluetti Elite 10 mini power station itself, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">You can pick this portable, easy-to-use, but powerful option for $113 at Amazon.</a> This is nothing considering the ease of mind and convenience this appliance brings. Be sure to get your orders in fast, as the deal can wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-out-original-airtags-as-airtag-2-arrives-prices-drop-to-an-all-time-low-2000663265</link>
            <guid>1417279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="542">Apple’s Find My app is one of those tools you don’t fully appreciate until the moment you really need it. It’s the safety net for those heart-stopping situations when you realize something important isn’t where it’s supposed to be. Leaving a phone behind at a restaurant, walking away from a laptop at a café, and looking down at your wrist to check the time and being met with a harsh tan line where you watch is supposed to be—all scenarios where Find My proves its worth. It doesn’t always deliver miracles, but even knowing where something last checked in can bring a surprising amount of relief.</p>
<p data-start="544" data-end="1001">The real magic of the Find My ecosystem shows up when you expand beyond Apple’s core devices. AirTags make it possible to track everyday items with the same confidence you’d have with an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. These small, lightweight discs can be attached to or inserted into nearly anything you own. Keys, wallets, backpacks, and even tech like handheld gaming consoles can all be added to your digital map with minimal effort.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="544" data-end="1001">Ease Your Mind When on the Move</h2>
<p data-start="1003" data-end="1401">Travel is where AirTags truly shine. Lost luggage is one of the most frustrating parts of flying, especially when airlines struggle to provide clear updates. Slipping an AirTag into a checked bag gives you a real-time view of where your belongings are, sometimes offering more accurate information than the airline itself. It may not mean you’ll get it back any sooner, but at least you can be confident whether your bag is at least in the same continent.</p>
<p data-start="1403" data-end="1776">For anyone considering adding AirTags to their setup, Amazon is making the decision easier right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">A four-pack that typically sells for $99 is currently discounted to $70 on Amazon. That’s a 29% price drop, bringing the cost down to roughly $17.50 per AirTag</a>. For an accessory that can protect hundreds or even thousands of dollars’ worth of gear, that’s really nothing at all.</p>


<p data-start="1778" data-end="2149">Setup is straightforward. Pairing an AirTag requires nothing more than bringing it close to your iPhone or iPad and following a brief on-screen prompt. Once connected, it appears in the Find My app alongside your other devices. Custom names can be assigned to each AirTag, making it easy to tell at a glance which one is attached to your keys, bag, purse, etc.</p>
<p data-start="2151" data-end="2480">Finding misplaced items around the house is another area where AirTags prove their usefulness. The built-in speaker can be activated through the Find My app, producing a clear sound that helps pinpoint items hiding under furniture or buried in clutter. That can save you a whole afternoon of turning your entire apartment upside down to find your car keys.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders-headwinds-update-what-are-they-how-to-get-them/</link>
            <guid>1417276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Headwinds update for ARC Raiders is finally here, and it’s brought with it a fair share of new content. From a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> to a new Minor Map Condition, it’s a fairly exciting update, but one thing has caught the fanbase off guard—the new Augments.</p>



<p>It wasn’t mentioned anywhere in the build-up to the update, but now that it’s here, two new Epic Augments have been confirmed to have arrived in ARC Raiders. Augments are crucial to planning your loadout, and by the looks of things, these two new ones are about to shift the meta in a major way.</p>







<p>Follow along with this guide to find out what the two new Epic Augments are in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-easily-complete-all-arc-raiders-trials-this-week-january-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as well as how to get your hands on them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-two-new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders">What Are The Two New Epic Augments In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will they be better than the Survivor Augment? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The two new Epic Augments in ARC Raiders are the Tactical Mk. 3 Revival and the Survivor Mk. 3 Safekeeper.</strong></p>



<p>Both Augments are of the Epic rarity, and they each bring some unique traits to the table. Here are both of their unique traits:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Augment Name</th><th data-align="center">Augment Trait</th><th data-align="center">Augment Shield Compatibility</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical Mk. 3 Revival</td><td data-align="center">Restores 1 health every 5 seconds. When damage is taken, the effect is paused for 30 seconds.<br>Augmented Slot has a Defib.</td><td data-align="center">Light</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Survivor Mk. 3 Safekeeper</td><td data-align="center">A Safe Pocket that allows any item to be stored.</td><td data-align="center">Light<br>Medium<br>Heavy</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The star of the show is undoubtedly the Safekeeper Augment; having the ability to store any item in your safe pocket, including guns, is a major benefit to any raider, and it’s immediately one of the best Augments in the game. The Revival Augment, on the other hand, is a slight let down. The integrated Defib is a nice touch, but based on the name, fans were hoping for a self-reviving augment.</p>



<p>Let’s be real, though—everyone is going to want that Safekeeper Augment. But the question remains, where do you find it?</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-two-new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders">Where To Find The Two New Epic Augments In ARC Raiders</h2>



<p><strong>As is the case with every other Augment in ARC Raiders, there’s no set spawn location to find them; instead, you’ll need to hope you find their Blueprint whilst looting.</strong></p>



<p>That’s not to say there aren’t places you can search to improve your odds of finding one, though. Your best bet is to load into a map during a Major Map Condition, like a Night Raid or Electromagnetic Storm. Once in, head to the High Loot zones, and get searching!</p>







<p>Some of the best containers are usually the Lockers and Cabinets, though Blueprints can be found just about anywhere. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-removes-out-of-map-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stella Montis</a> is a great map for such looting excursions, but beware, as most raiders are bound to be on the prowl for the same Blueprints—and they don’t always play nice.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a remarkably strong early access start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-boss-calls-early-release-the-most-challenging-but-rewarding-experience">despite a number of development hiccups</a> and it broadly not being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">that different to genre-leader Minecraft</a>, so it comes as no surprise modders are already hard at work on all sorts of additions and tweaks.</p>
<p>Last week, we were blown away by one modder who managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-modder-puts-minecraft-and-doom-inside-the-world-map">get Minecraft running inside Hytale's world map</a>. Now, we've come across another young developer who might have cracked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-style storms inside the new blocky sensation. User <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper">dattadeveloper</a> shared his creation via X/Twitter on 26th January:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Alongside the announcement, he also shared a link to <a href="https://builtbybit.com/resources/worldborder-api-included.91496/">download</a> his WorldBorder mod with an API. It's standalone and can be easily thrown into other projects. Border colours are fully customisable and it includes "multiple border shapes" as well as plenty of options to adjust it to each modder or player's needs. For something that's just come out, it's a very notable effort already.</p>
<p>The modder later shared <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014515716989014?s=20">other video examples</a> of WorldBorder in action and its possibilities. It's all impressive, and dattadeveloper appears to be ready to open the floodgates and start collaborating with other modders and event organisers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> veterans may remember how battle royale modes inspired by The Hunger Games popped off more than a decade ago, so we're getting a strong sensation of déjà vu here as Hytale positions itself as the minimal refresh the subgenre needed. Still, it'll take much more to dethrone Xbox and Mojang's behemoth, so we're curious to see how everything unfolds over the course of 2026.</p><p>For now, dattadeveloper <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014522025132531?s=20">is already experimenting</a> with his own take on Hunger Games-like modes, so it's just a matter of time before large community efforts around such competitive game modes begin to take shape thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-hytale-mods">Hytale mods</a> like this one.</p>

            <p>You're shuffling through the desert scrub, wondering if the clawed beasts just a few yards away have spotted you yet. You've made sure to pop a Stealth Boy just to be extra safe, and told Raul that if his knees creak at an inopportune moment, he's on his own. Then, you realise you brought Rex along, and he's gotten stuck on a rock several meters behind you. Finally freeing himself, the good boy bounds towards you at full speed. This should be the point in some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> stealthing that you realise it's brown trousers time.</p>
<p>It isn't, because Obsidian weren't total sadists when they designed the thing. It does take you out of your Mojave roleplay a bit, though. Thankfully, I can report that a modder has taken it upon themselves to ensure that New Vegas now benefits from the finest in sneaking dog technology.</p>

<p>The modder who's cracked the code to covert canines goes by Wombat, and has been doing <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/95967?tab=description">plenty of cool stuff</a> with New Vegas' animations as of late. Their '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96002?tab=description">Dog Sneak Animations</a>' does exactly what it says on the tin, adding in some extra movements which allow companions like Rex and Dogmeat to drop into a prone crawl whenever your character decides the time is right for stealthy crouch-walking.</p><p>Seriously, just look at Rex go in the video about, tail wagging just enough to betray how happy he is at the idea of pouncing on some unsuspecting raider. Are dogs actually this good at sneaking in real life? As a cat owner, I've got no idea, but if nothing else the animation's cute enough to distract you momentarily if you sneak yourself into a tight spot you're not going to be able to get out of.</p>
<p>The mod should also support modded dog companions, and judging by the comments could potentially be tweaked to include New Vegas' coyote-snake hybrid Nightstalkers, who'd certainly fit as sneaky slithering sidekicks. Wombat also notes that they've already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94901?tab=description">added to some sneak animations</a> to another non-human companion in the form of loveable robot ball ED-E. Though, there's no video preview for that one, so I can't tell you whether it causes the bot to grow limbs and start scrabbling around on his belly like the dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy creeping around with one of the Mojave's mutts, you'll need to grab a few other mods to get sneaking dogs working. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883">New Vegas Script Extender</a>'s up first, with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277?tab=description">JIP LN NVSE Plugin</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71336">kNVSE Animation Plugin</a> to follow, all of which are common New Vegas frameworks.</p>

            <guid>1417255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO has endured for a reason. It’s rare to find a brand that speaks just as clearly to kids exploring creativity and adults rediscovering it later in life. There’s something calming about opening a LEGO box, dropping out all the individual pieces across the carpet, sorting them out, and then getting started with the build. I personally like to pop on music or a podcast as I connect brick to brick, zoning out for a bit and enjoying the break from every day life for a moment.</p>
<p>Though putting together LEGO doesn’t have to be a lonely activity. It’s something you and your partner can do together, perhaps even as a Valentine’s Day date at home. And LEGO has the perfect set for the occasion. This art collectible set spells out in four letters, L-O-V-E to remind each other why you’re doing it. Show you love someone by gifting them this home decor LEGO set, then putting it together with them. It even happens to be one sale ahead of the special holiday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">Normally sold for $80, it’s now marked down 20%. That ends up shaving off $16, bringing the price to just $64 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Celebration of an Icon</h2>
<p>Now this isn’t just some design LEGO cooked up themselves. This is based on artist Robert Indiana’s iconic pop art. He first created it as a card back in 1964. Later in 1970, he adapted it into a 144-inch tall sculpture, now located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Since then, many different incarnations have been created, finding homes in cities including Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, but now potentially your living room too.</p>
<p>This 791-piece LEGO set is thankfully not as tall as the original. No, this one only measures in at a humble 10 inches tall by 10 inches wide, by 2.5 inches deep. It has the same vibrant red, blue and green colors. Just looking at pictures of this has me wondering when LEGO is going to make a set of the Nintendo 64 start-up screen logo. One day, hopefully.</p>



<h2>Build With a Loved One</h2>
<p>Really leaning into the Valentine’s Day theming of this set, it is even packed with two copies of the instructions, encouraging couples or duos of any kinds to work together on the build.</p>
<p>The set is even popular enough that a number of third party vendors on Amazon are selling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6895/">LED kits custom made to line up with the outer edge of each letter, turning your lovely LEGO set into a cute lamp.</a></p>

            <p>
French unions representing workers at Ubisoft have reportedly voted unanimously in favour of strike action following the company's recent dramatic "reset" and in response to a voluntary redundancy proposal that could see as many as 200 Paris HQ employees lose their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Last week, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">announced</a> a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", resulting in the cancellation of six games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">troubled Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as well as delays for seven other titles, the closure of its Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, and a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Ubisoft is proposing a voluntary round of redundancies as it seeks to further reduce operating costs. The move - which is being organised under the voluntary Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, wherein employees can collectively negotiate the mutually agreed termination of a permanent contract - could result in as many as 200 jobs cut at Ubisoft's Paris headquarters. That's reportedly around 18 percent of the company's Paris HQ workforce, said to number approximately 1100 employees in total.
</p>
<p>
"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives," a Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">confirmed in a statement provided to IGN</a>, "Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France."
</p><p>
"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."
</p>
<p>
In response to the companys's voluntary redundancy proposal, as per French financial publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a>, unions representing Ubisoft workers - specifically, Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses du jeu vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps écologique - have unanimously agreed to strike. The strike is due to run from 10th-12th February, and will reportedly see unions coordinating with their international counterparts in a bid to expand the scope of the action.
</p>
<p>
Following word of Ubisoft's latest "reset", the company's share price <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">plummeted 34 percent</a>, resulting in its lowest share price in 15 years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has arrived with a hefty patch for ARC Raiders update 1.13.0, introducing new features, updates, and bug fixes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders’ new mode, Solos vs Squads, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> before the official announcement when the Headwinds update trailer was accidentally posted early. Now, the latest patch introduces a new game mode, along with other additions such as a Trophy Display, Bird City, new quests, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-update-1-13-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Update 1.13.0?</h2>



<p>The ARC Raiders update 1.13.0 introduces a new matchmaking option called Solo vs. Squads, designed for highly skilled players seeking a greater challenge. If you are a solo raider above level 40, you can participate in the Solo vs. Squads option and take on groups of raiders by yourself. Additionally, a new project called Trophy Display requires players to hunt and gather parts from groups of ARC. Successfully completing this can reward players with Raider Tokens, a Howl emote, a guitar, and 300,000 Coins.</p>



<p>Next, we have the Bird City map condition: Buried City has experienced a surge of birds building nests in empty chimneys. Players can inspect these nests for new trinkets, and more bird traps and ziplines will be added to the map. Additionally, this patch introduces two new types of Epic Augments and seven new quests for players to try out.</p>



<p>Additionally, ARC Raiders update 1.13.0 also introduces an option to set parties to open, allowing friends to join your game even faster. Players can now use squad invites, allowing party members to invite others. Check out all the changes in the full patch notes below: </p>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes">All ARC Raiders Update 1.13.0 Patch Notes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Solo vs Squads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the “Solo vs Squad” toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Trophy Display</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new long-term project which requires players to hunt increasingly dangerous groups of ARC to submit their parts for rewards. Raiders will be able to build a new Display Case over 5 different steps (same as for the Candleberry Project) and each level will add a new item to the Display Case.</li>



<li>The rewards for completing each step include blueprints as well as Raider Tokens, and full completion also brings additional rewards including a Howl emote, a guitar and 300,000 Coins. There is currently no fixed end date and it will not be impacted by Expedition resets.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Bird City</strong>
<ul>
<li>Flocks of birds have moved into Buried City, building nests in the empty chimneys. We got some reports of them storing shiny trinkets inside so make sure to inspect them. This new permanent map condition will be applied to the Buried City map only which will cycle in and out of rotation weekly. There will be more bird traps and ziplines present on the map. Raiders can expect more combat in, on, or around the rooftops, including more flying ARC, and more players in proximity.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>New Items</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 new types of Epic Augments</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>7 New Quests</strong></li>
