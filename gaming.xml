<p dir="ltr">A lot has happened in the past decade for Rocket League. Within a month of launching in 2015, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-league-passes-5-million-downloads/1100-6429303/">the game passed over 5 million downloads</a>. Back then, Rocket League cost $20 to purchase, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rocket-league-goes-freetoplay-this-summer/1100-6479939/">it went free-to-play in Summer 2020</a>.

            <p>
Apple is appealing the €500m (£429m) fine it received from the European Union in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods, insisting the punitive measure is "far beyond what the law requires".
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-slapped-by-500m-eu-fine-for-app-store-practices-that-deter-alternative-payments-third-party-stores">European Union hit Apple with the fine</a> after accusing the company of violating its Digital Markets Act (DMA), a <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">piece of legislation</a> intended to ensure major tech platforms behave fairly and in a way that doesn't stifle competition. Specifically, the EU had taken issue with Apple's "anti-steering" practices, which restrict iOS app developers' ability to link to alternative purchase methods away from its own App Store, where it takes a 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
At the time the fine was announced, the European Commission (the EU's executive branch) said the restrictions Apple imposed on app developers meant they weren't able to "fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store", while customers were similarly unable to "benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers". Apple was then given 60 days to "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future", or it would face further fines.
</p>
<p>
Apple responded by claiming it was being "unfairly targeting" by the EU, and that the measures it was being asked to implement were "bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free." It also promised to appeal the fine.
</p>
<p>
And that appeal is now underway. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/07/apple-appeals-eu-fine-app-store">reported by The Guardian</a>, Apple called the €500m fine "unprecedented" in a statement announcing its appeal to the EU's general court today, insisting it goes "far beyond what the law requires." The company added its appeal will demonstrate the European Commission is "mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users." Apple reportedly also accused the commission of unlawfully expanding the definition of steering to include the ability for developers to promote offers inside an app, in addition to being able to link to an external website.
</p>
<p>
Apple (which also <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/ga/ip_24_1161">recieved a €2bn EU fine in March</a> for its "abusive" App Store rules) overhauled its App Store guidelines last month in a bid to curtail further action by the EU, introducing two new commission tiers for in-app purchases. At Tier 1, Apple will take a five percent commission, while only providing basic App Store features to developers, including app reviews and privacy labels. The likes of automatic app updates and automatic app downloads are not included. Tier 2, meanwhile, is the default tier and offers access to all App Store services for a 13 percent commission on in-app purchases.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, from 1st January next year, Apple is introducing a new Core Technology Commission of five percent on all digital goods and services sold on the App Store and alternative marketplaces. This replaces the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">earlier, controversial Core Technology Fee</a>, which the EU also criticised in March, saying it "disinsentivised" App Store developers from using alternative app distribution channels and "failed to comply" with Apple's obligations.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, European Commission tech boss Henna Virkkunen said the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-tech-tariffs-us-brussels-trade-commissioner-maros-sefovic/">EU wasn't prepared to negotiate on the rules</a> outlined in its Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and AI Act, despite pushback from the Trump administration and US tech companies.

That said, shoutout to the current 5th place record holder for using Wiggler.</p><hr><h2 id="h1977"><a id="2"></a>Flower Cup</h2><p><strong>Desert Hills: Bowser</strong>’s super heavy stats dominate here. The Reel Racer will help you contend with the sandy terrain.</p><p><strong>Shy Guy Bazaar: </strong>Lightweights reign supreme through these winding tight corridors, with most record holders opting for <strong>Baby Mario</strong>. The Baby Blooper kart is popular here.</p><p><strong>Wario Stadium: </strong>Another showcase for lightweight characters, with <strong>Baby Daisy </strong>being the popular pick here. That said, the Reel Racer is currently a popular pick here too.</p><p><strong>Airship Fortress: </strong>Not to sound like a broken record, but lightweight characters once again win out here. <strong>Baby Mario </strong>dominates on bikes like the Mach Rocket, though Goomba is a surprisingly competitive pick here too.</p><hr><h2 id="h1978"><a id="3"></a>Star Cup</h2><p><strong>DK Pass: </strong>Super lightweights once again reign supreme here, but interesting enough, the dominant character here is <strong>Para-Biddybud</strong>. Baby Daisy also works here, and bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G fare well on these snowy peaks.</p><p><strong>Starview Pea: </strong>It’s another peak, but a different optimal character. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552"><strong>Bowser</strong></a></span><strong> </strong>on the Reel Racer occupies nearly every fastest time recorded here.</p><p><strong>Sky-High Sundae: Wario </strong>is your go-to if you’re doing laps around these treats. The Baby Blooper vehicle is most popular here.</p><p><strong>Wario Shipyard: </strong>Despite the aquatic terrain, <strong>Bowser </strong>on the Reel Racer is the popular choice here once again.</p><h2 id="h1979"><a id="4"></a>Shell Cup</h2><p><strong>Koopa Troopa Beach: </strong>Koopa Troopa Beach? More like King Koopa Troopa Beach, because <strong>Bowser </strong>holds all the fastest times here. Interestingly enough, trucks like the Chargin’ Truck perform well.</p><p><strong>Faraway Oasis: </strong>Funny enough, this course doesn’t have a clear “best” combo. The current record holder uses <strong>Penguin </strong>atop the W-Twin Chopper bike, but Bowser, Mario, and even Birdo are all used in close runner-up rankings.</p><p><strong>Crown City: </strong>Yes, this is the second time Crown City has appeared in a cup. To refresh your memory, <strong>Wario</strong> in the Hot Rod is the top pick.</p><p><strong>Peach Stadium: </strong>Current record holders predominately use <strong>Wiggler</strong>, typically paired with the Big Horn truck.</p><hr><h2 id="h1980"><a id=""></a></h2><h2 id="h1981"><a id="5"></a>Banana Cup</h2><p><strong>Peach Beach: </strong>Peach Beach, similar to the Koopa Troopa Beach, favors <strong>Bowser</strong>.

However, all of them have used the Reel Racer to get there.</p><p><strong>Dino Dino Jungle: </strong>Now please hold your excitement, because I know how widely beloved this racer is, but <strong>Cow </strong>is the top pick for this course. What’s more, the best racers use the Li’l Dumpy truck here too. There couldn’t be a more deserving combo to succeed.</p><p><strong>Great ? Block Ruins: </strong>As you might expect from a track with so many tight corners, the super lightweights reign supreme. The likes of Para-Biddybud and Baby Daisy have achieved the fastest times, all while using relatively balanced bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G.</p><hr><h2 id="h1982"><a id="6"></a>Leaf Cup</h2><p><strong>Cheep Cheep Falls; </strong>It’s lightweight time again, except we’re not going for the lightest of the light characters this time around. <strong>Nabbit </strong>currently rules the falls while using the Reel Racer.</p><p><strong>Dandelion Depths: </strong>The heavyweights will plunge you furthest into the depths, as <strong>Wario </strong>using the Reel Racer is the dominant pick.</p><p><strong>Boo Cinema: </strong>In a huge change of pace, the best racer on Boo Cinema is none other than King-... nah I’m just playing, <strong>Wario</strong> using the Baby Blooper has all the top times here.</p><p><strong>Dry Bones Burnout: Wario </strong>and the Baby Blooper. Everywhere I go I see his face.</p><hr><h2 id="h1983"><a id="7"></a>Lightning Cup</h2><p><strong>Moo Moo Meadows: </strong>No fakeouts this time: <strong>Cow </strong>very appropriately is the top pick for Moo Moo Meadows. Surprisingly, the top vehicle choice here is the Dread Sled. I couldn’t think of a less appropriate kart to drive around a farm, let alone at top speed, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745">let’s not apply logic to the Nintendo universe</a></span>.</p><p><strong>Choco Mountain: Bowser </strong>with the Reel Racer chews through this mountain the fastest.</p><p><strong>Toad’s Factory: </strong>Interestingly, the top times for this track are a tossup between our usual heavyweight champions: <strong>Wario </strong>and <strong>Bowser</strong>. That said, both of them use the Baby Blooper kart.</p><p><strong>Bowser’s Castle: </strong>This fearsome fiery world is a rare track where characters of all weight classes are in close contention. <strong>Wiggler </strong>does have the top spot, though.

As you’d expect, <strong>Wiggler</strong> with the Big Horn still succeeds.</p><p><strong>Rainbow Road: </strong>Last but <em>certainly </em>not least, we have the majestic rainbow road. <strong>Wiggler</strong> is the king here, either using the Billdozer or the ever reliable Reel Racer.</p><hr><p>Those are all the tracks in <em>Mario Kart World</em>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Karlach's greatest, rage-filled monologue is "the core of her" according to Samantha Béart.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan-favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> character Karlach is almost universally beloved for a number of reasons — chief among them, her cheery, sweet, and playful personality. But according to her voice actor Samantha Béart, that upbeat exterior belies something far, far darker, shaped by time spent in the bowels of Hell itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/samantha-beart-interview-karlach-baldurs-gate-3/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Gamer</a>, Béart spoke about their time playing Karlach, including the recording process and some very specific plot points. Béart specifically goes in deep on one of Karlach's late-game monologues, delivered after a character who has essentially ruined Karlach's entire life and future is finally dealt with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>Spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3 lie ahead. Read on at your own risk.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played Baldur's Gate 3 and seen Karlach's story through know where this is going. Karlach is a tiefling who, prior to the events of the game, has spent a decade in Hell thanks to a fellow named Gortash, who sold her to an archdevil and replaced her heart with what amounts to a bomb that will eventually, inevitably kill her sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That time in hell will really mess with a person, Béart says. So while most of the player's interactions with Karlach are jovial, that's Karlach making a choice to become someone better — it's not who she's always been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, [Karlach's story is] a redemption arc,” Béart said. “I think she was a piece of work in hell. She would have had to be [...] It was life in prison. That's where I was in my head with that, because otherwise, it's quite hard to relate it to something realistic. You just think about how people behave in those very small communities. Essentially, I think you can completely change to survive.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the player finally slays Gortash, Béart as Karlach delivers an incredible monologue unleashing all the pent-up rage, sorrow, and fear that Karlach has felt from spending all that time in Hell and facing her own inevitable demise. It's a really fantastic scene, and according to Béart, that monologue is at the center of who Karlach is:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's the core of her. That's the bit of her she's been hiding until she can't anymore,” Béart explained. “It's a piece I auditioned with, so I always knew it was coming. When it did happen, all the gates were off. All the ugliness can come out. It was a very satisfying and cathartic experience to film."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Béart added that this side of Karlach is absolutely something they discussed with Larian during recording, so even during Karlach's most upbeat moments, that undercurrent of pain still exists, which is perhaps why Béart's performance throughout is so effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, it's in no small part thanks to performances like Béart's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">we gave Baldur's Gate 3 a 10/10</a>. "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs," we wrote. Sadly, Larian recently said goodbye to active development on the game with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">final major patch in April</a>, as the studio moves onto new projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 1 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157168/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat</a> series is one of the company's most enduring hits, and has been a solid part of its lineup for decades, selling over 20 million units in the process – yet the origins of the franchise are somewhat murky and certainly not as well known as, say, the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/guides/best-ridge-racer-games-of-all-time-ranked-by-you">Ridge Racer</a> lineage.</p>
<p>This is somewhat ironic, as Ace Combat began life in the same fiery, amusement arcade cauldron as its car-based cousin – in fact, the very first instalment arrived in the same year that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Ridge Racer</a> was born: 1993. However, <strong>Air Combat</strong> was powered by Namco's System 21 polygonal arcade board, which wasn't capable of texture mapping; it would fall to its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-air-combat-22">Air Combat 22</a>, to deliver an experience that offered more graphical impact. That's the game which is now part of Hamter's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Air Combat 22 used Namco's more powerful System 22 hardware, the same board which made the jaw-dropping visuals of Ridge Racer possible. The end result is a fascinating (if shallow) <strong>Top Gun</strong> simulator which laid the foundations of the Ace Combat franchise.</p>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 2 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157179/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Air Combat 22 puts you in the cockpit of one of three planes — the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, Sukhoi Su-27 and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor (all of them perform exactly the same) — and presents you with three game modes: Cadet, Topgun and Dogfight.</p>
<p>The Cadet mode is playable with or without a tutorial (the latter offers two branching pathways), and guides you through the basics of aerial combat, while Topgun is a far sterner challenge, giving three potential routes to the end and a far wider selection of objectives. Dogfight, meanwhile, places you in several one-on-one duels with the aim of surviving for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Your weapons are a Vulcan machine gun (with infinite ammo) and lock-on missiles (with finite ammo). Using the latter requires you to have a solid lock on your target (the missile literally won't fire until you do), but even then, you might not score a hit, as some enemy planes are capable of releasing countermeasures.</p>
<figure><a title="Arcade Archives 2 Air Combat 22 Review - Screenshot 3 of 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157181/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking down enemies with the Vulcan bags you more points, but you need to get in closer to use it effectively. It's possible to accelerate and decelerate using the 'ZL' and 'ZR' buttons respectively, so you have quite a significant degree of control over your aircraft, despite this not being a 'serious' flight sim – something that would transition neatly into the console versions of Ace Combat which were spawned from this game and its 1993 forerunner.</p>
<p>Visually and sonically, Air Combat 22 certainly <em>feels</em> like a game from 1995, and arguably lacks the same impact as Ridge Racer does, even on modern eyes. Still, it runs at a smooth 60fps and controls really well, and it's certainly possible to spot the DNA of the franchise when compared to later entries. As such, fans of Ace Combat will find a lot to like here, even if it's rather basic in comparison.</p>
<p>Like Ridge Racer, Air Combat 22 is limited by the fact that it's very much designed as an arcade experience rather than a home console one, and expert players will see pretty much all there is to see in the space of a day or two. Unlike Ridge Racer, however, there's less reason to return as you don't have the appeal of shaving seconds of lap times, although there is an undeniable attraction to increasing your score and bettering your performance in the Dogfight mode.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Air Combat 22 is arguably more interesting as a historical artefact than it is as a video game, but that's not to say fans of Namco's series won't extract plenty of enjoyment from it. Like stablemate Ridge Racer, it's a very limited experience designed around short-burst 'arcade' play, but it's still entertaining enough to be worth your time and money; hopefully, it sells well enough for Bandai Namco and Hamster to bring other classic 1990s arcade titles to modern systems.</p></section>

They were nice side dishes but no grilled steak. Everyone appreciates a good potato salad or baked mac, but that’s not why they show up to the BBQ. It has been this way with Xbox for over a decade now. </p><p>There’s no shortage of great games but few are exclusive and none of them—not <em>Forza</em>, not <em>Halo</em>, not <em>Starfield</em>—have popped like the biggest exclusive blockbusters on PS5. Unable to conjure a killer app, it’s tried to buy them, starting with <em>Minecraft</em>, but the result is now that the most compelling parts of Microsoft’s portfolio are all available elsewhere.</p><p>If a family member, friend, or some stranger at GameStop asked me if they should get an Xbox, my answer would look like a spreadsheet full of if/then functions. The value proposition of Game Pass remains strong but increasingly mired in asterisks. Genre diversity abounds and there’s early console access to some of the biggest Steam hits around. There is something for everyone on Xbox if they know how, where, and when to look. My answer for whether to get a PS5 would be much simpler: <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>,<em> God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2, </em>a dozen remasters of <em>The Last Of Us</em>. </p><p>These are not the types of games everyone buys a $500 machine for, but they are definitely the types of games a particular kind of person might buy a $500 machine for. The type of person who buys relatively few games—a yearly <em>Madden</em> update and the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>—but doesn’t really discriminate between genres and has no franchise loyalty. They want the big, cinematic blockbuster with a gameplay hook just meaty enough to be fun but not so complex it starts to feel like work. These are the types of games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/unlocking-the-cheat-codes-to-geoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often win Game of the Year at Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards</a></span>, and they just happen to be the type Sony spent the PS4 generation specializing in. </p><figure id="" data-id="23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-recommend-id="image://23ed8e3a39523204422d2930f994124a" data-format="png" data-width="1269" data-height="706" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Phil Spencer appears on stage at E3 2018.

A new <em>Fable</em>, first revealed before the Xbox Series X/S launched, remains a year out.</p><p>The Xbox 360 surged to prominence thanks in part to Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> and Epic Games’ <em>Gears of War</em>. Neither franchise has been the same under Microsoft’s in-house teams. That might be part of why the company keeps acquiring new ones rather than trying to build them itself. But the results have been just as uneven. “If that were the only reason for this wave of cancellations and layoffs, it would be a terrible shame, but a rational reality,” <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a></span>. “But the darker cloud hanging over the story is that Microsoft has—consistently and repeatedly, over decades—shown it has no aptitude for running the creative industry it just bought half of.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">A year before he began laying off thousands of staff</a></span> across Xbox’s now-sprawling empire of studios and publishers, Phil Spencer suggested Xbox’s fate was set in stone. The Xbox One generation was too disastrous to recover from. Players were now locked in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446">He called it “[the] worst generation to lose.”</a></span> That logic paved the way for Microsoft’s pivot away from hardware and toward becoming a third-party publishing platform hitched to subscription and cloud gaming. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he said in 2023.  “That’s not going to happen.” But <em>Starfield</em> wasn’t an 11/10 or even a 9/10, so we’ll never quite know. It was a convenient time for the quality of exclusives to stop mattering. </p><p>Having watched the Switch cruise to being the second best-selling console of all time purely on the back of first-party exclusives like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I’m not convinced that the games don’t matter.

If you stop, they definitely won’t. </p><p>“I’m proud to introduce the creation of a brand new Microsoft studio, The Initiative, led by Darrell Gallagher, a visionary storyteller who has worked across some of the most iconic franchises for over 20 years,” Spencer said back at E3 2018. “This new Santa Monica studio is building a team of world-class talent to create groundbreaking new game experiences.” It was a play for GOTY blockbusters right in PlayStation’s first-party backyard. The Initiative would have “the resources, the platform, and the creative independence to take bigger risks and create  even bolder worlds.” Apparently the risks were too big and the worlds were taking too long. <br></p><p><em>Correction 7/7/2025 3:04 p.m.: </em>Psychonauts 2<em> came day-and-date to PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732]]></content:encoded>

I’ve only seen it offer one unconnected track at most among the listed choices. Picking Random in an online lobby <em>before</em> the recent update always resulted in a three-lap experience. After the update went live, picking Random now incorporates the chances of getting a connecting track from your current location. We don’t know what the odds are for anything, but most people are seeing the intermission tracks a lot more often.</p><p>I’m of the mindset that the function was likely bugged before. Choosing “Random” to limit the choices down to specifically closed-lap races doesn’t sound right when you think about it. This might be a case of something being fixed at the expense of being less fun. Then again, this game gives you vague settings labeled “Connected” and “Open” so who can say how the hell any of this is meant to work. <strong>For now, your safest bet for racing some simple laps online is to select an unconnected track whenever it’s a choice.</strong> If you don’t like the track or maybe don’t even get an unconnected option, go with random and pray for the best.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Villain Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Here’s hoping that <em>Mario Kart World</em> is updated in the future to make this easier and not more difficult…again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The question of Game Pass profitability has been debated within the games industry ever since the debut of Microsoft's subscription service in June 2017. The way many saw it, Microsoft could use its near-endless pockets to subsidize the service for a while, but not forever. At some point, Game Pass had to become profitable on its own.</p>



<p>Over time, Microsoft has always maintained that Game Pass was indeed profitable and sustainable. In December 2019, Phil Spencer, head of the gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-on-xbox-game-pass-sustainability-its-doing-very-well-for-us-and-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>The only concern I ever see is people saying, "Is it sustainable? Can you continue this?" I'll say, Xbox Game Pass right now is doing very well for us and the people who are in it, and it's something … I think it's going to be really interesting, as Xbox launches next year, and it will be an interesting thing as people think about, "Wait a minute, I already have this library of games on this platform." We've never had a console that's launched with a library of games that people are going to have available day one.</em></p>



<p>However, between the slow growth of the subscriber base and the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio closures and layoffs</a>, Game Pass is once again under fire by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developers</a> alike who believe that Microsoft may have bet on the wrong horse and that ultimately, it won't be sustainable in the long run.</p>



<p>Now, Chris Dring, former GamesIndustry.biz Editor in Chief and now co-founder of The Game Business, has shared some important details on how Microsoft is allegedly calculating the profitability of the subscription service. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>So costs associated with the Game Pass business is fees paid to third-parties, marketing, service costs… and by that measure, it’s profitable. What they don’t count is the lost revenue that Xbox’s first-party studios are seeing as a result of the service. I have to imagine if first-party studios received similar compensation, that profitability might not be correct. </em></p>



<p>Dring later clarified that he explicitly asked for clarification and was told that first-party costs were not included. Needless to say, that changes a lot, especially now that Xbox first-party studios include not only the likes of The Coalition, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries), et cetera, but also Bethesda and Activision Blizzard, two large publishers that own some of gaming's most prized intellectual properties. There's inevitably going to be some lost revenue by putting the likes of Call of Duty, Diablo, and DOOM on a subscription service like Game Pass from day one. How long Microsoft can afford to keep doing that remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bigger, more powerful Switch means bigger, more intensive games that take more time and money to make. But as development costs skyrocket across the industry, Nintendo seems to have a plan to keep things in control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">as it transitions into the Switch 2 era</a>.</p><p>In response to a question during <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">a recent shareholders meeting</a> about the increased costs of making games for its new console, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa admitted that “recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.”</p><p>However, he said that Nintendo’s development teams are “currently devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.”</p><div><p>“The game business has always been a high-risk business.”</p></div><div><p>The early lineup of first-party Switch 2 games has already shown Nintendo being more ambitious with its franchises on the enhanced hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em> introduced an open-world structure to the long-running racing series</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/694183/donkey-kong-bananza-preview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>adds an impressive destructive element to a more traditional 3D platforming experience</a>. This has come with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">increased costs for consumers</a>; <em>World</em> sells for $79.99, $10 more than most Nintendo games, while the Switch 2 itself is $449.99, a $100 jump over the Switch OLED. (In response to a question about these prices making it harder to reach younger audiences, Furukawa said that Nintendo is “closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system might become a barrier.”)</p></div><p>Of course, Nintendo is not alone, and the increased scale of game development has been disastrous for many of its competitors. Just last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">Microsoft’s gaming division was hit hard by layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while high-profile games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675923/black-panther-cancelled-cliffhanger-studios-shut-down-ea">Black Panther</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Concord</a></em> have been shut down alongside their development studios. Nintendo has been one of the rare exceptions in the floundering game industry, but keeping that up will become increasingly challenging as games get bigger. Then again, Furukawa offered one concrete way of combating this: more smaller games.</p><p>“We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty,” Furukawa said. “We see this as one potential solution to the concern aboutrising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within thecompany.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/699429/nintendo-switch-2-game-development-costs]]></content:encoded>

Sure, before that, Duke had starred in some genuinely good games in the ‘90s, like <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>. Since then, the famous (?) character has mostly stayed dormant. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/VIZ4v5_j6aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He did appear in a digital pinball table in 2023</a></span>.) But he’s finally back. Not in a new game, oh no, but instead as a sad crossover character in a free-to-play game featuring tanks. </p><p>Over the weekend, <em>World of Tanks</em> announced that Duke Nukem was going to be part of the game’s latest battle pass. They did so with a reveal trailer that harkens back to<em> Duke Nukem 3D</em>. It also features John St. John voicing Duke once more, a role he’s had since 1996. But this time, John barely sounds interested in what he’s reading. It’s the same lines again. At one point, Duke Nukem shouts “Shake it, baby!” at a tank. Mr. Nukem, are you okay? </p><p>Anyway, the new Battle Pass Special: Heroes’ Paths event starts on July 10 in <em>World of Tanks</em> and runs until July 21. Actual video game icon Lara Croft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/4vpDPWJ9iRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also part of the new pass</a></span>. Maybe one day her new game from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games-1849898949">Amazon will actually launch</a></span>? </p><p>Neither character makes a physical appearance in the game, as <em>World of Tanks</em> is about giant tanks fighting each other. So don’t expect Duke Nukem running around killing pig cops. Instead, the devs have picked two real-world tanks and modified them to better reflect Duke and Lara. Here’s how the developers describe Duke’s tank:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[Duke’s tank is] the <strong>TS-6</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. A powerhouse of destruction, this tank mirrors Duke’s “all guns blazing” approach. It boasts a custom nuclear reactor, enhanced weapon systems, and aesthetic nods to Duke’s arsenal, including laser machine guns and grenade launchers. The tank’s design draws inspiration from classic Duke Nukem weapons such as the incinerator and fire extinguisher.</p></blockquote><p>No pricing information was included in the press release I received. The Heroes’ Paths battle pass is split into two chapters. One will provide 30 stages for Lara Croft, and the other will feature 40 stages for Duke Nukem. You’ll be able to unlock various cosmetics inspired by each character and their franchises. Hopefully, one of those is a good <em>Duke Nukem</em> game.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-world-of-tanks-battle-pass-lara-croft-sad-1851785719]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Just days after its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/">Game Pass release</a>, Activision has taken the PC version of Call of Duty: WWII offline. The publisher didn't provide specific details on the issue, but the game's removal comes shortly after severe hacking claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players are pretty familiar with hacking situations in multiplayer and Warzone, but the ones seemingly plaguing the 2017 World War II shooter weren't the average variety of aimbots or wall hackers. The hacks reportedly being used in Call of Duty: WWII were RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks, meaning players were losing control of their PCs through a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">Some Call of Duty players posted clips on social media to spread awareness on the hacking issue before the game was pulled, showing their PCs being hacked while playing WWII. One of the viral clips from the weekend comes from "<a href="https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053" rel="nofollow ">Wrioh</a>," who shows an apparent RCE attack during a multiplayer match.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: WWII<br>Call of Duty: WWII on PC Microsoft Store was brought offline while we investigate reports of an issue</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Activision didn't acknowledge these security risks with the game, and it instead made a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a> on July 4 to simply announce Call of Duty: WWII was brought offline on PC while it investigates reports of "an issue." There's also no mention of when the game will return to PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there are still plenty of Call of Duty games available to play. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both feature the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-adds-beavis-and-butt-head-and-cel-shaded-maps/2900-6709/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> content, which includes new game modes, cel-shaded map variants, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head limited-time event</a>.

            <p>Fans eager to hear more about the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> are still being kept rather in the dark, with Lara Croft popping up in a number of other game collaborations instead of her own standalone adventure.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> wrapped back in 2018, Lara has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Netflix's animated series</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.brawlhalla.com/news/lara-croft-joins-brawlhalla-patch-3-57">Brawlhalla</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-lara-croft-mixes-classic-and-reboot-tomb-raider-designs">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-coming-to-in-magic-the-gathering-as-a-mechanically-unique-card">Magic the Gathering</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-tumbles-into-fall-guys-with-tomb-raider-crossover">Fall Guys</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLFpqOJIdTN/?igsh=a3U0NHFzNDR1dW4x">Pinball FX</a>, and now even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> as a part of a themed Battle Pass chapter. She's <a href="https://worldoftanks.eu/en/news/general-news/battle-pass-special-july-2025/">again being voiced by Keeley Hawes here</a>, in my opinion the best Lara.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lBQNNFi1AQ">new trailer for World of Tanks</a>, which you can see below, does give Tomb Raider fans like myself another look at Lara's unified design. As a reminder, the Tomb Raider team has said it will be uniting the original Tomb Raider games with the recent 'Survivor' trilogy reboots - which began in 2013 - in its next mainline game.</p>

<p>Lara's look in World of Tanks reflects this unification. Her style in the latest Tomb Raider collaboration takes most of its inspiration from the 'Classic Lara' look of old, with her tank top and braid taking pride of place, but she also has her jade necklace from the last three mainline games.</p>
<p>As well as Lara, Jonah from the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is featured, as is - somewhat to my surprise - Amanda Evert. Amanda first cropped up in Tomb Raider Legend as a former friend turned antagonist of Lara's. Her look in World of Tanks is perhaps most different from her original design, with the goth aesthetic toned down quite significantly. Personally, I have questions about why she is there at all, given her timeline is the Legend Timeline, which is the second game timeline in the Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>But this question aside, as a fan of Tomb Raider <em>games</em> rather than Tomb Raider collaborations, I really do wish we were being fed more than just Lara Croft in other franchises. I understand the need to keep the character relevant, but at this rate Lara is at risk of being featured more in games that aren't Tomb Raider than games that are. Truth be told, I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the comparative silence around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-announces-next-tomb-raider-game-made-in-unreal-engine-5">the next mainline Tomb Raider game</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, Amazon said it would provide its "full support" to Crystal Dynamics, as it works on "the biggest, most expansive" series entry to date. Then, in August last year, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development on the upcoming Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon was "going well"</a>. Since then, however, developer Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">has been subject to layoffs</a>, and nothing more has been officially said of the next Tomb Raider entry for some time.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Embracer alluded to a AAA release on its docket, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-plans-to-release-76-different-games-in-the-next-year-despite-previous-layoffs-and-studio-closures">the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish"</a>. Therefore, this particular game will likely release the following fiscal year. While Embracer did not specify which game under its umbrella it was talking about, I suspect it was Tomb Raider.</p>
<p>I really hope the Tomb Raider series can continue on successfully without the need to pimp Lara out to other franchises every couple of months. But right now, I am not too sure.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-is-popping-up-everywhere-except-in-a-new-tomb-raider-game]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Wild Sheep Studio has announced a new exploration title called Adorable Adventures, and it is a game where players play as Boris the baby boar who is looking for his family. The events take place in the aftermath of a forest fire, and Boris has to use his nose to sniff out his family across a forest, highlands, and caves where all sorts of activities await.</p>
<p><iframe title="Adorable Adventures - Announce trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/es_AnXYMiA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of Adorable Adventures is told by a forest guard, who narrates the events and the things Boris does. The game is about having a good time and exploring the forest while interacting with its elements. As the game progresses, Boris will be able to interact with various wildlife, complete a herbarium, and take part in some light hearted activities. Adorable Adventures is coming to PC and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840230/Adorable_Adventures/">can be wishlisted on Steam now.&nbsp;</a></p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon GO 9th Anniversary Artwork" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a6c5290aa667a/pokemon-go-9th-anniversary-artwork.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Can you believe that the mobile AR game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> is nine years old? We can't; it only feels like yesterday we started taking our phones with us for 'mon-catching trips.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1941995623567290393">GO X account</a> shared some brand new artwork to celebrate the 9th anniversary, and it seems to include a couple of hints on what we can expect to see in the coming months.</p>
<p>The artwork, from Pokémon GO's character designer Yusuke Kozaki, has a couple of small hints, but the big one is Paradox Pokémon, a new type of Pocket Monster introduced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2sj2iQyBTQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed390852xkuvtw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>These are usually past or future-versions of Pokémon, and in the artwork you can see Great Tusk and Iron Treads, the Ancient and Future version of Donphan.</p>

<p>A more vague teaser in the artwork comes from the character with the thumbs-up icon in front of the Metagross; some think this could be hinting at remote trading, while others think its related to emotes. It could mean nothing, of course, but it's more likely a little teaser.</p>
<p>Zygarde's 50% form could be hinting at a new event based on the 'mon — a logical conclusion given that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> seems to be focusing on Order Pokémon, and that's out this October. Gigantamax Butterfree also features, who is yet to appear in Pokémon GO. Our guess is we'll hear more about this during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-next-pokemon-presents-is-coming-in-july">Pokémon Presents later this month</a>.</p>
<p>The game has been making headlines throughout the year following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/niantic-sells-pokemon-go-and-entire-gaming-division-for-usd3-5-billion">Niantic Spatial's decision to sell off its entire gaming division</a> to publisher Scopely — which is part of Savvy Games Group and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund — for $3.5 billion earlier this year.</p>
<p>Since then, the team behind the hugely popular AR game have stressed that the sale won't impact the game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/pokemon-go-promises-it-wont-introduce-intrusive-ads-or-playtime-restrictions">"intrusive ads" won't be part of the experience</a>. The devs have also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-go-doubling-amount-of-daily-remote-raids-has-nothing-to-do-with-new-owners">doubled the amount of daily remote raids</a> players can take part in, but that was reportedly in the works before the sale too.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Paradox Pokémon in GO in the comments.</em></p>

			<p>Capcom has cancelled a <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-devs-talk-optimization/">lecture</a> it was meant to give at the Computer Entertainment Developers Conference 2025 event (CEDEC) in Japan on Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance and optimization amid harassment and threats made to developers from players upset with the game's performance on PC.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-cancels-lecture-about-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-as-devs-face-threats-and-harassment/">Automaton</a>, the decision to cancel the event is likely a choice made by Capcom to protect the members of its development team who would have been in attendance, though no official reason for the cancellation has been stated. </p>



<p>The lecture was titled "<em>Making 'Monster Hunter Wilds' Run Smoothly! Everything You Need To Know About Optimization</em>," and according to its <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/">description</a>, would have delved into Capcom's journey of trying to ensure that Monster Hunter Wilds would run smoothly on the wide variety of machines used by players across the globe.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' performance on PC has been an issue since the game launched earlier this year. Capcom has made it clear that it is aware of the issues players are facing, and this talk was intended to be part of the company's ongoing work to fix the problems the game has and communicate with players who are having trouble running the game on their devices. </p>



<p>The recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/"> Title Update 2</a> was also meant to include several fixes for PC players, though not everything was addressed, and there are still a number of bugs and optimization issues that have yet to be squashed. Capcom <a href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1941110323005857917">released a patch</a> following the Title Update 2, though several issues still persist. According to Automaton, individual members of the Monster Hunter Wilds team have been threatened by players upset over the game's PC performance, along with harassment towards the whole Monster Hunter Wilds team. </p>



<p>Capcom has also published <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">a statement on its website</a> regarding harassment and threats to its employees, making it clear that while it takes feedback from players seriously, it will "<em>respond appropriately</em>" to threats and acts of harassment, and in severe cases, it will contact the appropriate authorities and pursue criminal proceedings.</p>
