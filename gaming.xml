There's no better news than "game that hasn't had an update in years just received one", and this week that applies to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. Despite first releasing eight years ago - almost to the day, its eighth anniversary is in a couple of days time on March 24th - and not receiving a new update in two years, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/overhype-studios">Overhype Studios</a> has come back to the game not just with some fixes, but with some new content too.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First, the new stuff. There's a couple of new legendary locations that you can explore now, the first one being a place called Abandoned Village. A simple name, but this one is apparently good for mid-game mercenary companies, and can apparently be found by "simply exploring the world." Overhype is keeping quiet about the second one, noting that it's "more difficult" and that you'll only find it after conquering the first one. Both will net you the opportunity to round up some new loot and legendary items too.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you'll need to start a completely new campaign in order to access the new content, which might be a bit of an extra pain for those of you that are prone to modding the game. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/365360/announcements/detail/536596558933657570">announcement post</a> for the update explicitly notes that "most mods will not work anymore until they've been updated by their authors". Steam typically automatically updates your games in the background, so you'll either have to disable your mods and wait until they're compatible with the new update, or revert to the previous version of the game (Overhype's update post has details on how you can do that).
</p>
<p>
In terms of fixes, there's a whole bunch that have been implemented that were "accumulated over the last year", from simple ones to typos, to rare bugs like one would occur when killing a Lindwurm via its tail with a poison-coated weapon. You can read the update post for the full list.
</p>
<p>
Probably also worth noting that the game is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/365360/Battle_Brothers/">70% off on Steam right now</a>, so not a bad time to jump in.

            <p>
Everybody loves a good fairytale, but I'm sure you can agree that some kind of twist on a Brothers Grimm story is a bit overdone by now, so how about a game based on folklore from Normandy? Carimara: Beneath the forlorn limbs is exactly that, a self described "short and creepy fairytale" that has a look about it where I can easily imagine walking around its world and think "cripes, it smells a bit around here, 'ey?"
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The gameplay concept is an odd one too: you are the titular Carimara, and your whole goal is to exorcise a ghost by answering questions using cards. How do you get cards? By finding different objects, people, and seemingly concepts around this messed up looking world. It could be something as simple as an acorn, or a creepy old lady, there's lots of things you can find, but judging from the trailer the people you encounter might not care about them all.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I MADE A NEW GAME !!!<br>Carimara is a Short and Creepy Fairytale üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÄ‚ú®</p><p>Wishlists, reposts, likes, and comments are highly appreciated üòÅ</p><p>Out on may 22th, steam page below ‚¨áÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/B8Lcn6ucXG">pic.twitter.com/B8Lcn6ucXG</a></p></div>‚Äî Bastinus Rex (@BastinusRex) <a href="https://twitter.com/BastinusRex/status/1903081759018738010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Carimara's Steam page is appropriately light on details, adding to its overall mysterious vibe, but it looks to me like you'll have to see out the right cards to get certain responses - though no doubt this won't be an easy task given that it all looks like everyone is a mean creep.
</p>
<p>
I'm very much into how Carimara is looking, according to developer Bastinus Rex "almost all textures and sounds are hand made and come from photos or record from the French countryside" which feels like a really nice touch. It has a lot of texture to it, really reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvidek</a> in some ways too. Plus it has a nice and short 30 to 60 minute run time, so I'm looking forward to this one dropping this coming May 22 - you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3570370/CARIMARA_Beneath_the_forlorn_limbs/">here</a>.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> is the best-selling game of all time, but it's looked pretty much the same for the entirety of its almost 14 year run. There's an argument to be made that it's showing its age in places, an argument I won't make because I don't think so myself, but all the same, as revealed during today's Minecraft Live, Mojang announced that the sandbox game is getting a pretty big visual overhaul update called Vibrant Visuals. Now, don't worry, it'll still be all blocks and squares 'n' that, but it will be changing up how lighting looks.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals">blog post</a> explains things in a bit more detail, with one of the big things being that there'll now be volumetric lighting. What that translates to is things like sunlight shining more naturally across different surfaces, even shining through windows, and every individual block will cast its own shadow. Mobs and items will glow a bit more too, so it's not just about the overworld lighting.
</p>
<p>
This update is coming to the Bedrock Edition of the game first, with the post noting that it hopes to bring this "graphics revamp (either fully or partially) to as many devices as possible", though there's not even a release window for it yet. There are plans to bring it to Java Edition too.
</p>
<p>
I might not have much of a horse in this race as someone that only really plays Minecraft once in a blue moon (and normally swiftly puts it down because I'm not that kind of creative and I get too stressed out from survival mode), but honestly, I'm not a fan. Minecraft is inherently not a natural looking game, and this lighting overhaul just adds a touch to much realism for my tastes. Besides, this kind of lighting already exists in countless mods, so for plenty of people it's not even really needed.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there were a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap">few other announcements</a> from Minecraft Live too, like the fact you'll soon be able to fly around on friendly versions of ghasts, which I do quite like the look of. There's a live event taking place from March 25 to April 7 too where you get to hang out with Jack Black's version of Steve to defend a village in some mini-games, which'll net you a cape if you're successful. Bit less exciting, but to each their own!

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey.1142265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft proudly <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached two million players, surpassing the launch of Origins and Odyssey. On release day, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had broken</a> the milestone of one million copies sold.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a strong start, which the publisher absolutely needed after all the financial disappointments of the last couple of years, between Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. As you already know if you're an avid Wccftech reader, there are strong rumors that the Guillemot brothers, who own the biggest stake in the company, are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly seeking investors to create a new entity that would control Ubisoft's largest franchises</a>, starting with Assassin's Creed. A healthy debut for Shadows will most likely help in that regard.</p>
<p>Still, it's too early to tell how successful the game will really end up being. The split between platforms will also be interesting to analyze. The game marks <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's return to big day-one releases on Valve's Steam</a>, the largest PC platform. So far, the concurrent player peak is fairly low (60K), but PC gamers have been used to having to buy the publisher's titles via Ubisoft Connect or the Epic Games Store. It's hard to infer much from this relatively low figure; the PC platform could still make up a sizable portion of that two million user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated the game 8.7, largely praising Ubisoft Quebec's efforts and the publisher's decision to delay the game:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>

Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla, had an amusing, yet to-the-point answer for us: ‚ÄúDo you think we're going to have an Earth 2? No, no, there's no Minecraft 2.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Minecraft 2.0 is evidently not on the horizon, that doesn‚Äôt mean the survival-crafting phenomenon won‚Äôt continue to evolve. In fact, plans stretch way into the future, with a goal of at least doubling its current lifespan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe've existed for 15 years‚Äù, stated Garneij. ‚ÄúWe want to exist at least 15 years more so we actually, Agnes [Larsson, Minecraft Vanilla‚Äôs game director] and I, we work as a team. We set the vision and strategy for our game for what can we do beyond that.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs an ambition propelled by Mojang‚Äôs desire to innovate, continuing the mine and craft, so to speak, new ideas upon their rock-solid foundations. Those foundations are beginning to show their age, though, Garneij admitted, and while there are no plans for an engine overhaul, it does mean that new content, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">the newly revealed Vibrant Visuals graphics update</a>, does take time to put into practice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI think the age of the game is a challenge," Garneij said. "It's a 15-year-old platform, 15-year-old technology that slows us down in one sense. So other new games have new engines, and they can run really fast. So I would say the technology and our age [are our biggest challenges].‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Minecraft continues to be one of the most popular games in the world, and, as far as we can tell, shows no signs of slowing down.

In short: don't expect Minecraft to go free-to-play any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúYeah, it doesn't really work with the way we built it," explained Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn't work in that way for us. It's a purchase of the game and then that's it. For us it's important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that's a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It's the best deal in the world.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the industry has evolved over the years, many games have made the jump to free-to-download but infested with battle pass and cosmetic pack waters, with mixed results. Examples include Overwatch 2‚Äôs decision to go free-to-play, Destiny 2, or Minecraft‚Äôs Microsoft stablemate Halo Infinite (at least when it comes to its multiplayer).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure is of course on video game publishers and developers to find new ways to monetize to survive, but this is seemingly a pressure not felt by Garneij and her Mojang teammates: ‚ÄúNo, no. What's important for us is that many people can enjoy it still and that's going on strong still.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a sentiment expanded upon by Minecraft Vanilla‚Äôs game director, Agnes Larsson: ‚ÄùI mean for me, it‚Äôs part of the important values of Minecraft. I think it's become such an important thing of what Minecraft is and the perfect culture and values, and I think we all here can agree on that. It's a thing for the game and it's one part of what makes the game strong. It has strong values.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Comparison Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft will continue to evolve without asking its players to spend money for new features, then.

Keita Takahashi is probably one of the most recognizable names in games, in no small part thanks to a game that needs no introduction, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>. That game was made at Namco, before it became the Bandai Namco we know today, and Takahashi actually left the studio back in 2006 around the time they merged, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/20/150569.html">GameSpark</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/katamari-damacy-creator-keita-takahashi-talks-about-his-decision-to-leave-bandai-namco-and-the-inspiration-behind-his-new-game/">Automaton</a>), the developer has shared the reason behind his departure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"I left the company because I didn‚Äôt want to be limited to only working with the people there," Takahashi quite plainly put it. "I wondered why I was only making games with Japanese people. I thought if I could develop games with more people from other countries, I would be able to get ideas from different perspectives. I‚Äôm currently developing games with a range of people from all over the world."
</p>
<p>
Takahashi is currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> at his studio Uvula, a quite lovely looking game that looks to explore disability and the small difficulties that come in daily life in his usual, quirky way. Despite working with a more global team these days, he did admit that he doesn't know "what school culture is like in the US, so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements" in to a T. 
</p>
<p>
He still thinks that there'll be something for everyone in the game though, as the main character doesn't want to go to school because they're being bullied, and Takahashi thinks that "this is something that happens worldwide, not just in Japan. I was actually bullied myself, and never felt like going to school."
</p>
<p>
I enjoy Takahashi's work a lot, Katamari is a game I'd recommend to probably anyone, and Wattam was a delight too, weirdness and all. Whether I'm the target audience or not doesn't seem to matter much to Takahashi either as he said: "I make games that I feel satisfied with, so I‚Äôd like people to play them if they want to. I guess I probably should make games while thinking about the target audience, but I‚Äôll work on that in my next life." Quite happy that he's making the games he is in this one myself.
</p>
<p>
To a T is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">due out May 28th</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stay-forever-home-hands-on-%E2%80%93-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pet-simulation-in-vr.1142214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stay-forever-home-hands-on-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pet-simulation-in-vr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I‚Äôd be the first to admit that my time with VR and AR is fairly limited, but at this years GDC in San Francisco, it was impossible not to be drawn in by the awesome tech and games that developers are working on in the space. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways from GDC is that I‚Äôve walked away eager to try out virtual reality again after briefly giving it a go a few years back.</p>



<p>One game that stuck out as particularly impressive to me was Stay: Forever Home, a soon-to-be-released XR game that pushes the boundaries of VR and AR technology to create a fully immersive pet simulator. Its developers, Windup Minds, are a small fully-remote team consisting of veteran developers behind the likes of Meta‚Äôs Bogo and First Steps.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home evolves around your pet named Ember, a magical canine that lives by your side and is fully responsive to your actions to how you also interact with the world. Ember is powered by unscripted AI-powered behaviour that creates a familiar feeling that everyone with a real-life dog knows. From mischievous antics to being needy because she wants to be petted, it creates a genuine feeling of immersion that no pet simulator on the market has been able to pull off. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developers say that the game designs to ‚Äúlove you back‚Äù and during my 25-30 minute demo, I got to see exactly what they meant first-hand. Despite being initially weirded out by feeling somewhat unnatural wearing a VR headset and watched by the developers (again, I‚Äôm not super into VR), it didn‚Äôt take long to realise that the developers were onto something special.</p>



<p>To start, I was introduced to Ember who appeared in a floating portal in her own world and at first she was a little nervous and skittish of who I was ‚Äì just like how a real-world pet would be. To gain her trust, I was instructed to feed her a few berries, where she progressively became more trusting of me and soon, she trusted me enough to jump from her world into mine. From here, the game was designed for me to get familiar with the controls and what you can do with Ember, from petting and brushing her down to making her fetch a ball. It was all very reminiscent of being at home with my own dogs, where I could sit down and pet her for as long as I wanted at my own leisure and mess with her floppy ears as I would do with my Labrador (sorry Max). </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stay: Forever Home VR Game Showcase | Coming April '25 #VirtualPet #PetSimulation #VirtualRealityPet" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6RDGCAQOdk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Moving on from the mixed-reality environment, I was then prompted to take Ember into a fully-fledged VR world via a magical door. This is where you can take Ember for those all important ‚Äòwalkies‚Äô that every dog needs. But this is where you‚Äôll also be able to complete challenges, do trades for treats and other items, and more. The developers tell me that these challenges and activities will be updated regularly, but for those with a more relaxed approach, you can just go for a stroll and see what antics she gets up to if preferred. Again, referring back to that unscripted AI behaviour, you‚Äôre never quite sure what she‚Äôll do. For example, in my play time, I was harvesting some berries and Ember decided to run off, only to return to be covered in mud ‚Äì something I presumably would have had to deal with later if I had longer time playing.</p>



<p>The developers told me that this is just the beginning for the VR-world and that they do have plans to update the world in the future, but that it was still early days to announce anything. Hopefully, such updates to reflect the seasons is something that‚Äôs being considered to add another layer of immersion to the world, and I think seeing Ember react to the likes of crunchy leaves in Autumn or reacting to snow on the floor for the first would be particularly fun to watch.</p>



<p>In the demo, I was also introduced to the first voice command of ‚Äúcome‚Äù or ‚Äúcome here‚Äù, where after shouting, Ember would obey the command and return to you. Other voices commands like ‚Äúsit‚Äù where also said to be coming to the game on launch, adding another layer of immersion to a game that stands out from the rest of the pet simulators on the market.</p>



<p>Overall, Stay: Forever Home breaks new ground on pet simulation, not only because of the use of the technology, but because of the caring nature of its developers that has created an experience that I don‚Äôt think can be replicated.</p>



<p>Stay: Forever Home launches on the Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 2 on April 3, 2025 where you can <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stay-forever-home/8870151916378062/?srsltid=AfmBOoog3Z7zc5XUfg64IgVnaPPX2lIr8fr2VmzYYUUMPQdgl7iszzS8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">add it to your wishlist here</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Since September 2023, Minecraft has shifted its major update strategy to twice-annual "game drops" that add new mobs, blocks, and items to the game. With the latest Minecraft Live event, we now know what 2025's first game drop, Spring Into Life, contains. Get ready for a bunch of animal variants and some really cool new plants being added.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting with plants, players are getting something they've wanted for quite a while. After first being teased a number of years ago, firefly bushes are being added to the game. The bushes will grow in swampy biomes and near water, offering the twinkling lights of fireflies to add a little brightness to the night. Additionally, per Mojang, you'll be able to place the bushes, which are plant blocks, underneath other blocks to make your builds shine.</p><p dir="ltr">Other plant-based additions:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Leaf litter</li><li dir="ltr">Falling leaves</li><li dir="ltr">Dry grass</li><li dir="ltr">Cactus flowers</li><li dir="ltr">Bushes</li></ul><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the best part of Minecraft, all of the animal friends you make along the way, the number of types is about to get a lot bigger. Pigs, cows, and chickens are each getting two new variants: cold and warm. The new ones will be found in cold and warm biomes, respectively. Meaning, you can find a warm variant cow in the desert, while the snowy plains biome will be home to the cold version. So if you're trying to catalog every animal that roams around in Minecraft in some sort of massive zoo, you've got some work cut out for you.</p><p dir="ltr">Other updates from the first game drop include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sheep spawning: Brown sheep spawn in sandy biomes, black sheet in chilly ones</li><li dir="ltr">Wolf variant sounds: There are now seven wolf "personalities," characterized by the sounds they make, from "cute to grumpy"</li><li dir="ltr">Ambient desert sounds</li><li dir="ltr">New lodestone recipe: They require iron ingots now, rather than netherite</li><li dir="ltr">Cartographers sell maps to biomes and villages</li><li dir="ltr">Wandering traders sell good for less and have more they will buy and sell</li><li dir="ltr">Spawn eggs in creative move have been redesigned to look like the mob they spawn</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The first game drop of 2025 will be available March 25. Game Drop 2, which was also revealed during Minecraft Live, does not have a release date yet.</p>

The happy ghast comes in a few forms, the evolution of which are up to the player to set in motion.</p><p dir="ltr">The most interesting aspect of the happy ghast is that it allows players to fly around the overworld. If you've been playing Minecraft long enough and have been to The End, that might not sound all too valuable while you whip around the map with your elytra wings. However, for newer players, the process of getting a happy ghast begins in the Nether--a location you visit long before you venture into The End. That brings flight to users much earlier in the game. The added bonus is that up to four people can travel on a single happy ghast, making group adventures easier.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that doesn't mean you won't have to work for it. There's a process to go through in order to get a proper pilotable happy ghast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to procure your own ghost plane</strong></p><p dir="ltr">First, you'll find the dried ghast block in the Nether. The block, which looks like a tiny shriveled ghast block and is basically a dehydrated form of the ghast. Players can mine the block to bring with them to the overworld, which is where the hydration process begins.</p><p dir="ltr">Once back in the Overworld, you need to submerge the dried block fully in water. Whether that means placing it in an existing body or creating your own happy ghast hydration pool is up to you. But then the wait begins. According to Mojang, it takes about 20 real-world minutes for a dehydrated ghast to become a happy ghastling. When we experimented with this new game feature at the game maker's Sweden-based studio, we found that the timing may vary. If you place multiple dry ghast blocks at once, there's no telling which one will evolve first.</p><p dir="ltr">However, you will notice the changes as the process goes along. Much like normal ghasts, the dried ghast blocks have unhappy faces. As they slowly rehydrate, though, the frown turns into a smile. Then, the happy ghastling is born.</p><p dir="ltr">The ghastling is basically a miniature version of the happy ghast that you are unable to fly. If you wait a while longer, it'll eventually grow into a full happy ghast. If you're impatient and want to get moving, though, you can also feed the little guy snowballs to speed up the growth process.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the ghastling grows up, there's one more step before you're able to fly it. Obviously, you need a harness in order to saddle up. Those are crafted using glass, leather, and wool blocks. And right off the bat, there are a number of saddle variants available based on what color wool you use in your crafting. We may have recency bias, but the happy ghast's harness is much more visually appealing than any saddle the game has come up with yet. Take a look below at the new mod in all its glory, complete with flying goggles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463064-happyghast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463064" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463064-happyghast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463064"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463064-happyghast.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463065-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463066-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463067-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463068-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463069-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463070-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463071-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463072-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463073-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463074-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463065,1300-4463066,1300-4463067,1300-4463068,1300-4463069,1300-4463070,1300-4463071,1300-4463072,1300-4463073,1300-4463074" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463065-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463066-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463067-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463068-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463069-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463070-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463071-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463072-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463073-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1578/15789737/4463074-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_05.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463065-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463066-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463067-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463068-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463069-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_ag_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463070-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463071-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463072-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463073-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4463074-mc_granitebay_mcl_broll_happyghast_vanilla_05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">From there, simply attach yourself to the ghast like you would a horse and take to the skies. As mentioned before, up to four players can ride the happy ghast simultaneously, with the user at the front controlling direction. You don't fly as quickly as you would with a set of elytra, but it's a scenic ride that doesn't waste tons of rockets.</p><p dir="ltr">And luckily, group trips aren't all the happy ghast is useful for.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Building in the sky</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The most useful thing the happy ghast does is allow you to easily construct things in the sky. Once you get to a point in the sky you want to build, disengage yourself from the harness and you'll simply be standing on top of the ghast, ready to build. Imagine the top of the ghast basically being scaffolding that you can stand on to keep you elevated for building purposes.</p><p dir="ltr">Another excellent use for some players is going to be the ability to use happy ghasts as part of any parkour course builds. Not only can they be leashed to keep them from wandering away, but they can also be mounted on minecarts, making them moving platforms you can configure to basically be large stepping stones.</p><p dir="ltr">These are just the uses we were able to glean from a limited time playing the preview. There will surely be several other ways the happy ghast can be put to work in your realm.</p><p dir="ltr">There is currently no official release date for the second game drop of 2025. In addition to the happy ghast, the drop will also include the player locator bar, which allows you to easily track down others in your realm.</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-first-game-drop-of-2025-brings-animal-variants-and-new-plants/1100-6530234/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-first-game-drop-of-2025-brings-animal-variants-and-new-plants/1100-6530234/">Minecraft's first game drop of 2025</a>, which was also revealed during Minecraft Live, we are getting new animal variants and plant blocks.

            <p>
I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I love <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>. It was actually the first game I played in the series, and when I did I wasn't aware that it wasn't universally loved or even liked at its release. Not that knowing other people's opinions would have changed my mind about it, I'm the kind of person that will ardently defend a 6/10, but still, I think there's a lot to love about it‚Ä¶ unless you played the game on PC. For a long time, it was missing a few things that were featured in the PS2 version of the game, but GOG's Preservation Program is adding them back in.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For those of you that never got to Silent Hill 4, the thing that sort of sets it apart from the other games in the series was that you had a sort of hub area, your apartment, where you could go back to intermittently to save and rest for a moment. It's meant to be a safe zone of sorts, but after a while hauntings start happening, unsettling events like windows getting rattled, finding a dead cat in your fridge, or your kitchen faucet pouring out blood. It was a great way of keeping you on your toes, even in a supposed safe area, except a handful of them were missing from the PC version, despite being present in the code.
</p>

<p>
GOG essentially just switched them back on, but I'm sure I'm being very reductive about something that was probably a good bit of hard work. On top of bringing these hauntings back, the PC version on GOG will work better on modern hardware, and there's even modern controller support, meaning you can bust out your DualSense (and more) if that's your weapon of choice.
</p>
<p>
I know everyone's been buzzing about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> recently, and last year brought us Bloober's remake of 2, but I really do think you should give 4 a go. The second half is sort of one long escort mission for a character Eileen, though she's honestly a really likeable companion character - I often think about a line of hers where she says "Considering the circumstances, I guess we're doing pretty good, huh" that just feels so human in a way you don't see very often. Get on it, especially considering it's <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/silent_hill_4_the_room">only a fiver right now</a>.

The genre, that first flourished in the early ‚Äò90s with <em>SimCity 2000</em> has consistently delivered intricate excellence, with series like <em>Tropico</em>, <em>Frostpunk</em> and <em>Anno</em>, building to the triumph of 2015's <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. But it‚Äôs also offered more esoteric takes, with the brilliant <em>Surviving Mars</em>, <em>Before We Leave</em>, and <em>Dorfromantik</em>. But you know what they all lack? A magic light being with a story to tell. So welcome <em>Dawnfolk</em>, a glorious distilling of the genre that  streamlines and simplifies, while weaving its own spellbinding narrative. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dawnfolk-review-city-building-game-steam-indie-1851770670&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dawnfolk-review-city-building-game-steam-indie-1851770670">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-recommend-id="image://e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mika Mobile</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-recommend-id="image://e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released earlier this month, <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is a new, super-stylish top-down indie roguelike zombie shooter that is both simple and incredibly well made, with fantastically responsive controls and impressive animation and art.

<p>Over on Steam, today brings a fresh peak concurrent player count of 60,086, up from a peak of 41,412 on launch day. The game sits with a Very Positive user score rating on Valve's storefront.</p>
<p>There's still a little ways to go until Shadows tops the series' last big launch, Valhalla - though that arrived in late 2020 when many of us were stuck at home. Regardless, Shadows' launch performance so far will likely be a relief to Ubisoft, at a time when the company is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">reportedly considering a sale or some other kind of reorganisation to turn around its ailing fortunes</a>.</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, awarding it four out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that the game would support NVIDIA DLSS 4, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. Now, Funcom has confirmed that Dune Awakening will also integrate 'the latest open upscaling and advanced frame generation tech from AMD', which would appear to hint at AMD FSR 3 support (FSR 4 is exclusive to the new AMD GPUs) as well as Intel XeSS 2 with XeLL to lower latency.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to a partnership with Razer, Dune Awakening integrates Razer Chroma RGB and Razer Sensa HD Haptics, enhancing immersion. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro headset provides synced lighting and intelligent haptic feedback, just like the Freyja Gaming Cushion, which will let you feel the hum of your ornithopter as if you were sitting on it.</p>
<p>The following tweakable settings were confirmed, too:</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, Game Director Joel Bylos spoke in a brief video about the business model ahead of the pre-order opening. Dune Awakening will be buy-to-play only, so there won't be any optional subscriptions. Bylos stressed that this won't be an early access launch. That said, Funcom has a long history of supporting games like its MMOs (Anarchy Online is still active 25 years later) and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-age-of-heroes-begins-today-adding-voiced-companions-and-living-player-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Exiles</a>, and the same will happen with this one through a combination of free updates and optional premium DLCs.</p>
<p>There will also be optional Season Passes, which include several DLCs, but the DLCs will also be purchasable separately. Finally, as with most games, there will be five days of advanced access for those who purchase the most expensive editions. Bylos noted that this, however, helps the studio balance server load, ensuring a better experience for everyone. Furthermore, when the game launches for everyone, there will be new servers for those who don't wish to join a server where others have already started progressing.</p>
<p>For our interview with Joel Bylos at a recent event, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-roundtable-qa-privately-hosted-servers-are-under-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>. Dune Awakening is out in less than two months on PC, while the console versions will be released at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/634125/assassins-creed-shadows-photo-mode-infinity-nikki<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Infinity Nikki </em>and <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows </em>have become my twin obsessions for their meticulously detailed environments, textures, and weather. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">open-world dress-up game <em>Infinity Nikki</em></a>, I continue to be agog at how clothing textures are rendered with such detail and fidelity that by mere sight, I know exactly what a piece of fabric will feel like. For <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft">an action-packed romp through feudal Japan</a>, I‚Äôm constantly in a state of awe at the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">a feature that has been widely celebrated</a> since its release. Both games are so visually arresting they made me fall in love with a video game staple that I‚Äôve never really cared about before: photo mode.</p><p>Photo mode, which typically pauses the game to give players the ability to take professional grade images of their video games, is a modern gaming feature that‚Äôs been around long enough to become a standard inclusion, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/5/13/17344018/god-of-war-ps4-photo-mode">especially in AAA games</a>. But I‚Äôve never seen their appeal. It‚Äôs a video game, not some fleeting life moment. I‚Äôm not gonna fondly flip through my PS5 media gallery in five years going, ‚ÄúAww look at the time Yasuke chopped the arms and head off that guy,‚Äù like I‚Äôm looking at my grandkids‚Äô baby photos. I definitely appreciate the skill with which others have made the most out of photo modes ‚Äî like what my friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3lkotizwcc224">does</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3lkoung5vy22e">with</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ljduojaqhs2v"><em>Overwatch</em></a> ‚Äî but it was always something I ignored. </p><p>I‚Äôve played no shortage of games so interesting their moments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">demand to be captured and shared</a> but that compulsion is on another level with <em>Infinity Nikki</em> and <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em>. So, starting with the dress up game, I opened photo mode, started fiddling around with apertures and vignettes and was genuinely surprised with the results. The photos looked good! The photos weren‚Äôt <em>Vogue</em> quality, but they started to resemble the pictures that get upvoted to the moon on the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit. Even though I don‚Äôt really care to post my own photos there, it‚Äôs thrilling enough to know I‚Äôm developing a talent for something I didn‚Äôt know was in me to begin with. </p><p>I took that success with <em>Infinity Nikki </em>and translated it to <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em>. I‚Äôm actually glad the game doesn‚Äôt have the feature from the last <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed </em>where your horse automatically follows the road. Without it, I am forced to take in the game‚Äôs <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review">impressive weather and foliage</a> as I drive ole‚Äô Kikai around rather than looking at my phone after setting him on auto-pilot. That‚Äôs how I found my first picture. I was roaming around as Yasuke and I rode by a long road flanked by Japanese maples in full, deep-red autumn foliage. (At least I think they‚Äôre Japanese maples. The codex could stand a few more flora and fauna entries, Ubisoft.) The colors were so vibrant and the sound of the wind through the leaves was so invigorating, I felt I had to preserve the moment despite none of it being real. The urge was strong enough that it completely changed my feelings about photo mode altogether.</p><p>I saw that entirely fake scenery made of pixels and code and immediately opened up photo mode as though I was capturing real natural phenomena. I placed the camera behind him and zoomed out to see as much foliage as I could fit into the shot, while still keeping Yasuke as the focus of the picture. I then tinkered with the lighting to brighten the leaves and the saturation so their colors would pop. I wanted it to look like a shot Akira Kurosawa could have composed for one of his samurai epics ‚Äî a kind of thought I‚Äôve never had while taking pictures in real life or in games. This moment completely changed my perspective on video game photography. What once seemed like a cool party trick now felt like a real avenue of creative expression.</p><p>Putting the photo modes in <em>Nikki </em>and <em>Shadows</em> through their paces, I‚Äôve discovered game photography is now something I can really, earnestly do, and want to do more of. I hope to get better at it so I can one day take those skills from capturing video games to capturing real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows has surpassed Odyssey and Origins‚Äô launch numbers, hitting a 2 million player milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-2-million-players">Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows Has Surpassed 2 Million Players</h2>



<p>The official Assassin‚Äôs Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has just confirmed that Shadows has crossed the launch numbers of AC Origins and Odyssey, with 2 million players joining their latest adventure in Feudal Japan. The game managed to cross the 1 million players mark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-crosses-1-million-players-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first day</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft‚Äôs decision to launch Shadows Day One on Steam seems to be going well, too, as the game has already beaten AC Origin‚Äôs all-time peak numbers and is now closing in on AC Odyssey. Shadows has hit an all-time peak of 59,941 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a> (at the time of writing), and the number can go higher as it‚Äôs the weekend. This number beats Valhalla and Origns all-time peaks of 15,679 and 41,551 and is just a bit shy of beating Odyssey‚Äôs 62,069. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that none of the other AC games were Day One releases on Steam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows was subject to several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before it was released on March 20. However, the added time has helped the developers provide the players with a more immersive and polished experience. It‚Äôll be exciting to see how many more players the game attracts over time and whether it becomes the most-played Assassin‚Äôs Creed game yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows may have set a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endgame-credits-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for its endgame credits</a>. Also, the Japanese government is worried about ‚Äò<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>‚Äô based on the game.
