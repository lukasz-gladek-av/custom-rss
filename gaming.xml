<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159509/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In all the world, few things are as powerful as language. We use it to communicate all our hopes and fears and inner thoughts to each other. Words have a power all their own, which is why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> struck me as such an interesting concept; a JRPG that aims to teach players the fundamentals of Japanese. While I applaud the ambition behind that lofty goal, the Switch port of Rice's dungeon-crawling-focused RPG held some technical missteps that keep it from truly shining.</p>
<p>Like many JRPG fans who don't speak Japanese, I’ve always had an ambition to learn. After two years of lessons, I could count myself as conversational; I was able to make my way around Japan on multiple trips without embarrassing myself, but couldn’t call myself anywhere near fluent. Shujinkou doesn’t seem like it is going to help anyone reach fluency — the lack of voice acting so you can hear the words and symbols you are learning prevents that — but the aim here is to hammer home the basics, and that is something the game does remarkably well.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159508/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat in Shujinkou centres around Japanese words. Creatures pop up at semi-random intervals and attack your party. You can fight them with your swords, but early on, you unlock the power of Kanakae Orbs, each of which contains a symbol from one of two Japanese syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Each character can equip up to five of these Kanakae Orbs and choose one per turn to attack with. If the symbol you attack with is in the enemy’s name, you’ll do extra damage.</p>
<p>This is a fun mechanic, and it will help you learn the names of the animals you come across. The first dungeon, for example, is filled with cats (neko), dogs (inu), birds (tori), and demons (oni). Remembering the Japanese word for these common creatures is essential to getting through the many battles you’ll face in the game. The game also throws in some vocabulary in the menu and in dialogue, giving you the option to have a translation of certain words as they are dropped into conversation.</p>
<p>I will note that some of these translations are less helpful than others. While it is useful to know that 'chizu' means map, it is somewhat baffling that it offers a translation of 'shogun' as simply shogun or 'daimo' as daimo, with no effort to explain the English equivalent of those terms. It was a small detail that struck me as humorous, considering how much effort went into making the language lessons a core part of the gameplay.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Battles take place in dungeons scattered around the map. Fans of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/etrian_odyssey_origins_collection">Etrian Odyssey</a> series will immediately spot the influence here. While towns feel like something out of a point-and-click adventure like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Monkey Island</a>, dungeons switch to a first-person perspective. A map is given and must be filled in as you travel through it, complete with one-way passages and doors. Most monsters appear randomly, with a symbol in the lower right corner giving you an indication of how likely you are to be attacked as you explore.</p>
<p>These battles can be difficult enough, with some deadly enemies coming out of nowhere, even in the first one, to deliver a devastating party wipe, but the real danger comes from the larger enemies that roam the map.</p>
<p>In Shujinkou, these are called Yaiuu, but Etrian Odyssey fans will recognise these as reskins of the iconic Field On Enemies (FOEs) from that series. They pursue you around the map and are significantly more powerful than the standard enemies you run into. When you first encounter them, you should avoid them at all costs, though you’ll probably want to grind in each dungeon until you can comfortably take them on. I spent a lot of time running through the dungeon, jumping back to town to heal and upgrade my equipment before setting off to try my luck again.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159510/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat in Shujinkou is better than the rest of it, unfortunately. The characters and scenery are all flat, standing there doing the gentle swaying that I usually associate with a Flash game. The graphics are simple, but they work during the also-simple cutscenes; where I struggled with them was in navigating through the towns. Because everything is 2D, towns become awkward to move around in. Trying to remember where anything is becomes a chore, especially in areas larger than the starting town.</p>
<p>The actual enemies look better, with an almost watercolour feel to them that fits with the world Shujinkou is building. Similarly, the music is very Japanese-inspired, with a high-pitched whistle at the start of combat that feels straight out of a samurai film. It is a little predictable but, again, it works within the world.</p>
<p>Some small questionable narrative choices — we’re expected to believe that Shu retired as a samurai at the age of 24, for example — are overshadowed by the unique combat system that centres language-learning without making it feel like an educational game.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159511/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>My biggest complaints from my time with Shujinkou are things that I expect are only present in the Switch port. The non-combat inputs aren’t intuitive, so I found myself opening the party menu when I meant to close the map constantly, and I would have given anything for a quick save feature. There are also long load times that are thankfully infrequent but still frustrating.</p>
<p>Language is at the heart of Shujinkou, but it is much more than an educational game. There is a solid, unique dungeon crawler in here, which is refreshing considering how underrepresented the genre has been in recent years. A unique combat system overshadows the basic art, counterintuitive controls, and frustrating town navigation.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You won’t become fluent in Japanese by playing Shujinkou, but it will introduce the basics of both hiragana and katakana to you in a game that features the best bits of the Etrian Odyssey series in a very clever way. The combat system is solid enough that not even the counterintuitive menus could keep me from diving back in for more.</p></section>

              <p><em>War of the Worlds</em> will inevitably go down as 2025’s worst film, with its coveted <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/war-of-the-worlds-2025/">Metascore of 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/war_of_the_worlds_2025">Rotten Tomato rating of 4</a>. But if you thought that might mean the end of sci-fi movies based around surveillance footage, boy do I have a trailer for you. The first promo for Chris Pratt’s&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> just dropped, and it stinks worse than sewage-filled socks.</p> <p>I love/hate&nbsp;<em>everything</em> about this trailer. The central premise is so stunningly stupid: a near-future world where people are tried for crimes by an AI via, um, strapping them into a chair in the middle of a colossal auditorium and then having them scour all surveillance, mobile and TV footage for proof of their innocence, but only with the run-time of a movie to do it all in. Should they fail to evidence their own lack of guilt in 90 minutes, they’re instantly murdered. It’s as stupid as a hundred ’80s Arnie movies put together, but delivered without a wink of irony.</p>

  <p>LAPD officer (because of course) Pratt has been accused of the murder of his wife. BUT GET THIS! He’s also <em>the very guy</em> who designed the MERCY system! What a piece of screenwriting mastery! Will he learn a valuable life-lesson about authoritarianism? Well, given the trailer begins with a murder mystery and appears to end with car chases and an entire city blowing up, I’m going to guess no.</p>

 <p>Look, I’m mostly ambivalent about boring Chris Pratt. Yes, he’s irritatingly ubiquitous and frustratingly average, and certainly his gross personal views are far from my own, but then I enjoyed him as Starlord and there’s no taking away from his performance in <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>. Which is to say, I didn’t head into this trailer with an agenda. I sure came out of it with one! And I’m not even sure what I think about the usually excellent Rebecca Ferguson after this shitshow. She’s playing an AI, sure, but oh my goodness, even the current awful LLMs have more personality than is on display here.</p>

 <p>This really has everything. A woman fridged from before the film even starts; a cold, calculating female antagonist faced off against by the big, buff man; a countdown clock for literally no possible reason; animated percentages measuring guilt popping up like scores in a game; and just some of the most excruciating dialogue you could hope for. “I shouldn’t be here! I helped <em>create</em> the MERCY program!” “Do you honestly think that I killed my wife, or were you just programmed wrong?” Glorious stuff.</p>

 <p>But what I’m enjoying most of all is just how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-review-2000616263">it reminds me of&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em> 2025</a>. Those same faux-surveillance camera angles, the crappy quality phone footage, actors trying to do naturalistic while sounding like elementary school nativity performances (I’m talking to you, Jamie McBride). The only disappointment is that Pratt’s clamped into that chair so he can’t get up and rattle a glass door. Can you imagine being in the editing suite for this movie when Amazon drops its ultra-stinker, and realizing that all you’re going get is grim comparisons.</p>

 <p>Perhaps Chris Pratt was just tired of all the running and jumping, and wanted to make a movie where he just got to have a sit down? Fair play to that. And look, I’m willing to admit I can be wrong. I am, after all, the person who (oh God, why can’t I just delete it?) wrote the post, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-ice-cube-movie-trailer-1851786939"><em>War of the Worlds</em> Via Found Footage Looks Like A Good Time”</a>. I’m really hoping this is the yang to that yin, and this time I’m ensuring that&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> is an all-time classic. It is, after all, from the “Academy Award winning producer of&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>“!</p>

 <p>Well, um,&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>. One of the listed producers of <em>MERCY</em>, Charles Roven, was a producer on <em>Oppenheimer</em> and that movie won Best Picture. So, technically? But far better, <em>MERCY</em>‘s director, Timur Bekmambetov (best known for the wildly overrated&nbsp;<em>Night Watch</em> and&nbsp;<em>Day Watch</em>), was a producer on&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em>! Yay! Why wasn’t&nbsp;<em>that</em> mentioned in the trailer?!</p> <p>It’s out in theaters January 23, 2026, although I rather strongly suspect it won’t be the&nbsp;<em>longest</em> wait before it hits streamers after that.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t normally associate Battlefield 6 with Star Wars. This is the case, though, as a fascinating video has shown how easy it is to use Battlefield 6’s Portal tools to create Star Wars Star Destroyers to engulf the sky.</p>



<p>The force is with Battlefield 6 players. Well, it’s with those who have the imagination to use it. We’ve already reported on people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking classic Call of Duty maps</a> within hours of the game’s launch. If you thought to yourself, ‘How do you better this?’ the answer is simple: Make Star Destroyers, of course.</p>



<h2 id="h-people-are-making-star-destroyers-in-battlefield-6-portal-mode">People Are Making Star Destroyers in Battlefield 6 Portal Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re going to see a lot of crazy creations. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’ve never watched a Star Wars movie, chances are you’ve seen the mammoth Star Destroyers, which are comically large, and their construction is used for a sole purpose: Occupying space.</p>



<p>We’ve seen Star Destroyers for decades in Star Wars movies, and they’ve been a prominent presence in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. It’s time for the behemoth-like vehicles to enter the fray in Battlefield 6—as shown by <a href="https://x.com/Matavatar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matavatar</a>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, using basic Battlefield 6 Portal assets, you can easily make a Star Destroyer. It feels on brand with what Portal is going for, but it remains to be seen if the content is allowed to remain.</p>



<p>Disney is infamously hard on copyright and licensing infringements, and this could be considered such. Hopefully, this isn’t the case, and we can have custom Battlefield Star Wars maps!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What wild and wacky creations have you seen in Battlefield 6 so far? Is there anything on his level or scale?

            <p>There are still secrets in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> fans are yet to discover, but its director won't give any hints.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer about the game's forthcoming update and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">the future of the Clair Obscur franchise</a>, director Guillaume Broche discussed inspiration taken from the Final Fantasy games. While there's a reference to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> specifically in the Gestral Village - with characters swapping "Double Dyad cards" in a nod to that game's Triple Triad card game - overall Broche simply took inspiration from the general vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic series.</p>
<p>But are there other secrets yet to be uncovered? "There are, but I don't want to say them because they won't be secrets anymore," Broche told Eurogamer. "Maybe they have been found, but I haven't seen anything about it. There are still a few things, yeah."</p>

<p>Fans have scoured Expedition 33 for hints and references, but it seems some of these weren't intentional.</p>
<p>"The funny thing is [fans] found secrets that were absolutely not secrets originally," said Broche. "And we are just like, ok cool. I guess that's a secret!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">Ahead of the game's release</a>, Broche told Eurogamer he was keen for players to experiment with the game's battle system to create "broken builds" and - as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> speedrunner himself - he was looking forward to seeing no-hit runs of Expedition 33.</p>
<p>So did the community live up to his expectations?</p>
<p>"They are up to my expectations, which were very high," said Broche. "They destroyed the game very fast. My personal speedrun record was broken in one week, maybe even less."</p>
<p>The team did release an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quick-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-will-soon-nerf-the-games-best-move">update to fix one particular ability</a> that proved a little too powerful. But other than that, Broche is "very happy that people found crazy builds that even [he] didn't really think about. It's exactly what we made the system for."</p><p>What he perhaps didn't expect was for the community to discover his workings out. Fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">uncovered a trailer for an early version of the game posted on reddit</a> by Broche in a bid to find voice actors, which showed it in a very early state.</p>
<p>"It was like everybody entered my room and saw my underwear," Broche joked. "I completely forgot that it was still accessible."</p>
<p>"It's funny," he continued, "because I think that not often enough do we see real behind-the-scenes footage of games in general, like the very first prototypes that very often look terrible."</p>
<p>Sandfall CTO and lead programmer Tom Guillermin added the discovery helped to "demystify" the early stage of a project. "I think it's not that bad in the end that people found out," he said. "It's actually the same project in Unreal that we just upgraded iteratively and in the end that's the game people get to play. I think demystifying that great games are not great from the beginning, it's maybe good for the industry and also for the hobbyist as well."</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">release an update to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soon</a>, adding new quality of life options and new story scenes offering "a bit of whee and a bit of whoo".</p>

		<p>Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will not be entering early access this year, developer Unfrozen has announced. The studio has stated that it will be making some changes to the game based on player feedback including changes to the user interface, and redesigning some of the units. Doing this will also allow Unfrozen to carry out more tests on Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era before it goes into early access, which is now slated for 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Demo Now Available | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxAOAxq13IA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On the plus side, those of you looking forward to Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era have the chance to play it now, with a new demo that has been released. This demo gives access to the tutorial, three single player modes including Arena, Classic (Multi Hero), and Single Hero. On top of that, those playing the demo will be able to choose from four of the six factions planned for Early Access. The four selectable factions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temple – Classic Humans</li>
<li>Necropolis – Undead and Vampires</li>
<li>Dungeon – Underground creatures and Dark Elves</li>
<li>Schism – Altered Elves and Eldritch Abominations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sylvan and Hive factions are not going to be playable. The demo for Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era has no time limit on it, so players can spend as much time as they want digging into what is available. The game itself is a prequel to the Heroes of Might and Magic games, with events from this release referenced in other games. The combat in Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will be turn based.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this week, a group of former ZeniMax developers revealed that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-microsofts-mass-layoffs-former-elder-scrolls-online-and-blackbird-devs-form-worker-owned-studio">formed a new worker-owned studio</a> in the aftermath of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. It's called Sackbird Studios, and the logo's a bird with a sack. Following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m2rx65rjlk2v">accusations that this bird looked like it could be AI-generated</a>, the studio have responded that it isn't, but some of the images on their website were.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kotaku's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3m2s4u4igjk2f">Ethan Gach</a> reached out to Sackbird amid questioning of their avian adumbration on social media. "Our trademarked logo was hand-drawn by a human artist working directly with the founding team," reads the response from a studio spokesperson. "Some supporting visuals on our website, like the Baltimore skyline and social icons, were generated with AI image tools and then customised and polished by us."</p>
<p>"At the time, we didn't have an artist on staff and were racing to meet a launch deadline, so AI helped us prototype quickly," they continued, adding that they don't view the controversial tech as "a replacement for artists", but rather "just another brush in the box". "The final look, humour, and heart are all Sackbird," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>It's certainly not a great look for the new studio, who'll rightly face strong scrutiny about use of AI going forwards. The aspect of the statement which has caught my attention is the idea Sackbird were racing to meet a launch deadline. Given how strongly the group emphasised being "fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games" in their launch press release, I'm struggling to see how that deadline can't have been self-imposed to at least some degree if the staff have the level of control they're suggesting.</p><p>That said, getting the ball rolling quickly on a new venture so you minimise any delays in re-establishing an income is at least understandable as a motivation, especially given the Sackbird team were recently laid off from their previous jobs. Whether that justifies leaning on AI, rather than ensuring that paid artists were employed or commissioned to handle every bit of art necessary to get through the all-important launch phase of your new studio is a judgement each of us'll have to make individually.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-ps4-xbox-one-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-little-nightmares-3-on-ps4-or-xbox-one-all-platforms-explained.1321681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You only have to look at the previous platforms the Little Nightmares franchise has appeared on to see how inclusive the series is. As time moves on, so do business decisions. We’re seeing if Little Nightmares 3 is available on PS4, Xbox One, as well as current-gen consoles, and PC.</p>



<p>We remember the PS4 and Xbox One era like it was yesterday. It was a better time in many ways, with regular exclusive releases, brands genuinely competing to be the best, and before game and console price increases became the norm. Titles releasing on old-gen hardware—like the PS4 and Xbox One—are becoming more antiquated by the second, which brings us to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<p>You’re here to see if Little Nightmares 3 is on PS4 and Xbox One—as well as other platforms—and we have the answer you seek.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-little-nightmares-3-on-xbox-one-or-ps4">Can You Play Little Nightmares 3 on Xbox One or PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This one certainly isn’t floating away from anyone. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 is available to buy digitally and physically on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles.</strong></p>



<p>The love for old-gen continues with <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>. It’s hard to believe that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S came out five years ago. The PS4 and Xbox One generation feels like a lifetime ago. As such, many companies are foregoing old-gen development as it costs too much money, and the de-optimization required can be time-consuming.</p>



<p>We’d argue it’s easier for a title like Little Nightmares 3 to make this transition. Not to disrespect its graphics, it still clearly boasts a premium, high-quality polish—but not having to generate a large open-world should make development easier.</p>



<p>You only have to look at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-game-size-pre-load-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s file size</a> to see this. With the Little Nightmares franchise already past the 20 million mark in lifetime sales, having PS4 and Xbox One versions will help bolster this number. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-platforms-explained">All Little Nightmares 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy and play Little Nightmares 3 on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>Short of a mobile port, or even VR, this is as complete as a release gets in 2025! PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC owners can all procure and play! Its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-little-nightmares-3-cost-price-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a> is slightly greater than recent games, but it’s still a fair price for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-little-nightmares-3-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of its length</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>You certainly aren’t starved of options when it comes to buying Little Nightmares 3, then. With even more content on the way—thanks to previously announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-chapters-dlc-guide-secrets-of-the-spiral-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC chapters</a>—this is as good a time as ever to jump on the LN3 bandwagon.

            <p>MMORPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was finally released in the west yesterday, and is already off to a strong start on Steam.</p>
<p>It's already peaked at almost 95k concurrent players, meaning it has more players at the time of writing than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Marvel Rivals, and EA Sports FC 26.</p>
<p>The anime MMO from Bandai Namco was previously released in Japan and was set to receive a western release by Amazon Games. However, in August 2024 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Japanese servers were shut down and the western release cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">Tencent-funded developer Bokura picked up the project</a>, added Star Resonance to the name, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-will-release-outside-of-japan-this-year">now released it as a free-to-play game</a> across PC (Steam, Epic Games Store) and mobile (iOS, Google) in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Oceania.</p>
<p>But after all that, was it worth the wait?</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> from players so far would suggest not. Blue Protocol currently has a Mixed rating, with criticisms of its lack of content, generic gameplay, and gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>"Just once I would love to get an anime MMO without 1000 currencies, gacha, 5000 'presents' with no real value and overloaded UI," wrote one Steam user. Wrote another: "This absolute slop represents the culmination of the cancer that has killed the MMO genre."</p>
<p>Other players, meanwhile, are more positive, claiming it has "great art and visuals" and that for a free-to-play game it's worth a go.</p>
<p>At the time of its Japanese cancellation, the developers stated the "difficult decision" to end service was made as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol</a> ahead of its release way back in 2023, and while it was enjoyable I questioned if it could do enough to differentiate itself from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> competition. Once the game was released in Japan, it didn't receive a particularly positive reception, which ultimately led to its cancellation.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol's Star Resonance revival will certainly give it a second lease of life, but whether it was worth it remains questionable.</p>

<p>Well that's... unexpected</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="def3cfcd30d27"><a title="Mario Kart World Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/def3cfcd30d27/mario-kart-world-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, you read that headline correctly, rather than pushing the prices up to match what we've seen everywhere else in the industry of late, select EU retailers appear to be <em>cutting</em> the cost of Switch 2 consoles and bundles (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/10/amazon-france-reduces-price-of-nintendo-switch-2-and-bundles/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Nintendo-10015151-Switch-2/dp/B0F2JCL3NZ?th=1&amp;tag=nintlife09-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon France</a> was the first retailer brought to our attention to be implementing such a cut, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> Switch 2 bundle and pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> option now down to <strong>€469</strong> (a 6% drop from the previous €499,99). Standard Switch 2 purchases are currently sold out on the online storefront, but French outlet <a href="https://www.nintendo-town.fr/2025/10/10/france-amazon-et-e-leclerc-baissent-le-prix-de-la-nintendo-switch-2-et-de-ses-bundles/">Nintendo Town</a> reports that it has seen the same discount and is now listed at €419.</p>
<p>It's currently unclear whether this is a temporary or permanent discount, though it follows the same price cut seen at French retailer <a href="https://www.e.leclerc/fp/pack-console-nintendo-switch-2-le-jeu-mario-kart-world-sur-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2-0045496321529">E.Leclerc</a>, where the console and bundles can now be found with the 6% reduction.</p>
<p>Now yes, €30 might not be the most drastic of price shifts, but it's a notable discount all the same — that's a decent chunk of money towards a new game or accessory, let's not forget.</p>
<p>It's a similar trend for the region as what we initially saw with game listings. Mere days after the Switch 2 was revealed, a handful of French retailers were already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/select-eu-retailers-are-abandoning-nintendos-suggested-retail-price-for-switch-2-games">abandoning Nintendo's suggested €80 price tag</a> for titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a>, and were listing each for closer to €60 instead.</p>
<p>From a global perspective, it'll be all eyes on Black Friday next month where we'd <em>assume</em> Switch 2 discounts will be available.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-is-launching-in-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-according-to-amd-leaker.1321657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker Kepler has <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/post-270885018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed on the NeoGAF board</a> that Sony is planning to launch the PlayStation 6 console in 2027, with the caveat that 'unexpected delays' could still happen.</p>



<p>This would be right on time for a 7-year lifecycle, just like its predecessor, the PlayStation 4. The main difference would be with regards to the PlayStation 5 Pro, which was released four years after the PS5 (and therefore only three years before the alleged PS6 launch window), whereas the PlayStation 4 Pro appeared on the market three years after the PS4 and four years before the launch of the PS5.</p>



<p>Rumors about the specifications of the PlayStation 6 have been circulating for a while, mainly due to YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an estimated computing power of 34 to 40 Teraflops with a massive ray tracing performance uplift of 6x to 12x compared to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, AMD and Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have divulged new details on their ongoing Project Amethyst collaboration</a> to improve hardware and software in future GPUs and consoles. Three technologies were singled out at this time: Radiance Cores, Neural Arrays, and Universal Compression. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first one is specifically designed to deliver that rumored ray tracing performance boost: the Radiance Cores hardware blocks will accelerate the computationally intensive ray tracing traversal calculations, freeing shader cores to work on the rest of the rendered scene. </li>



<li>Neural Arrays, on the other hand, are dedicated AI accelerator units integrated into the GPU architecture. They are designed to handle machine learning inference tasks natively on the console hardware, achieving much greater efficiency compared to current methods.</li>



<li>Finally, Universal Compression is a new device-agnostic compression technology that reduces the data footprint across textures, geometry, and other game assets without significantly reducing quality. It optimizes memory bandwidth and storage, allowing games to load faster and operate more efficiently. This should also translate into improved streaming performance, possibly reducing stuttering during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, in that video, PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased that these technologies would appear on a new console (the PlayStation 6) in a few years' time</a>. If the rumor is true, that just means two years, possibly a bit sooner than most expected. Indeed, it feels like we only started getting 'next-generation' games in the past couple of years, whereas most titles previously supported cross-generation releases. Still, this generation has a few aces left, like The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares 3 offers a new world with new characters. As this is the third game in the series, onlookers finally peeking into the franchise are curious as to whether this is a direct sequel, if the worlds are reconnected, and also if you need to play either of the first two games before hopping into Little Nightmares 3 for the first time.</p>



<p>This might surprise you, but the Little Nightmares franchise has sold over 20 million units worldwide! This is a phenomenal achievement for an indie title. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-little-nightmares-3-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> is moving closer to AA territory with the introduction of Supermassive Games—a renowned horror expert.</p>



<p>But today, we’re seeing if there’s a disconnect between Little Nightmares 3 and the titles that came before it, and tell you everything you need to know if you’re on the fence about buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-or-2-before-playing-little-nightmares-3">Do You Need To Play Little Nightmares 1 or 2 Before Playing Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to explore, but you’re not Alone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You do not need to play Little Nightmares 1 or Little Nightmares 2 before playing Little Nightmares 3, as this is a new adventure independent of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> features two brand-new characters—Low and Alone. The side-scrolling puzzle-platformer also takes place in a fresh location—The Nowhere. None of these properties has featured in previous Little Nightmares games. </p>



<p>So if you’re worried about missing out on crucial story lore or not understanding the game due to missing a piece of the puzzle, we can assure you that everything is learned and uncovered as you play.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-the-first-two-games">Is Little Nightmares 3 Connected To The First Two Games?</h2>



<p><strong>The short is no, we don’t think Little Nightmares 3 is directly connected to either of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p>At best, there’s a loose sense that Low and Alone share the same world, although it’s not directly implied. Whereas Little Nightmares 1 and 2 are more overt, as Six—the main character in Little Nightmares 1—also appears alongside Mono in Little Nightmares 2.</p>



<p>The second game is a prequel to the first, which is why they tie together so nicely and fittingly. But Little Nightmare 2 is its own entity. Everything about it is fresh, and we think it symbolizes the new beginning as the series’ development shifts away from Tarsier Games to Supermassive Games.</p>



<p>There could be some subtle clues we’ve missed throughout our playthrough—which we discussed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—otherwise, you should be fine if this is your first LN experience!</p>



<hr>



<p>To recap, you don’t need to play either of the first two games before playing Little Nightmares 3. The world may be faintly connected, but this is a new adventure, and a new story.

            <p>Forthcoming extraction shooter ARC Raiders will make progression wipes voluntary, through its newly revealed Expedition Project.</p>
<p>Progression wipes essentially reset a player's progress in a game and are a blunt method of putting all players on an even field. These are used in plenty of shooters, particularly at the start of a new season, but can be controversial. While Escape from Tarkov has had regular wipes, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1975305060574732357">recently u-turned</a> on a decision to reset power in its forthcoming Renegades expansion due to player backlash.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders will include voluntary progression wipes, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Embark Studios has now explained</a>, but the developer has its own method of implementing them.</p>

<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides," the studio wrote in a blog post. "Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall."</p>
<p>The system in ARC Raiders is called the Expedition Project. The explanation is a little complicated, at least until we go hands-on and try it ourselves, but the full game will introduce the Expedition Project at level 20.</p>
<p>This ongoing project (or mission, really) operates on a repeating cycle of roughly eight weeks, with players gradually contributing towards its progression. Once complete, a progression reset will be available. If progress is not complete, players will be able to carry it over to the next finalisation window.</p>
<p>A progression reset will wipe character levels, skills, inventory, crafting capabilities, and everything else associated with progress. Cosmetics (both earned and purchased), awards, achievements and the like will remain.</p>
<p>To incentivise completing the Expedition Project, players will be rewarded with permanent account unlocks, unique cosmetic rewards, and buffs for the following Expedition cycle.</p>
<p>"One point to drive home is that we are being very careful about the nature of these benefits," the blog post reads. "Completing a reset should never give a player a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset.</p>
<p>"Initially, these benefits will centre around cosmetics and bragging rights, quality-of-life, and smoothing out some aspects of progression for those who have gone through a reset."</p>
<p>Essentially, this system gives players the power to reset their game in their own time, prolonging the game's longevity through repetition with less pressure on endgame activities.</p>
<p>"It's not a silver bullet," the studio admitted, "and won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a complex topic, so we'll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and follow up as necessary."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">ARC Raiders will have a free public network test later this month</a>, to test out the game ahead of its full release on 30th October.</p>
<p>It's releasing, therefore, between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> as something of an underdog of the three. Still, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">can't type "ARC Raiders" into the Call of Duty chat</a> as it's been censored.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/discord-data-breach-leaks-70000-government-ids-used-for-age-verification/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Discord has confirmed that a data breach of their customer support platform has leaked at least 70,000 government IDs that were being used for age verification, something required in the UK since July to satisfy the Online Security Act.</p>
<p>I think you’ll agree that this is pretty much the exact opposite of online security.</p>


<p>Amongst the leaked information was personal information, including partial credit card details, messages to customer support agents and, with the need to diagnose and manually verify disputed age checks, government ID images. No full payment details or user login details were affected.</p>
<p>The attack on Discord didn’t affect the company’s main servers and infrastructure, but instead targeted a third-party customer support service. This is a particularly common avenue that bad actors use to gain access to company data, by obtaining logins for external services used for internal communication and customer support.</p>
<p>The extent of the cyber-attack is in dispute, with Discord admitting to 70,000 government IDs being leaked, but the hacker group that has claimed responsibility say that they had access for 58 hours by compromising the account of a support agent at an outsourced provider. This let them download 1.5TB of sensitive data that includes over 2.1 million government IDs. Discord disputes these figures, telling the BBC that these numbers were inflated and “part of an attempt to extort payment”.</p>

<p>While Discord did not name the third party service, the hackers said that it was the Zendesk portal that was affected. Speaking to the BBC, Zendesk said that its systems were not compromised through a vulnerability within its platform.</p>
<p>Discord is still in the process of investigating the attack and working with law enforcement, and they are getting in touch with affected users.</p>
<p>They state:</p>
<p>“If you were impacted, you will receive an email from <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b4dadbc6d1c4d8cdf4d0ddc7d7dbc6d09ad7dbd9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>. We will not contact you about this incident via phone – official Discord communications channels are limited to emails from <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="cba5a4b9aebba7b28bafa2b8a8a4b9afe5a8a4a6">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>.”</p>
<p>So…. remind me again why successive UK governments decided to not only pass online age verification laws, but also not take a hands on approach to securely implement an anonymised form of this?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has insisted players won’t see anything made by generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI is one of the hottest topics in the video game industry, with the pressure on publishers to cut costs and speed up development in order to boost profits despite the risk of backlash from some fans. Indeed, according to a report by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Financial Times</a>, EA’s new prospective owners (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">the ones who just spent $55 billion to take the company private</a>) are betting on the use of generative AI to do just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And EA itself, even before it was bought out, had signalled that it was all-in on generative AI, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">CEO Andrew Wilson insisting AI is “the very core of its business.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now though, at least when it comes to Battlefield 6, generative AI is taking a backseat. Rebecka Coutaz, general manager of original series developer DICE in Sweden, and Criterion, the UK studio now also a part of what’s collectively called Battlefield Studios, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> that while generative AI “is very seducing,” currently there is no way to work it into the developers’ daily work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Coutaz clarified that generative AI is used in preparatory stages "to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s approach here for Battlefield 6 is in contrast to Activision’s for Call of Duty. Call of Duty has suffered a number of generative AI controversies in recent years, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash"><u>now-infamous six-fingered zombie Santa bundle</u></a>. Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">Activision was forced to add an ‘AI generated content disclosure’ to the Steam page for Black Ops 6</a> after Valve changed its storefront rules.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/santa-claus-1733746080205-1760086374302.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Coutaz’s comments, and the current lack of an AI generated content disclosure on the Battlefield 6 Steam page, we won’t see something similar in EA’s rival first-person shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, Treyarch associate creative director, Miles Leslie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">suggested generative AI images had made their way into Black Ops 6 by mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools,” Leslie told IGN ahead of Black Ops 7's reveal at Opening Night Live 2025. “I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's, how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting the Black Ops 7 Steam page <em>does</em> include the AI disclosure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Battlefield Studios' stance on generative AI hold for much longer, especially with EA's new owners breathing down its neck? In the interview with the BBC, Coutaz sounded optimistic about the use of the tech going forward. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate over generative AI is bigger than in-game assets. Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-issues-official-statement-in-response-to-generative-ai-claim-as-openai-ceo-sam-altman-calls-sora-2-copyrighted-character-videos-interactive-fan-fiction">Nintendo issued a statement in response to claims around generative AI</a>, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman calling Sora 2 copyrighted character videos “interactive fan fiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><u>formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</u></a>, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.

            <p>Bloober, the on-a-good-run Polish developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">the Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> still has a surprising amount of other games nearly ready to release.</p>
<p>First among them is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, the suspenseful, painter-themed creep-a-thon that began the studio's horror specialisation nearly 10 years ago. This is called Layers of Fear: The Masterpiece Edition, it's described as a "complete edition", which presumably means it bundles all additional content released for the game, and it will apparently be released this year. There's no more specific date than "2025", which is odd given how close to the end of the year we are, but perhaps it's being held for a sudden shadow-drop during a Nintendo Direct or The Game Awards.</p>
<p>The rest of the games come from Bloober's subsidiary studio Broken Mirror Games, which was set up in 2024, and appear to be making smaller-scale projects. The first of them is I Hate This Place, an isometric open-world horror game, which has been pushed back slightly from a launch this year to 29th January next year. This is the 80s, comic-book styled adventure inspired by a comic of the same name, written by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin.</p>

<p>Broken Mirror has two further games that both still carry codenames. Project M is a Switch exclusive, intriguingly - and both Switch 1 and 2 are mentioned - and it will release next year. A teaser trailer for the game shows live-action footage of a man climbing a ruined internal staircase in a block of flats and then making a shocking discovery. Meanwhile, a girl in a white dress approaches the camera in a garden outside.</p>

<p>The other game is Project F, which has no platforms assigned to it or any apparent marketing material.</p>
<p>But that's not all! Broken Mirror has a creepy virtual reality game very close at hand, called Star Trek: Infection. It was revealed a couple of months ago at Gamescom and will be released 11th December this year, on Meta Quest 3S, Meta Quest 3, and SteamVR.</p>

            <p>Altruism is a funny concept. Most of us can agree that bestowing a generous gift of greening shelf-stable bread-like product on the local park pigeons is a nice thing to do, but what of the knowledge that moulders in the back of our minds all the while, telling us: keep this up long enough, and you'll definitely end up with a loyal army of skyborne scavengers willing to enact your every destructive whim at a mere flick of your wrist? Feed them the really good bread, they might even let you throw them at things. From super seeded, to superceding god. Here's the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bench">The Bench</a>.</p>

<p>"Find hidden objects, solve quirky puzzles, and command pesky pigeons in this charming, interactive adventure," coos the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183410/The_Bench">Steam page</a>. Charming interactive adventure, it says, while gleefully showing off several possible instances of bird-related grievous bodily harm, including but not limited to: knocking someone out by throwing a pigeon at a precarious stack of boxes, knocking someone out by cutting out the middle bird and just lobbing a stale piece of bread directly at their forehead, throwing a pigeon right at a fat iron padlock, blowing up a balloon seller's cart by hurling a pigeon at the helium tank, and at one point, just straight up drowning someone. There are also some nice puzzles. From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote><p>In The Bench, you’ll step into the shoes of a wise, seasoned senior enjoying his day in a lively, interactive world. But don’t get too comfortable, your mission is to find the hidden objects scattered around you, as you escape the clutches of the retirement home, for a life in the real world, all with the help of your trusted pigeon army.</p>
<p>Explore beautifully designed, colorful maps, each with its own quirks, and dive into fun mini-games, such as solving newspaper puzzles, playing chess, bowls, or going fishing! There’s plenty to do to keep your mind sharp and stop you from dozing off.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one's out October 24th. Not strictly a Halloween game, but I suppose that depends how you feel about pigeons.</p>

            <p>Halo art director Glenn Israel has left Halo Studios after 17 years working on the franchise.</p>
<p>Israel worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-3-odst">Halo 3: ODST</a> and the most recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>, across both Bungie and 343 Industries (now known as Halo Studios).</p>
<p>He shared news of his departure on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenn-israel-19696485_as-of-today-and-after-seventeen-long-years-activity-7379767940897959936-btQc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAD-fd-sBjxKws0-toSdD-oiBHCNKEUll3C8">LinkedIn</a> last week, with an ominous message that appears to allude to discontent within the studio.</p>

<p>"As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe," wrote Israel. "There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year."</p>
<p>Israel continued, with a message for those working in the games industry.</p>
<p>"I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*," he wrote. "No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong."</p>
<p>Of course, people leave their jobs all the time, but this is certainly an alarming message that seems to suggest Israel's ethics and values have been compromised in some way.</p>
<p>Further, as YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmqrY8ng2GI">Rebs Gaming</a> has reported, all but one of the nine-strong art team credited in Halo Infinite have now left the studio, while chief of staff Melissa Boone also recently left.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment on Israel's departure.</p>
<p>All of this is ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-studios-revealing-more-on-next-projects-yes-plural-at-next-months-world-championship-event">reveal of the studio's next projects at the Halo World Championships</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The last Halo game released was 2021's Halo Infinite, which has seen multiplayer numbers plummet. And following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs at Microsoft</a> this year, the departure now of a veteran developer is a worrying sign for its flagship franchise.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ratatan-early-access-review-%E2%80%93-rhythm-action-warfare-is-the-best-kind-of-warfare.1321600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<hr>
<p>Few sounds are as deeply ingrained in our household as the merry chant of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a>. A PSP favourite, and with three games in the bag, Sony then seemed to forget about the little one-eyed weirdos, occasionally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">dusting the first two games off for remasters</a>. The team at TVT and Ratata Arts haven’t forgotten, though. Made up of various team members from the original games, they’ve set sail on an all new, rhythm-action extravaganza in the shape of Ratatan. For all the changes and modernity that they’ve brought, it’s still of game of tiny weirdos, impressive footwork and merry chants. I wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Animation: Welcome to Rataport" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANtXCPQ7eD0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Expansive. That’s the word that you’ll associate with Ratatan if you’ve played previous Patapon games. There’s simply more here, and that starts with choosing your Ratatan. There’s eight incredibly cool, but equally cute, leading characters to choose from, all of whom have different abilities and weapon selections.</p>


<p>Mashuma is clad in a mushroom – or maybe is a mushroom? – and plays a toadstool bagpipe. That’s very cool. Pyokorappa looks like a cyberpunk rabbit, plays a trombone, and sounds suspiciously like a Patapon. That’s all very cool too. Frogs, owls, ninja cats, whichever of the lovingly created characters you go for, you’ll find you now have direct control over them, functioning as lead instrumentalist and general, so not only do you have to command your diminuitive single-eyed army, you have to think about where you’re standing too. At first, this feels like more than the tiny human mind can cope with, but you soon start to understand how it all works.</p>


<p>Ratata looks stunning. The artwork here is beautiful, taking the stripped back visual design of Patapon and laying on a massive palette of colour, detail and vibrancy. Everything feels alive, and that sense of life carries through from the characters and different enemies you come across, all the way to the hub world that you visit in-between each run.</p>
<p>Each run sees you taking your army of Ratatan, which are one eyed fish people as opposed to one eyed… actually, what were Patapon? Presumably, they’re the same species as Mike Wazowski? Some sort of cyclops? Anyway, you set out int the overworld with your army, fighting your way through small skirmishes until you meet the huge boss at the end. That starts out with a huge dinosaur-esque badnik, before moving things onto giant armoured crabs and shark/bull hybrids.</p>
<p>Whatever awesome-looking form they take, you’ll need to be prepared, and you do that through repeated runs. Patapon was fundamentally always roguelite adjacent, rewarding repeated runs through the same areas, building your armoury and levelling up your army. That’s just more obvious here, and as you beat all those evil little one eyed armies with your good one eyed army, you’ll pick up weaponry and materials that you’ll need to advance further.</p>

<p>Besides that, there’s a run of Ratakurata cards that you collect, enhancing your attacks with different effects. The two main card types add an elemental attack to either your standard move or your special, while others may prolong certain effects or give you higher damage or better defense. Each run can be completely different, between choosing alternate lead characters, who then use different Cubon types, with access to alternate weaponry, and then the random factor and decisions of selecting your Ratakurata cards. It really helps to avoid some of the grind, when everything can be changed up run by run as you seek out your favourite setup. It throws a lot at you, but manages to maintain a distinct sense of self and direction in the process</p>
<p>It all comes down to the music though. Rhythm-action games live and die by their soundtrack, and Ratatan serves up bop after bop. I don’t remember a rhythm action game in recent memory that has had me bopping along as consistently as Ratatan does, with each world shifting through clearer genres and musical composition than Patapon ever did. It will make you smile, and it will make you happy, and that kind of unburdened joy is in short supply these days.</p>

<p>As you progress, your hub town swells to include various different townspeople and merchants, all of whom want to help you out, or charge you a suspiciously high amount of materials in exchange for something else. Levelling up and crafting weapons for your army is a highlight, and some of the designs for the special weaponry is Monster Hunter-level good. They definitely need to make more of these, because what’s better than a one-eyed army setting off into battle with an array of sick weaponry?</p>
<p>Ratatan is exactly what I wanted it to be. In Early Access this is a fresh, modern take on Patapon’s iconic action with an invigorating visual design and awesome soundtrack. All I want now from the journey to 1.0 is even more of this.</p>

			<p>The Little Nightmares franchise has been a bit of a surprise hit, moving over 20 million units to date, so it’s <em>not </em>surprising that publisher Bandai Namco has opted to continue on with a third entry even though series creators Tarsier Studios has decided to move on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares III</a> instead comes to us from the horror specialists at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supermassive Games</a>, who have made a clear effort to recreate the look and feel of previous entries in the series. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Is Little Nightmares III a successful continuation of the franchise? Or is it time to wake from this recurring dream? Rub that sleep from your eyes and read on to find out...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the Little Nightmares series has always taken a wordless enigmatic approach to storytelling, the first two games offered more character development and hinted-at lore than you might expect. Supermassive at least partially resets the universe in Little Nightmares III, introducing two new mysterious protagonists, "Low" and "Alone," and some changes to the series' narrative structure that turns the "Little Nightmares" title into more of a literal statement. Overall, our new protagonists are likable enough, but some of the sense of intrigue and mystery that surrounded the first two Little Nightmares games is missing here.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In terms of gameplay, Supermassive doesn’t stray far from Tarsier’s blueprint. Little Nightmares III is a 2.5D platformer, with players having a relatively limited moveset, including the ability to jump, grab onto ledges and items, run, and crouch to sneak and fit through tight spaces. New to this game, each playable character now has a specific tool they carry with them at all times — Low has a bow that they can use to shoot things from afar, and Alone wields a wrench they can use to smash stuff and turn some cranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For the most part, Supermassive have very accurately replicated the feel of past Little Nightmares games, for better and worse. Character movement is very deliberate, which isn't a bad thing in a horror game, but platforming in particular can feel very inconsistent and "canned." There are times when the game's fixed camera angles and perspectives make it very difficult to properly judge jumps, with certain trouble spots causing me to die dozens of times (and I’ve been playing difficult platformers since the '80s). Thankfully, Supermassive<em> has </em>addressed Little Nightmares II's excruciatingly bad combat. It's still not <em>great </em>here, but both Low and Alone having their own dedicated weapons greatly reduces frustration.</p>



<p>Speaking of our dual protagonists, the other big thing Supermassive has added to Little Nightmares III is online co-op. Little Nightmares II took a The-Last-of-Us-like approach, with players relying on an AI-controlled partner to get past some obstacles, and you can still play that way in Little Nightmares III, but you can also now team up with an actual human. Due to the new co-op focus, Supermassive have included some puzzles and challenges that require some slightly more involved teamwork. Nothing too crazy — this isn't a Hazelight game — but you will need some coordination when playing with another person, which can be fun.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, these moments aren’t as satisfying when playing solo. Players pick Low or Alone at the beginning of a singleplayer run, and there’s no ability to switch back and forth between them. During some of the more complex team tasks, you simply do your side of the challenge and the AI will automatically do their side. Strictly speaking, this works, but it almost feels like cheating as your AI partner flawlessly completes their half of a puzzle. When your AI companion isn’t being overly competent, they’re often the opposite, getting lost behind or failing to zero in and do a simple thing you need to proceed. The AI always came around in the end for me, but not before some moments of irritation and wasted time.</p>



<p>Supermassive could also have done more to make co-op accessible to more people. Little Nightmares III can only be played online with folks on your friends list; there is no couch co-op, and your ability to communicate with your partner is very limited. That said, Little Nightmares III does include a Hazelight-style Friend Pass, allowing you to play with an online pal even if they don't own a copy of the game, so kudos for that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond the addition of co-op, Little Nightmares III feels very much like its predecessors, with its various sequences and set pieces sometimes feeling almost copy-pasted. Platform over rickety structures, crawl through various vents and tunnels, find skittery hiding nomes, tote around batteries to power devices, observe and sneak by various shambling monstrosities, run from those monstrosities in tense chase scenes, etc. If you’ve played past Little Nightmares games, you’ve done all this before. Little Nightmares III only summons up a couple of genuinely original sequences, which are saved for the game's final chapter. This finale hints at what Little Nightmares III <em>could </em>have been, but for most of the game's runtime, the game is merely fine. Arguably more fun and refined than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often-frustrating Little Nightmares II</a>, but rarely surprising.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also rarely all that scary. Earlier Little Nightmares titles were far from perfect, but they had a special <em>something</em>. The leathery Muppet-ey freaks that populated Tarsier's Little Nightmares games were uniquely off-putting, and while Supermassive tries their best to dream up their own atrocities, their creations don't quite measure up with many treading too close to generic creepy doll territory. Visually, Little Nightmares III also lacks some of the ambiance of the first two games, and even on PS5, it doesn't run quite as well as I'd like.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, despite the relatively negative tone of this review, Little Nightmares III does have its moments and can be fun with another human player. The game just doesn’t stand out in any particular way and with a relatively brief 4-hour runtime, this will likely be one of those dreams that fades from your mind not long after you wake up.</p>



<p><em>This review was based on a PS5 copy of Little Nightmares III provided by publisher Bandai Namco.</em></p>

						<section>
				<p>Little Nightmares III does a solid job of emulating the gameplay of earlier entries in the series, sometimes to a fault, but it doesn’t bring a whole lot else to the table and new developer Supermassive Games can’t quite pin down the eerie tone and creeping tension that made these games popular. While the ability to play online with others will appeal to some, it’s hard to escape the feeling that this series has officially gone from sleeper hit to just plain sleepy.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Familiar gameplay still mostly works
</li><li>Some memorable late-game moments
</li><li>Online co-op is a welcome addition
</li><li>Effectively icky sound effects</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Truly original ideas thin on the ground
</li><li>Not as uniquely creepy as the Tarsier games
</li><li>Lack of local co-op and other options
</li><li>A very quick playthrough</li>						</ul>

            <p>This week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch has arrived, firing some gear balancing tweaks into the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s innards, then probably dropping a cringey catchphrase. Developers Gearbox have also revealed some of what's in store for the larger patch that's set to arrive next week, with performance fixes back on the menu alongside some more in-depth balancing that'll touch "those unintended interactions" folks have been relying on for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psst-borderlands-4-has-a-pretty-broken-infinite-damage-build-and-it-may-soon-go-the-way-of-the-dodo">overpowered builds</a>.</p>
<p>It's all in the line with the nice rhythm the studio have settled into following an initial flurry of activity in response to the game running not goodly on PC out of the gate. Last week brought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-first-major-balancing-patch-is-out-now-delivering-beefy-vault-hunter-buffage-across-the-board">a big patch featuring the first round of vault hunter balancing tweaks</a>, so this week sees a chaser precede the next shot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re continuing to monitor feedback to the vault hunter changes and identifying areas to make further improvements," Gearbox wrote in <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">the notes for this chaser patch</a>, before listily outlining the following gear adjustage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby's Grasp damage increased by 50%</li>
<li>Ruby's Grasp fire rate increased by 25%</li>
<li>Bully drone damage increased by 50%</li>
<li>Bully base damage increased by 50%</li>
<li>Rangefinder base damage increase by 30%</li>
<li>Queen's Rest spawn chance increased from 30% to 50%</li>
<li>Queen's Rest fire rate increased by 50%</li>
<li>Seventh Sense orb damage increased by 250%</li>
<li>Hellwalker base damage increase 30%</li>
<li>Convergence base damage increase by 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of other tweaks. The legendary tediore shotgun anarchy will now properly award stacks of mutualism when auto-reloading or netting kills, every single pet now gets the appropriate chance of a critical hit from passives and gear, and Vex's bleed now counts as status effect damage. That last one sounds like it could be bad news for those exploity Vex knife builds, but even if it isn't, overpowered Vexers likely won't sleep well for the next seven days.</p><p>I say that because Gearbox have made clear next week's patch will "address unintended interactions in certain vault hunter skills, and make adjustments to overperforming gear", with Borderlands 4 director Graeme Timmins going as far as to phrase <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976321473041322127">a tweet about it</a> as a warning to those with overpowered builds. He's gotten some pushback from anti-nerfage campaigners, and responded by writing: "We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear."</p>
<p>Also teased for next week's patch were "another round of adjustments that will focus on class mods, repkits, shields, and firmware being tuned to provide greater viability for melee builds, and account for deficiencies in other specific vault hunter builds", and more stabs at improving the game's performance. In the meantime, maybe pen a poetic eulogy for Vex's boss-destroying knifeage, lest the heady days of its max bleeding be forgotten.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players have discovered that a fan-favourite aerial manoeuvre has been given its own dedicated dog tag, for those willing to leap from the safety of their aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>The Rendezook dog tag is awarded to players who manage to leap from the pilot seat of their jet, shoot down an enemy jet with a bazooka, then climb back into the safety of their own jet. The term is a blend of the words rendezvous and bazooka, describing the safe return of a player after using their bazooka for some daring rocket-to-plane action.</p>
<p>The Rendezook is a feat cemented in Battlefield history by its community, specifically by a player called Stun_Gravy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOaGhE_sejI">who posted a Battlefield 3 video</a> in which he performs the now-legendary Rendezook. That video went viral, and as such the challenge for other Battlefield players to reenact the move was established.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Dog Tags in Battlefield games are unlockable cosmetics, all of which require some pre-requisite achievement or challenge to be completed before you can wear them. You can steal another player's dog tags by taking them down in melee, but you can't wear these stolen tags. That means for the Rendezook dog tag - as well as all other prestigious tags - you'll have to do it yourself.</p><p>It means in your multiplayer games you could very well see some bozo try and fail over and over again to pull off a Rendezook in a public lobby, which hey, is part of the Battlefield charm. Seeing someone grab and waste a jet is about as classic a Battlefield moment as seeing a helicopter full of soldiers swan dive into the floor.</p>
<p>Speaking of Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review went live this week</a>. Reviewer Rick Lane wrote: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

            <p>A Minecraft Movie is getting a sequel and it's due out on 23rd July 2027.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the official Minecraft social media account with an image of two pickaxes. "Building terrain," the post teased.</p>
<p>News of a sequel is no surprise, in part due to the reveal in April a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">follow-up film was already in discussion</a>. The film's director Jared Hess teased where the film series could go next, pointing to a post-credits scene for clues.</p>

<p>But more so, A Minecraft Movie has been a phenomenal hit, even if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">critics weren't particularly impressed</a>.</p> <div>

<p>As we reported after its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie had the biggest domestic debut of any video game film adaptation ever in the US</a>, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m). Worldwide it made $301m (£233m) in that weekend.</p>
<p>Now, Deadline has reported the film has grossed almost $1bn since its release. A sequel, then, was inevitable.</p>
<p>The film became well-known for disruptive screenings thanks to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Chicken Jockey trend</a> of throwing popcorn all over cinemas. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-director-defends-popcorn-throwing-chicken-jockey-chaos-says-viewers-just-having-a-true-party">Hess called it "a total blast"</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">warning was retrospectively added</a> to the start of the film, along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-is-leaning-into-the-memes-with-sing-along-screenings">specific sing-along screenings</a>.</p>
<p>Where else could the film series go? Perhaps to The Far Lands, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-far-lands-over-14-years-later-the-edge-of-a-minecraft-world-has-been-reached">one Minecraft player has spent the past 14 years walking to</a>.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Fantastic Pixel Castle Studio Head and Game Director Greg Street <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7382143103379587072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed via LinkedIn</a> that the company's debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-wow-designer-founds-new-netease-studio-making-an-aaa-fantasy-mmo-codenamed-ghost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fantasy MMORPG codenamed Ghost</a>, is in serious danger. That's because NetEase, which had provided the initial funding, has decided to pull the plug. Both NetEase and Fantastic Pixel Castle have been looking for another publisher, but with the current market conditions, it's a very challenging proposition.</p>



<p>That's why Greg Street admitted that team members are already being encouraged to 'explore future opportunities' (that means looking at new jobs):</p>



<p><em>If we're unable to find a publisher soon, the reality is that the studio would likely close, and the entire team, leadership included, would be affected. We want to thank the Ghost community, our playtesters, and the literally hundreds of people who have given us advice on how to find funding in this absurdly challenging time for our industry. I hope you all will have a chance to play Ghost. I also want to thank the FPC team who has made a game that we all should be proud of. I know it's cliche to say this, but demonstrably this is the best team I have ever worked with. </em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We interviewed Greg Street</a> (previously, the Lead Systems Designer of World of Warcraft between 2008 and 2013) a couple of years ago, and the designer opened up on the upcoming MMO. The main twist of Ghost was supposed to be that players could hop between public 'Red' Shards, more akin to regular MMOs, and private 'Blue' Shards, which at first were supposed to offer survival elements but were then redesigned to support roguelike elements. </p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle is not the only developer to suffer from NetEase pulling the plug; <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-entertainment-is-a-new-netease-studio-founded-by-bioware-bethesda-mmo-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it already happened with T-Minus Zero</a>, a studio formed by former BioWare and Bethesda veterans, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other projects canceled earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Glenn Israel, a veteran of Halo Studios (previously 343 Industries) with more than 17 years under his belt in the universe, has departed the company and shared an ominous message on LinkedIn. In the message, he warns others in the industry about ‘staying strong and taking evidence’.</p>



<p>He also mentioned that he’s not able to talk about circumstances beyond a minor post, but said that next year, when it’s ‘absolutely safe to do so’, he’ll expand on his ‘story’.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-state-of-our-industry-seems-dire">‘The State of Our Industry Seems Dire’</h2>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Glenn Israel, former Art Director at 343 Industries (Halo Studios) wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe. There is litle more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year. In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.</p>



<p>I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are *free to choose*. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values – and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.</p>



<p>As always, I’ll be here if you need to talk.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s most likely that Israel finds himself under an NDA after leaving Halo Studios, which is common practice to ensure that, for a time, developers aren’t discussing what they were working on or why they were let go from (or left) a company.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenn-israel-19696485_as-of-today-and-after-seventeen-long-years-activity-7379767940897959936-btQc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post was published</a> over a week ago at the time of writing, but recently found its way into social circulations.</p>



<p>Recently, in the Halo space, it was claimed that a Halo: Combat Evolved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake was in co-development</a> by a Virtuos studio and is potentially set to be revealed during a Halo showcase at the Halo World Championship later this month.</p>
