            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/2024/6/20/24182415/elden-ring-cloth-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RRLtng">When you boot up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> for the first time, make sure you appreciate <em>Elden Ring’s</em> unsung hero: cloth.</p>
<p id="qfRRgP">FromSoftware has long been the master of dynamic cloth physics. That is, cloth that doesn’t follow a pre-set animation, but instead moves procedurally, based on an in-game physics engine.</p>
<p id="qnbM1D">It sounds simple, but it’s genuinely <em>really hard to do.</em></p>
<p id="sKjsgy">But FromSoftware has been doing it for years, and <em>Elden Ring</em> is just the latest and greatest manifestation of the studio’s cloth obsession. <em>Elden Ring</em>’s cloth isn’t just technically impressive, though. It communicates vital information about the world, and the characters that populate it.</p>
<p id="XvlPGi"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Take Mohg</a>, for example.</p>
<p id="91TlR1">He’s a messy boy who loves drama — and he’s dressed for it. The cape that he’s flung over his shoulders is a sumptuous red velvet, with a gold tassel fringe. </p>
<p id="PNhg35">“It’s very, quite literally in my opinion, theatrical,” visual artist Faith Schaffer pointed out in an interview. “It’s your classic red curtain with gold fringe.”</p>
<p id="FLIqAO">Mohg is the shunned child of the royal lineage, but instead of accepting a life in the sewers, he’s convinced himself he’s going to create his own dynasty. That plan somehow involves dressing like an absolute pimp and kidnapping his stepbrother. But really, he has one of the most baroque outfits in the game, which reads as extreme compensation for the royal treatment he was denied. He is putting on a show.</p>
<p id="PEEz6y">And FromSoftware always goes the extra mile when it creates dynamic cloth. The Godskin Duo are, yeah, wearing flesh. It looks disgusting, clammy, and blobby. It would be gross under any circumstances. But this flesh-cloth has its own physics parameters that cause it to flop and wobble. </p>
<p id="DN21kS">It’s a great example of how good FromSoftware is at using uniquely tuned physics to create distinct <em>movement</em>. If they had copied and pasted the same physics parameters they used for a velvet shawl or cotton cloak, it would still be distressing. But they went the extra mile and tuned the dangly bits of the robe to move with a distinct, cartilaginous wobble. </p>
<p id="WjpjJF">To learn more about how FromSoftware’s cloth contributes to the incredible worldbuilding of Elden Ring, <a href="https://youtu.be/wSSqx-Dh6ko">check out the video above</a>!

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While exploring the Tiderise Cliff area in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>, the Rover can get an extra amount of 20 Astrite by taking part in the Kitten’s Luck Lucky Draw. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">But although the system behind the draw is simple —you pay the 5x fish fee, pick a chest, and then open it for a chance of getting the prize— finding the latter can prove to be a little tricky. So that you can find it on your first try, here’s in which chest the Ultimate Prize is located on <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-ultimate-prize-chest-location-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Ultimate Prize Chest location in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">You can find the Ultimate Prize in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> by opening the Basic Supply Chest located by the stairs leading to the Lucky Draw area. The chest will be located by a wooden lamplight and be placed almost parallel to a Standard Supply Chest.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Upon opening the chest, the Treasure Store’s Hostess will show her surprise and close off her shop. Apart from the already mentioned 20 Astrite, you will also receive the following as part of the Ultimate Prize:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Three Wood Textured Shards</li> <li>6.000 Shell Credits</li> <li>30 Union EXP</li> <li>One to three Basic Energy Cores</li> <li>A random number of Basic, Medium, and Advanced Sealed Tubes </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-how-to-get-fish-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to get fish in Wuthering Waves</h3> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">The main way to get fish in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> can be done by catching them. You can do that by heading to any body of water and then either swimming or walking to them before pressing the gathering key/button. Although the fish in the game are pretty passive and will usually only move after you reach them, you can attack them beforehand to make the process easier. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">I was able to find a large quantity of fish in the waters surrounding the Kitten’s Luck. You can also find a consistent amount of it on the shallow pool housing the Bell-Borne Geochelone boss. Interestingly enough, Tetra is the only type of fish currently available in <em>WuWa</em>. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">If you are not in the mood to do the above, you can buy Fish from Mahe’s Grocery in Jinzhou. Each unit will cost 1.500 Shell Credits and you can purchase a maximum of 10 during each world rotation. Apart from its use on the draw, fish can also be used to make various recipes, such as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-milky-fish-soup-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milky Fish Soup</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="172" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of the LRG3 stream, <a href="https://youtu.be/PA2GwYOIqCw?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Limited Run Games revealed</a> that they’re pulling the two <em>Fighting Force </em>games together for a compilation. It will be arriving sometime in 2024.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Do you remember <em>Fighting Force</em>? The first one was released in 1997. Reportedly, Core Design pitched it to Sega for the Saturn as <em>Streets of Rage 3D</em>. Sega passed on it. As a result, it didn’t even release for the Saturn, instead arriving on PS1 and N64.</p> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Fighting Force Collection | LRG3 Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA2GwYOIqCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">It’s fun. It’s pretty loose. I don’t think anyone really had a good idea of how to do beat-’em-ups in 3D at the time, and this was no exception. Beyond just fisticuffs, there were also a lot of firearms. Honestly, I think what makes it stick out in my mind so much is its general vibe. There’s a real urban feel to its aesthetic that I love. The weirdest thing about it was that players had lives and limited continues, if I recall. Kind of a drag.</p>
 <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>Fighting Force 2</em> followed on PS1 and Dreamcast. I’m less familiar with this one because I had an N64 growing up. I’ve nearly bought the Dreamcast version on quite a few occasions in the last couple years. Contrary to the first game, the only footage I’ve seen of it takes place in some military complex. It’s also 1-player, what the hell? There’s no word if it’s the PS1 or Dreamcast version (or both) included in the collection. By the looks of it, it’s PS1.</p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">I’m down. They’re admittedly not great games, but I have enough affection for the era. I guess I’m saying that I really <em>want</em> to like them and am willing to attempt it again.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"><em>Fighting Force Collection</em> is coming sometime in 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="338" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Us Titan mains feel it: the tinge of disappointment in the new Prismatic subclass. We bemoan the absolute lunacy of Warlock and Hunter kits while we try to cobble together a functional build using what seem to be the worst Aspects from every subclass. But there’s still hope. We just got one of the best damage Exotics in the game. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-hazardous-propulsion" data-injectable="false">How to get Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">The… well I won’t say <em>easiest</em>, but the most optimal (and fun) way to get Hazardous Propulsion is to complete the Final Shape campaign on Legendary difficulty. At the very end, you’ll be given an extra reward: a choice between the two new Titan Exotics. One is the Strand-focused Wishful Ignorance gauntlets, the other is the chest armor Hazardous Propulsion. </p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Wishful Ignorance is great, but does it shoot rockets out of your shoulder blades? No? Skip it for now, because the <em>other</em> way to get these new Exotics is to reset your reputation rank with Rahool in the Tower, then focus-decode an Engram into one of them. So no matter which one you choose at the end of the campaign, you’ll be able to get the other a little way down the line. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-why-to-get-hazardous-propulsion" data-injectable="false"><em>Why</em> to get Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">So we’re skipping one really good Exotic for this one. Why? Well, Titans don’t exactly have excellent damage Supers, do they? What if we had access to amazing boss damage that didn’t require a Super <em>or</em> our guns? </p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">When you get kills or land precision shots, this chest piece will load rockets. Using your class ability (even Thruster, mind you) will launch up to six rockets, which hit for about 28k damage <em>each</em>. That’s pretty good already, but they also buff your rocket launcher and rocket pistols by 35% if you land all six. And that’s <em>nuts</em>. Before today’s patch, this buff is overwritten by Radiant (a 25% damage increase), but this has now been fixed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hazardous-propulsion-build-basics" data-injectable="false">Hazardous Propulsion build basics</h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">So, if you have this thing welded to your chest like I do, how do you make the most of it? Well, you’ll obviously want to use a rocket launcher in your heavy slot, and I’d suggest throwing a rocket pistol on as well. The Call, the new Strand sidearm from the Final Shape, suits this role perfectly, being kind of bonkers on its own. </p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">I’d also really suggest using Thruster, which unfortunately limits you to either an Arc or Prismatic subclass. I’d recommend Prismatic, since you’ll have a freer choice in Aspects and Fragments. The reason we’re using Thruster is its shorter cooldown and its lack of an animation: you’re going to be able to fire your buffed rockets a lot faster after casting it, and you’ll be shooting them more often. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false">As a “nice to have” bonus, I’d recommend a heavy rocket with Auto-Loading Holster or Reconstruction. This way you can pop off a heavy rocket, switch to The Call, then switch back near the tail-end of the buff’s lifespan to shoot another without having to stop to reload. The damage bonus to rockets can’t really be overstated, so it’s best to get as many shots in as you can while it’s up.</p>

<p data-characters="150" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The summer is stretching on, and though it’s got some games in the pipeline, it looks like Sony won’t be showing up to Gamescom this year.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">Sony will be not showcasing at the upcoming Gamescom 2024, as confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a>, reported first by <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-2024-sony-playstation-absage/">Games Wirtschaft</a>. This makes it five years since Sony showed up at a Gamescom, back in 2019.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s not the most surprising decision, it still comes as a disappointment for those hoping to see Sony’s games at the show, especially with how the PlayStation State of Play presentation in May was received by fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Sony had revealed release dates for <em>Concord</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and the <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> PC port during the State of Play, with all three titles set to launch this year. <em>Concord</em> will be released on August 23, which falls amid the dates for Gamescom 2024. Moreover, the release dates for <em>Astro Bot</em> (September 6) and <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> PC port (September 19) are also not that far off.</p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">However, PlayStation is not the only platform skipping the major video games showcase event, as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-is-skipping-gamescom-this-year-ruling-out-a-switch-2-reveal/">Nintendo</a> will also not be present at Gamescom 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">While both of those major console platforms will be a no-show, Xbox has doubled down on its commitment to Gamescom 2024. Xbox has announced that it will return for Gamescom this year, and will host its “biggest booth yet”.</p> <figure data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">Moreover, Xbox has also revealed some of the games and DLCs that they will be showcasing at Gamescom 2024. Fans can expect to hear about the following games and DLC:</p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></li> <li><em>Avowed</em></li> <li><em>Ara: History Untold</em></li> <li><em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em></li> <li><em>Diablo Immortal</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 76</em></li> <li><em>Towerborne</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em></li> </ul>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wizards of the Coast is launching two Secret Lair drops alongside the major<em> </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-universes-beyond-assassins-creed-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering </em>set</a>. These drops will contain ten unique cards that are perfect for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> and <em>MTG</em> fans or collectors alike, bringing characters and gear to life like never before. </p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Secret Lair drops compliment major set releases with incredible artwork, additional cards, or just alternate versions of cards that fans will find when they’re opening packs. Every drop is limited, meaning only those who purchase them when available or when stocks last will ever have them. As with every other Secret Lair drop, the <em>Assassin’s Creed: Lethal Legends and DaVinci’s Designs Superdrops</em> won’t be reprinted and will be a piece of <em>MTG</em> history you can own, play with, or keep in your collection forever. </p>
 <h2 id="h-every-card-in-the-secret-lair-x-assassin-s-creed-lethal-legends-and-davinci-s-designs-superdrops" data-injectable="false">Every card in the <em>Secret Lair x Assassin’s Creed: Lethal Legends and DaVinci’s Designs Superdrops</em></h2> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">As I mentioned above, there are ten cards in the <em>Secret Lair x Assassin’s Creed: Lethal Legends Superdrop</em>. These are split into two sets of five, so you can purchase either or both. I’m going to aim to get both because I love the shift in themes between the two. See below for the cards you’ll get in each set. </p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Both sets will be available from<strong> June 24, 2024, until July 14, 2024</strong>. Wizards of the Coast messed up the dates during the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uicFvwDDlBQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WeeklyMTG livestream</a> that revealed these cards, but Secret Lair confirmed the <a href="https://x.com/wizards_magic/status/1803141273118753054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct dates on Twitter</a>. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">These five cards are fairly straightforward and easy to understand. I have to say that Basim, Master Assassin sounds crazy and if you manage to pull off a win with his ability, then you’re a tactical genius. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Eivor, Raven Clan Champion</strong>: A 3/2 Legendary Creature and Human Warrior. Whenever a Warrior attacks, you can have its controller create a 1/1 white Warrior creature token that’s tapped while attacking. By paying one of each color mana, you can untap all attacking creatures. This also gives them Lifelink, Trample, and Haste until the end of the turn. After this phase, there will be an additional combat phase, but you can only activate this ability during combat. </li> <li><strong>Altair, Brotherhood Mentor</strong>: A 2/2 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-vigilance-in-magic-the-gathering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vigilance</a> and Haste. Gets +1/+1 for every experience counter you have. Tap to deal one damage to a creature you don’t control. When that creature dies this turn, you gain another experience counter. </li> <li><strong>Amunet, Tyrants’ End</strong>: A 3/3 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with Deathtouch and Haste. When Amunet, Tyrants’ End enters the battlefield, you become the monarch. At the beginning of your upkeep, if an opponent is the monarch, create a 1/1 black Assassin creature token with Deathrouch and Haste. </li> <li><strong>Basim, Master Assassin</strong>: A 4/4 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with Deathtouch. Other Assassins you control get +1/+1. whenever a player loses the game, if they were attacked this turn by an Assassin you controlled, you win the game. </li> <li><strong>Edward, Jackdaw Captain</strong>: A 3/3 Legendary Creature and Human Pirate. Other pirates you control get +1/+1. At the beginning of your end step, gain control of target nonland permanent controlled by a player who was dealt combat damage but three or more pirates this turn. </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-secret-lair-x-assassin-s-creed-davinci-s-designs-superdrop-cards" data-injectable="false">All <em>Secret Lair x Assassin’s Creed: DaVinci’s Designs Superdrop</em> cards</h3> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">These five cards are all equipment, so you’ll be using them alongside those Assassins above in the inevitable <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> decks you build. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Blade of Selves</strong>: A 2 mana Artifact Equipment. Equipped creature has Myriad. Equip 4. </li> <li><strong>Conqueror’s Flail</strong>: A 2 mana Artifact Equipment. Equipped creature gets +1/+1 for each color among the permanents you control. As long as Conqueror’s Flail is attached to a creature, your opponent can’t cast spells during your turn. Equip 2.</li> <li><strong>Darksteel Plate</strong>: A 3 mana Artifact Equipment with Indestructible. Equipped creature has Indestructible. Equip 2. </li> <li><strong>Deathrender</strong>: A 4 mana Artifact Equipment. Equipped creature gets +2/+2. Whenever equipped creature dies, you may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield and attach Deathrender to it. Equip 2. </li> <li><strong>Whispersilk Cloak</strong>: A 3 mana Artifact Equipment. Equipped creature can’t be blocked and has Shroud. Equip 2.</li> </ul>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-latest-season-is-as-chaotic-as-the-media-that-inspired-it.907083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="O2vFWC">Chapter 5 Season 3 of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is utterly overwhelming. The first time I dropped from the Battle Bus and onto the deserted lands of Brawler’s Battleground, I couldn’t tell up from down. The stadium — which is designed to look like a monster truck rally venue — comes equipped with flamethrowers, live rock music, and stacks of spinning rip blades. After winning a desperate scramble with other players and scattered AI bots, I didn’t stop to shield up and heal. Instead, I went into my menu and turned the sound down. </p>
<p id="XpUcJj">As it turns out, that flurry of activity in those opening moments came to characterize the general vibe of <em>Fortnite</em>’s latest big update. Dubbed “Wrecked,” this season pushes <em>Fortnite </em>away from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23990967/fortnite-chapter-5-season-1-map-too-fancy">posh European locales</a> and instead creates an anarchic wasteland inspired by the likes of the Fallout games and, seemingly, Mad Max. Take those two franchises as starting inspiration points, then layer on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177794/metallica-stage-fortnite-festival-new-season">hefty serving of Metallica on top</a>, and the results are a gameplay experience that’s caked in chaotic sludge — so much so that it might weigh down the fun at some points. </p>
<p id="VqjJZX">The update is absolutely littered with new items. There are the Nitro Fists, which can melee through even the fiercest opponents with an explosion of power. There’s a new set of Medallions, which you pick up after boss fights and use to give yourself powerful buffs. There are the Lockjaw battle cars, which can plow through anything and contain mounted turrets. </p>
<p id="hs8fhI">If you don’t get one of the battle cars, that’s fine, because the map is literally covered with other vehicles you can modify, Flaming Boost Hoops that can send you zooming across the map (or into another player, if you so wish), and items like the Ride the Lightning guitar that allow you to soar through the sky. If you yourself want to become a weapon, no problem. The plentiful Nitro Splash allows your character to run through buildings and destroy them with a simple jump into the Splash. </p>

<p id="tQ55b0">This results in moments that feel either bad to lose or worse to win. I had one moment where I was just chilling on a mountain, looting a chest, when a player came up from the other side of the hill. I panicked and spammed the Nitro Fists and won with little to no finesse. </p>
<p id="5ledYD">At one point, I tried to attack an opponent driving a car and I missed. I backed up like a mom driving her kids to soccer in a minivan and missed again. I then looped around to try to hit them again and indeed I did. It landed enough damage that I could hop out and clean up the kill with a bit of gunfire. On the flip side, I was once looting a building quietly until someone amped up on Nitro Splash boosted through the entire building and yeeted me to another dimension, leading me to take some fall damage and making for an easy kill from their teammate in a car. </p>
<p id="AtX0bI">For better or worse, the developers successfully captured the spirit of anarchy this season. If you’re a casual player who just wants to mess around with friends, the pace of each match can ramp up in the blink of an eye as vehicles descend upon you and smash you to smithereens. If you play competitively, it’s less enjoyable — I’ve seen many posts online lamenting the sheer number and strength of new gimmicks at play here. My regular partner in duos has already decided he’s going to sit this season out based on a few play sessions. I don’t blame him, because it’s a lot, and a constantly irritated fan base appears to be the new norm for <em>Fortnite</em>. However, I can’t help but feel it’s all still very, well... <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>

<p id="7FXV4g">This is the same team that decided to take building, the titular and most original game mechanic in the game, and make it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23271397/fortnite-zero-build-battle-royale">an optional feature</a>. We’ve gotten <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23308196/fortnite-goku-dragon-ball-super-emote-dance">Dragon Ball powers</a> in the game, the ability to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124335/avatar-last-airbender-fortnite-atla-characters-zuko-toph-katara">bend all four elements</a>, and more. Do I miss the slightly slower-paced matches of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952544/fortnite-og-map-zero-build-impressions">OG map as a Zero Build player</a>? Sure, but <em>Fortnite </em>has often had a Mario Kart blue shell logic to it all — that is, that any person can swoop in and win at the last moment — and that helps keep the game interesting to players of all levels. At the moment, it feels like the balance may be tipped a bit too far toward chaos. </p>

For the most part, posts in the <em>Helldivers </em>subreddit have been pretty tame though, which might honestly be due to the goodwill of the last big patch to hit the game. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>used to have frequent patches and fixes that seemed to solve one issue and cause several more, which eventually added up over the course of several months.

I guess I’d call this less of a leak and more of a strategic tease, and it seems like it’s done the trick.

<p>In June 2023, Asus released the ROG Ally worldwide and forever changed the playing field where handheld gaming devices were concerned. Following in the ever-so-successful footsteps of Valve’s Steam Deck, Asus cornered a fair portion of the market by introducing a Windows 11-powered device with a white-hot processor and a gorgeous aesthetic – but it wasn’t without its teething issues.</p>



<p>Fast forward an entire year and the Asus ROG Ally is still at the top of the table – but it has been joined by some tough competition. In the last few months, the Lenovo Legion Go and the MSI Claw have entered the battlefield, and even a <strong>new </strong>ROG Ally model has surfaced – the ‘ROG Ally X’. </p>



<p>One year on, is the Asus ROG Ally still worth your money?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-powerful-playing">Powerful Playing</h2>



<p>With a Windows 11 OS as standard, the Asus ROG Ally is and forever will be a versatile and highly dynamic device. If you were to pair it with a wireless keyboard and mouse, you’ve got yourself a low-powered gaming PC. It can run more or less any launcher, and while some games are finicky in terms of compatibility, almost anything can be played on the device. It also supports every application you can install on a laptop or a PC, which is another huge bonus.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with the Asus ROG Ally for a few months, and it’s so rare that I’ve had a bad experience. The biggest drawback is the unit’s battery, which flakes out after playing a ‘good’ game for more than 45 minutes. On charge, you can boost the ROG Ally into ‘Turbo Mode’ and keep playing for hours, but then you’ll need to contend with a little heat source in the palms of your hands.</p>



<p>From Fallout 4 to Escape from Tarkov and from Modern Warfare 3 to Days Gone, I’ve played quite a mix of games on the Asus ROG Ally. It’s a powerful device considering its size, but on plenty of occasions, I had to drop the quality of these games right down to the bottom to produce a stable and consistent experience – but that’s not a huge issue, as almost everything looks good on the 1080p, 7-inch touchscreen (which boasts a 120hz refresh rate).</p>



<p>The AMD RDNA-powered GPU and the 16 GB of RAM are enough to run most modern games, but the upgraded model is the one to go for if you want the best experience possible. In the Asus ROG Ally X, there’s a 1 TB NVMe SSD and 24 GB of RAM, plus a battery that boasts twice as much power.</p>



<p>However, the original Asus ROG Ally can still use the ROG XG Mobile eGPU to take advantage of the equivalent of an RTX 3070 GPU, while the ROG Ally X <strong>cannot</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-getting-to-grips">Getting to Grips</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In your hands, the Asus ROG Ally still feels very nice, even after months of use. It’s a sleek device that has a nice splash of RGB front and centre, which appeals to the gamer in all of us. The face buttons are a good size and are tactile, and the whole setup is made to mimic an Xbox or a PlayStation controller, right down to the sloped triggers and large, curved shoulder buttons. The thumbsticks are ‘full-sized’ and grippy, and the additional buttons that are there to accommodate extra inputs plus shortcuts to the onboard software are run-of-the-mill but on-theme.</p>



<p>With a stereo speaker setup boasting Dolby Atmos, the included sound system is decent enough, but I paired the ROG Ally with a Bluetooth headset to get the best experience possible. </p>



<p>Now that the ROG Ally X is on the market, you should be able to land a good deal on the Asus ROG Ally OG unit, but it’s best to get in quickly before stock dries up forever. It’s a solid gaming machine with fantastic multi-tasking potential, and it’s easily one of the best-looking devices out of the bunch when sat alongside the Lenovo Legion Go, the MSI Claw, or the Steam Deck. Even a year after launch, I still find myself using it a few times a week when travelling or simply lounging on the sofa and not wanting to drag myself to my PC.</p>



<p>I’ll keep hold of my ROG Ally until it gives up on me, basically.</p>

All of the games have been carefully updated for modern PCs and consoles using Limited Run’s proprietary Carbon Engine. Along the way the team was able to smooth out some of the games’ rough edges.</p><p>At the helm of the project is Limited Run’s Audi Sorlie, a producer, author, Bubsy World Heavyweight Champion and arguably the world’s foremost expert on the furry franchise. Together with the team at Limited Run and Atari, he has created the ultimate retrospective celebration of Bubsy, the 3’6” tall 80 pound bobcat (with a pet armadillo named Arnold).

It allows Limited Run to put out highly accurate, emulation-based ports of classic games for modern hardware. Old, well-loved releases can find a second wind on all-new hardware using the Carbon Engine.

                <p>Former Dragon Age series executive producer and current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> consultant Mark Darrah says that The Veilguard marks the first entry in the series with combat that's legitimately enjoyable.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I see in Veilguard is a game that finally bridges the gap," Darrah said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/18/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-combat-abilities-skill-tree-and" rel="nofollow ">Game Informer</a>. "Uncharitably, previous Dragon Age games got to the realm of 'combat wasn't too bad.' In this game, the combat's actually fun, but it does keep that thread that's always been there. You have the focus on Rook, on your character, but still have that control and character coming into the combat experience from the other people in your party."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike previous entries in the series, The Veilguard's combat system is focused on real-time combat, with tactical combat taking a bit of a backseat. Players can only take two companions with them at a time (down from three in previous titles) and can no longer directly control those companions in combat. Instead, players can pause time by pulling up an ability wheel that allows them to choose which ability they want to use next, and also select which actions their companions take in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare general manager Gary McKay echoed Darrah's statements, adding, "I've seen [The Veilguard's combat system] refined over time, [and] I love it. I love that balance of real-time fluid action, but also the ability to have the depth in the RPG, not just in terms of pause-and-play, but the depth in terms of how you bring your companions into the battlefield. What are you going to do with their skill points? What's the loadout you're going to use? Everything is about bringing Rook to the center of the battlefield, and I love it."</p><p>The Veilguard is set to release sometime in Fall 2024.

<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Money is what it’s all about in the real world, but also in <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>. While you can complete endless heists to earn more cash or perhaps just steal it from pedestrians, you can also take your existing money to Wall Street and invest in the in-game stocks. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Stocks are a great way to easily amass a fortune to buy as many <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-sell-cars-in-gta-5/">cars</a>, planes, and boats as you want. Better yet, they can be manipulated by in-game choices during the story, in both the BAWSAQ and LCN when you’re playing story mode. What are the best stocks to invest in when you’re playing <em>GTA 5</em>? We’re here to let you know.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gta-5-liberty-city-national-stock-exchange.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rockstar </figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Rockstar </figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Rockstar </figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-stocks-earn-you-the-most-money-in-gta-5" data-injectable="false">What stocks earn you the most money in GTA 5?</h2> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">These are the top stocks you can buy into when you’re playing <em>GTA 5</em>. When played correctly, they have the highest return rate. These should be used in tandem with Lester’s Assassination Missions since they specifically target important figures in the market, like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-register-as-ceo-in-gta-5-guide/">CEOs</a>, to manipulate the market how you want. You’ll get the most return when you invest in these properly:</p> <h3 id="h-1-betta-pharmaceuticals" data-injectable="false">1. Betta Pharmaceuticals</h3> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">Betta Pharmaceuticals is the company you’ll want to invest in during The Hotel Assassination, specifically on the BAWSAQ. Make sure to invest in the company before you start the mission to get the best return.&nbsp;It will return the highest rate right when the assassination is complete.</p>
 <h3 id="h-2-debonaire" data-injectable="false">2. Debonaire </h3> <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Much like Betta, you’ll want to invest in this company before you start The Multi-Target Assassination. However, make sure to do it on the LCN instead. This is how you’ll get the most cash when it’s time to sell the stock back.</p> <h3 id="h-3-fruit-computers" data-injectable="false">3. Fruit Computers</h3> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Fruit Computers is best invested in before The Vice Assassination mission begins. When you do this, make sure to invest money with all three characters for the best return. You’ll also want to invest in the BAWSAQ for this stock.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-gold-coast" data-injectable="false">4. Gold Coast</h3> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false">Gold Coast should, once again, be bought into right before you begin the mission, The Construction Assassination. Buy into the Gold Coast stock specifically on the LCN for the best return.</p> <h3 id="h-5-bilkinton-research" data-injectable="false">5. Bilkinton Research</h3> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Bilkinton is a bit different, as you won’t want to invest in this stock until <em>after</em> you finish the mission, specifically The Hotel Assassination. You get the best results when you invest it right after you sell the stock from Betta. Invest in Bilkinton on the LCN.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-redwood-cigarettes" data-injectable="false">6. Redwood Cigarettes </h3> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Once again you’ll want to invest this after you’ve sold your stock that you invested before you begin The Multi-Target Assassination, which is Debonaire. Once the mission is completed, invest in Redwood on the LCN. This stock is the most important since you’ll get the most return for your work. If you’re going to invest in only one stock, make it Redwood Cigarettes.</p> <h3 id="h-7-facade" data-injectable="false">7. Façade</h3> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">Buy into Façade after you complete The Vice Assassination. For this stock, you will want to invest on the BAWSAQ exchange for the best return.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-vapid" data-injectable="false">8. Vapid</h3> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">The final stock you’ll want to invest in to make money is Vapid. Put your money into this stock on the BAWSAQ after you’ve completed The Bus Assassination to get the most money in return.</p> <h2 id="h-when-should-you-sell-your-stock-in-gta-5" data-injectable="false">When should you sell your stock in GTA 5?</h2> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">When you should sell your stock is dependent on which stock you invested in, between the LCN and BAWSAQ. Here’s what you need to know about both:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>LCN: </strong>This stock will peak in value a day after you complete the assassination mission or 24 in-game hours. It will begin to decline after that point but will go back up to peak value around a week after the assassination. Any time after this will be lower than the maximum return you can get on it.</li> <li><strong>BAWSAQ: </strong>This stock goes up faster, peaking directly after the assassination is complete. After 24 in-game hours, the price will begin to decline. It will bounce back about two or three days after the assassination mission again but will go back down afterward.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">If you follow the rules of which stock to sell and when and where to sell it, you’ll be able to make quite a fortune. This is by far the best method to interact with stocks in <em>GTA 5</em> and guarantees you a good return. Stocks are a great way to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-money-fast-in-gta-5/">make money</a>, however, I recommend pulling off these market manipulations when you have more cash to get a higher return. </p>

<p data-characters="425" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the Monopoly Games seasons starting today in <em>Monopoly GO</em>, we have several sports-related features to enjoy, with the Fortune Footrace banner event being one of many new additions. With the opportunity to get plenty of stickers for an early start on the new season’s album sets, you may very well get lucky and finish a few in one fell swoop. Let’s check out the entire list of Fortune Footrace event rewards.</p>  <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Fortune Footrace event has 44 rewards you can obtain until June 22, 2024. Collecting enough points to complete every tier rewards you with 19,615 dice and 14 sticker packs, making this a solid opportunity to obtain more cards than usual. Below is every Fortune Footrace event reward.</p> <figure data-found-rows="44" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="2363" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Event Level</th><th>Points Required</th><th data-align="center">Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr data-index="0"><td>1</td><td>5</td><td data-align="center">One-Star Sticker Pack</td></tr><tr data-index="1"><td>2</td><td>10</td><td data-align="center">30 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="2"><td>3</td><td>15</td><td data-align="center">Cash</td></tr><tr data-index="3"><td>4</td><td>60</td><td data-align="center">75 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="4"><td>5</td><td>20</td><td data-align="center">One-Star Sticker Pack</td></tr><tr data-index="5"><td>6</td><td>20</td><td data-align="center">15 minutes of Mega Heist</td></tr><tr data-index="6"><td>7</td><td>5</td><td data-align="center">60 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="7"><td>8</td><td>30</td><td data-align="center">Two-Star Sticker Pack</td></tr><tr data-index="8"><td>9</td><td>200</td><td data-align="center">250 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="9" data-injectable="true"><td>10</td><td>30</td><td data-align="center">Cash</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">

 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">Since there are more sticker packs than usual during this event, you have two possible strategies: progressing as quickly as possible to wrap up your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-making-music-album-stickers-and-rewards-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making Music album sets</a> or wait a few minutes for the new season to roll by. Either way, there are more dice, card packs, and power-up rewards than usual, with the required points also being much lower than previous banner events of a similar nature.</p>
  <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">Gaining points during the Fortune Footrace event requires landing on Chance, Community Chest, and Railroad tiles. Below is the points breakdown for each:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"> <li>Chance: Two points</li> <li>Community Chest: Three points</li> <li>Railroad: Five points</li> </ul> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="false">The best tile you can land on is the railroad space. Not only does it reward the most points toward this event, but you’ll also gain progress toward ongoing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-row-rally-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tournaments like Row Rally</a>. Chance is a close second, as it can send you to the nearest railroad. Take advantage of dice rewards and power-ups like High Roller to increase your dice limits as the points from these tiles scale with your dice multiplier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thanks-to-ai-clementine-can-finally-remember-that<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has adopted what it calls a “human-centric approach to AI in games,” as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/embracer-rolls-out-new-ai-policy-to-massively-enhance-game-development-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a>. The policy, laid out in the company’s <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual report</a>, is all the greatest hits of the dumbest ideas about our dumbest tech craze, made by the dumbest guys you know.</p><p>First off: if anyone knows less about “human-centric” approaches to anything, it’s Embracer, the company that gobbled up a chunk of the games industry and then flushed it down the toilet, closing studios, cancelling games, and laying off employees at a breakneck pace since that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saudi money fell through</a>. <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humans have been paying the price</a> for the company’s fuck-ups since; I sincerely doubt that the ethical concerns it professes to see with AI are the thing that’s suddenly going to make it pivot into, you know, giving a shit about people. Embracer writes that “We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” a goal it could meet without any bullshit technology by just letting people keep their jobs, but where’s the fun in that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Embracer writes that “one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players.” This is arguably true, in that as every company jumps off the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI cliff</a>, Embracer wouldn’t want to miss out on the chance to join the lemming herd. What does it see as these advantages? The usual bullshit: “scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, and more.”&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s my favorite part:</p><blockquote><p>And, as models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time. That makes the whole gaming experience much more interesting and lifelike.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Groundbreaking! We’ve definitely never had a game be able to r<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/35lr3h/where_does_will_remember_that_come_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emember what you’ve done</a> in previous situations before. How would developers ever be able to <a href="https://x.com/qorquiq/status/1803816368896135675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code something so complicated</a> without the help of AI, a technology that can’t do any of the things it promises it can <em>yet</em>, but which can only get there if we keep <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tinkerbell clapping</a> for it despite the <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence</a>. If we stay the course, if we keep pumping money and hype into the plagiarism machine, if companies of all kinds keep <a href="https://futurism.com/washington-post-pivot-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoting</a> their <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ea-studios-hunger-to-start-using-generative-ai-as-quickly-as-possible-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">models</a> to embrace it (sorry), at some unspecified point in the future, Embracer will be able to lead the way in a technology that was a <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-Telltale-Games-what-does-it-mean-when-it-says-X-character-will-remember-that" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme</a> in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Embracer has been at the forefront of bad decisions, innovating new horrors in both games industry consolidation and the destruction that comes from that consolidation. I’m heartened to see that it won’t be left in the dust on this either. Good luck to everyone involved!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></span></span></p><p><time datetime="2024-06-20T18:19:06.457Z"> <!-- -->Jun 20, 2024, 6:19 PM UTC</time></p><div><h2>Share this story</h2></div></div></div><div><div><p><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> was Ubisoft’s breakout hit of 2003, but the company’s cult classic <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, released just two weeks later, will beat it to an upgraded rerelease. Ubisoft has released a trailer for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition </em>that confirms it’ll arrive next Tuesday, June 25th — just five days after I write these words. </p><p>I hope it stands up because I remember it as a phenomenal game. Jade and her pig buddy Pey’j were memorable characters with a remarkably lived-in sci-fi world, where you wield a camera and a mean stick rather than resorting to gunplay. It struck enough of a chord that gamers have been clamoring for a sequel ever since — but <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> has now been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557146/beyond-good-and-evil-2-not-canceled-development-hell">stuck in development hell</a> for 15 years, longer than even the infamous <em>Duke Nukem Forever.</em></p><div><figcaption><em>The camera is your most important tool in BG&amp;E.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div><p>Here’s how Ubisoft’s trailer description describes the <em>20th Anniversary Edition</em> remaster:</p><div><blockquote><p>Embark on this epic adventure in up to 4K, 60fps with improved graphics, controls and audio. Explore the anniversary gallery, and discover more about Jade’s childhood in the new treasure hunt! </p></blockquote></div><p>The trailer also mentions a “reorchestrated soundtrack.” Last year, we were also told it would have autosave and cross-save features, which could make it a good bit more pick up and play than the original, since 2003 was still the era of save points in video games. I’ll probably play it handheld! </p><p>We knew the remaster was coming — Ubisoft even accidentally released an unfinished version of the game last November and was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23980960/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-2024">forced to confirm its existence early</a>! And earlier today, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-officially-unveiled-in-since-deleted-ubisoft-tweet">it deleted a tweet</a> that accidentally revealed the June 25th release date, too. <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-psn/trophies/">The game’s trophies leaked</a> earlier this month. And Ubisoft also appears to have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/beyond-good-evil-delisted-ahead-of-20th-anniversary-editions-reveal-this-week/">delisted the original game from Steam</a>, though — as usual — existing owners like me can still download it just fine. Let me know if you see that change. </p><div><p>Meanwhile, the <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</em>, which should be a ground-up redo rather than a remaster and has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">also seen its share of delays and even complete development reboots</a>, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175567/the-sands-of-time-is-still-alive">now coming in 2026</a>.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>Update, June 20th: </strong>I had forgotten that BG&amp;E also got </em><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/beyond_good__evil_hd/b/xbox360/archive/2011/03/01/take-a-chance-on-this.aspx"><em>a digital-only HD remaster in 2011</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181027/netflix-house-retail-dallas-king-of-prussia-2025"><h2>Netflix House will fill the voids left by dead department stores</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181870/openai-former-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-ssi-safe-superintelligence"><h2>OpenAI’s former chief scientist is starting a new AI company</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><h2>Zelda is finally getting her own game</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180340/apple-pay-later-shutting-down-months-after-launch"><h2>Apple is shutting down Apple Pay Later just months after launch</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181214/eu-chat-control-law-propose-scanning-encrypted-messages-csam"><h2>EU chat control law proposes scanning your messages — even encrypted ones</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182478/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-fan-art-memes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CR8mSd">Nintendo has revealed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">Princess Zelda will lead as the playable protagonist</a> in the newly announced game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>. Instead of swinging the iconic Master Sword, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">Zelda wields the Tri Rod</a>, a magical tool that can allow her to replicate items and creatures from the larger environment. Now, anything from a wooden table to a monster can be summoned by Zelda to explore the world, solve puzzles, and fight. </p>
<p id="lra3Nv">Using materials in unexpected ways isn’t exactly anything new for The Legend of Zelda fans.    If anything, the sandbox elements of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23718684/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-switch-totk"><em>Tears of Kingdom</em></a><em> </em>already pushed this way of playing to the max. Anything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">a pile of logs</a> to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/13xxxjs/did_you_know_that_you_can_attach_icy_meat_to_your/">frozen slab of meat</a> could be viable materials for building zany contraptions. However, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>revives the charm and humor of using unconventional tools to save Hyrule. Mainly, it’s just great to think about the princess aggressively saving Link from his death by wielding nothing but a chair and a kitchen table. </p>
<p id="5GzQpy">Now fans have filled X with posts and fan art celebrating the protagonist and her newfound set of magical powers. This first piece of art portrays the enormous potential of “table power,” but you can scroll on to see more. </p>







<p id="UP0fqi">Based on the gameplay demonstration shown on Tuesday, Zelda needs to be able to see and scan an item first with her rod before she can replicate it. I don’t think there are any guns in Hyrule, but that hasn’t stopped fans from fans imagining what could happen if she were able to create one.</p>


<p id="y6EiHs">Part of the trailer showed Zelda carrying a hefty rock, so a lot of the art reimagines the moment where the tiny princess picks up the large boulder. </p>


<p id="FyK1QV">And then if good old goofs and memes are your game, well there are already plenty of those too. Here are two of the funniest ones we found. </p>


<p id="i23voC"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is coming out on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26.  </p>

<h3 id="cOljqr"><strong>New Map: Runasapi</strong></h3>
<p id="Fy2ka8">Hike your way up the new Runasapi Push map, to a town hidden high in the Peruvian Andes. Amble through marketplaces full of fresh produce and pay a visit to the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. This exciting Push map is vibrant and challenging as you escort TS-1 through tight streets. Watch out as some fights may take place precariously close to the steep cliffs overlooking the sunny farmlands below.</p>
<h3 id="KnYvBD"><strong>Challenge Updates</strong></h3>
<p id="gFIXts"><strong>Weekly Challenge Catch Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="nzz8Mb">All past incomplete Weekly Challenges can be completed at any time in a given season.</li>
<li id="cbVNcW">When the Weekly Reset occurs on Tuesdays, incomplete Weekly Challenges gain an additional copy of that challenge. When a Weekly Challenge is completed, if that challenge has copies remaining, the Challenge will refresh and can be completed again.</li>
</ul>
<p id="TLcYth"><strong>Weekly Milestones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="AG0C4I">Weekly Milestones are challenges progressed by completing other Weekly Challenges.</li>
<li id="H78M8v">Each week, a new Weekly Milestone is unlocked. All past Weekly Milestones can be completed at any time in a given season.</li>
<li id="oTdEFP">Weekly Milestones progress one at a time. All past Weekly Milestones must be completed to progress a Weekly Milestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Qn6gA1"><strong>Competitive Play Updates</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="MIMa9T">Rank Percentage is now displayed on the Competitive Progress page allowing you to check your exact percentage without playing another match.</li>
<li id="TWx4dP">Renamed the Modifiers “Win Streak” and “Loss Streak” to “Win Trend” and “Loss Trend” to more accurately convey that these modifiers are calculated by weighing the most recent games more heavily, but that they are not true streaks.</li>
<li id="HwbENL">Added more parameters for how the matchmaker handles wide groups, so that it can ensure better queue times.</li>
<li id="G5qnyN">A button that allows you to view the match’s final Scoreboard has been added to each page during the end-of-game flow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qE696k"><strong>Hero Updates</strong></h3>
<h4 id="TRTQzC"><strong>General</strong></h4>
<ul><li id="EriyHW">Knockdown time when two charging abilities collide reduced from 2 to 1.7 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="uFBbKH"><em>Developer Comments: This stun time reduction applies to the knockdown that happens when two charging abilities collide and result in a tie (with Reinhardt, Doomfist, Brigitte, Mauga, Bob). The counterplay and interaction of two charging abilities impacting each other is great, but it took both players out of the fight a little too long.</em></p>
<h4 id="tpA2h9"><strong>Tank</strong></h4>
<p id="U1cObz"><strong>D.Va</strong></p>
<p id="gpCgp5">Boosters</p>
<ul><li id="1QARct">Impact damage increased from 15 to 25.</li></ul>
<p id="EitHDk">Fusion Cannons</p>
<ul><li id="wG2PLp">Weapon spread reduced from 3.75 to 3.375 degrees.</li></ul>
<p id="tZBRsO"><em>Developer Comments: These changes will improve D.Va’s effectiveness against smaller targets as she became less effective against armored enemies in the previous patch.</em></p>
<p id="73GHwc"><strong>Junker Queen</strong></p>
<p id="7jbpS2">Rampage</p>
<ul><li id="UeNGlR">Startup time reduced from 0.75 to 0.5 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="Ni6H4N">Jagged Blade</p>
<ul><li id="5BuGAO">Now pulls tanks further.</li></ul>
<p id="cnBI6z"><em>Developer Comments: The Tank knockback resistance passive was affecting Junker Queen’s pull effect more than intended. The distance can be affected by their movement, but Tanks are now pulled in about 5-6 meters instead of only 3 meters or so.</em></p>
<p id="CX6CAN"><strong>Orisa</strong></p>
<p id="pVz6FB">Javelin Spin</p>
<ul><li id="7I8uEW">Cooldown reduced from 9 to 8 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="SJpIuH"><em>Developer Comments: Orisa’s survivability was reduced more than necessary in her last round of changes so we’re partially reverting the cooldown increase to Javelin Spin.</em></p>
<p id="FFPpVy"><strong>Roadhog</strong></p>
<ul><li id="SNTbMk">Base health reduced from 650 to 600.</li></ul>
<p id="2I5VMq">Take a Breather</p>
<ul><li id="nPO7KB">Damage reduction reduced from 50% to 40%.</li></ul>
<p id="Y84hNM"><em>Developer Comments: Roadhog’s already-powerful survivability increased significantly with the headshot damage reduction from the tank role passive so these changes are to help bring that back in line.</em></p>
<h4 id="XnAMqM">Damage</h4>
<p id="kqLp3Q"><strong>Cassidy</strong></p>
<p id="jaGoRR">Flashbang</p>
<ul>
<li id="c0ZJKk">Magnetic Grenade ability is now Flashbang.</li>
<li id="wA7PFn">Hinders enemies instead of Stunning them for 1.2 seconds.</li>
<li id="NdsMNL">Movement speed reduction increased from 30% to 50%.</li>
<li id="0WYdRD">Hinder now prevents crouching movement.</li>
<li id="J5rhVX">45 explosive damage.</li>
<li id="AviSwm">12 second cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Va7LOZ">Deadeye</p>
<ul>
<li id="BfpfLN">Movement speed penalty now scales down over time, from 70% to 35%.</li>
<li id="G1dPqd">Damage reduction now scales down over time, from 40% to 0%.</li>
</ul>
<p id="zlSSfz">Combat Roll</p>
<ul><li id="qo9HaG">Damage reduction reduced from 75% to 50%.</li></ul>
<p id="NFtYP1">Peacekeeper</p>
<ul><li id="BWmTYT">Secondary fire “Fan the Hammer” damage reduced from 50 to 45.</li></ul>
<p id="IuKmiM"><em>Developer Comments: We’re reverting the Magnetic Grenade ability to be deployed like Cassidy’s previous Flashbang ability, but it will keep the Hinder effect instead of a full stun. We’ve heard feedback surrounding the Magnetic Grenade ability and agree that while the fantasy of a homing grenade was fun, the moment-to-moment gameplay of it often felt too unpredictable as to whether it would land or not. The Hinder effect has been a useful tool to act as a counter to highly mobile heroes without going back to a full stun and the enemy player losing the ability to fight back.</em></p>
<p id="UaPTCS"><em>The Deadeye ultimate is getting an adjustment to increase its flexibility toward the end of its duration, enabling it to get value outside of buying time for Cassidy or his allies, though it may be riskier to hold it for a long time as the damage reduction will fade away along with the movement speed penalty.</em></p>
<p id="d662B5"><strong>Mei</strong></p>
<p id="vYfCU4">Endothermic Blaster</p>
<ul>
<li id="xK0Bvf">Secondary fire base projectile size reduced from 0.15 to 0.12 meters.</li>
<li id="pGItN3">Secondary fire damage increased from 75 to 85.</li>
</ul>
<p id="KPItKb"><em>Developer Comments: Mei’s damage output over time is intended to be on the low end for a Damage hero, as she offers strong utility and survivability through her ability kit, but we would like to make the secondary fire icicle more rewarding by increasing the damage and slightly more difficult to land consistently.</em></p>
<p id="aOAH0a"><strong>Reaper</strong></p>
<p id="v1LhpF">Hellfire Shotguns</p>
<ul><li id="Q9pD3p">Weapon spread reduced from 6.5 to 6 degrees.</li></ul>
<p id="WDruLK">Shadow Step</p>
<ul><li id="azKZOP">Cast time reduced from 1.5 to 1.2 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="X5sCSK"><em>Developer Comments: With the previous patch change to how armor reduces damage, shotgun weapon heroes like Reaper lost some value since much of their game plan revolved around pressuring large tank heroes. To help shift Reaper toward being more effective against smaller targets we’re tightening the weapon spread on the Hellfire Shotguns and reducing the amount of time enemies have to react to his Shadow Step teleport.</em></p>
<p id="fujuZW"><strong>Sojourn</strong></p>
<p id="rveKNz">Railgun</p>
<ul>
<li id="MQjuKd">Secondary fire damage scaling reduced from 30-130 damage down to 1-100 damage.</li>
<li id="IvJHGh">Secondary fire projectile no longer requires Overclock to pierce enemy players.</li>
<li id="hyxEIo">Primary fire shots per second increased from 14 to 16.</li>
</ul>
<p id="OA2rK1">Overclock</p>
<ul><li id="cJu1Ay">Energy charge rate increased from 100 to 120 per second.</li></ul>
<p id="2clk2t"><em>Developer Comments: This change is reducing the burst damage potential of the secondary fire Railgun shot to both lessen frustration from playing against that burst damage, and to shift power into her sustained primary fire damage. This should smooth out the feast-or-famine nature of Sojourn consistently hitting the secondary fire shots.</em></p>
<p id="jTlZYW"><strong>Symmetra</strong></p>
<ul><li id="Li3Pci">Base health increased from 100 to 125 (Total health increased from 250 to 275).</li></ul>
<p id="KrPQx0">Photon Projector</p>
<ul><li id="3UQHpH">Primary fire charge rate increased 25%.</li></ul>
<p id="d7hNzQ"><em>Developer Comments: To help solidify Symmetra as a close-range threat, we’re increasing her health to better survive in that range, along with how quickly her primary fire beam damage ramps up.</em></p>
<h4 id="eEaDYb"><strong>Support</strong></h4>
<p id="kdqss0"><strong>Illari</strong></p>
<p id="VFDsRg">Healing Pylon</p>
<ul>
<li id="9aaoZ2">Healing per projectile increased from 30 to 40.</li>
<li id="sGCiC4">Pylon healing is now only half as effective when targeting Illari.</li>
<li id="isicGW">Max health increased from 100 to 125.</li>
</ul>
<p id="QgJySW">Outburst</p>
<ul><li id="Iv0Jpk">Damage increased from 10 to 25.</li></ul>
<p id="1nEHMS"><em>Developer Comments: Illari’s Healing Pylon is intended to be useful for healing her team in relatively safe positions without much focus required, which enables her to either apply pressure with her primary fire or spot heal in bursts from her more limited secondary fire healing beam. To encourage this, it now has improved health and healing output, but is less effective when Illari uses it to heal herself.</em></p>
<p id="8V5eR0"><strong>Kiriko</strong></p>
<p id="qZrvHT">Protection Suzu</p>
<ul><li id="nlK4lY">No longer cleanses hard knockdown stuns.</li></ul>
<p id="cieNGT">Swift Step</p>
<ul><li id="fCdWcV">Cooldown increased from 7 to 8 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="TsNH1X"><em>Developer Comments: “Hard knockdown stuns” refer to most all of the existing knockdowns where the player is stunned and laying on the ground (such as Reinhardt’s Earthshatter), with the exception of Ana’s Sleep Dart effect, which is removed upon taking damage or Protection Suzu’s cleanse.</em></p>
<h3 id="hKTg2i"><strong>Map Updates</strong></h3>
<p id="BtQQcF"><strong>Colosseo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="Sd7HGU">Removed the glass and added stairs at first checkpoint for additional pathing and combat opportunities.</li>
<li id="1Rq0vp">Extended the map with a new lowered section and mega health pack behind the second checkpoint for flank/rotational strategies</li>
<li id="8BRFUa">Added a route through a building that connects spawn/final point to second checkpoint.</li>
<li id="C6z2DG">The initial spawn building has been pulled back to give players more room to smoothly navigate the area out front. There is no added run back time with this change.</li>
<li id="jph9o8">The stairs and cover surrounding the final point have been adjusted to improve the flow of the space and to help teams safely defend the final point.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Aij2Zm"><strong>Push Game Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="qEydHw">Reduced the match time from 10 minutes to 8 minutes in Quick Play.</li>
<li id="ipWozc">Increased push robot speed by 10% when pushing the barricade for both Quick Play and Competitive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6xg75k"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<h4 id="eDMCZz"><strong>Maps</strong></h4>
<p id="yMb4A2"><strong>Numbani</strong></p>
<ul><li id="XfwAPZ">Fixed pieces of the environment that allowed abilities to pass through it.</li></ul>
<p id="Mj7qZa"><strong>New Junk City</strong></p>
<ul><li id="4x4Hn6">Fixed lighting in some areas of the map.</li></ul>
<p id="gB2UWc"><strong>Hollywood</strong></p>
<ul><li id="PIFKvD">Fixed areas of the map that could cause players to become temporarily stuck.</li></ul>
<h4 id="GKq1xv"><strong>Heroes</strong></h4>
<p id="Sxm6qN"><strong>Junker Queen</strong></p>
<ul><li id="yzsAW4">Fixed a bug that caused Junker Queen’s Commanding Shout to play the audio again when using a Teleporter.</li></ul>
<p id="cjFIdO"><strong>Reinhardt</strong></p>
<ul><li id="AB93bB">Charge now correctly damages Ice Wall and Tree of Life.</li></ul>
<p id="pTXE4Y"><strong>Venture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="XFUvN1">Fixed an interaction that allowed Venture to stay burrowed indefinitely.• Fixed the description of Drill Dash to match its functionality.</li>
<li id="PDs82p">Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that could allow it to charge Venture’s Ultimate Meter some situations.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Z7SoYc"><strong>Zarya</strong></p>
<ul><li id="utaVTD">Fixed an interaction where a Particle Shielded Zarya standing on a Teleporter could prevent teammates from using the teleporter.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/green-hell-6-million-sales/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Green Hell was first released back in 2019, joining an ever-growing line-up of open-world survival titles that pitted players against the elements. Green Hell’s draw was that it was more realistic than its competitors, boasting unique elements that required players to manage both their mental and physical health while they navigated a massive jungle and fought to survive. </p>



<p>It was just revealed by the game’s developer, Creepy Jar, that the title has surpassed six million sales since being released in 2018, averaging a cool 1.2 million sales per year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-learn-to-survive">Learn to Survive</h2>



<p>Green Hell was well-reviewed when it dropped in 2019, and since then, it landed on a few more platforms, coming to Nintendo Switch in 2020 and then winding up on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2021. The staggered release pattern served the game well, with the player count remaining relatively consistent as free updates were deployed by Creepy Jar.</p>



<p>In April, the team pushed out the twentieth free update for the game, introducing new animals, survival mechanics, and construction blueprints. In the years that have followed since the game’s launch, the developers have introduced controller support, a cooperative story mode, an achievements system, farming, countless building features, and new enemies. That’s not bad considering the game always seems to be on sale somewhere for just a few dollars.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Survival games like Green Hell have blown up in recent years. Titles like Sons of the Forest, Valheim, ARK, Subnautica, Raft, SCUM, and V Rising all found popularity in the market for their intense levels of freedom, base-building mechanics, and at times challenging combat sequences.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ELDEN RING: Shadow of the Erdtree Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">What wasn't previously detailed was the ability for players to now ride their spectral steed during the game's final boss battle, or the myriad of weapon and skill balance changes listed in the full patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of changes can be read below, but there are a few specific changes worth noting. In PvP, a number of powerful skills, like Ancient Lightning Spear, Flaming Strike, Cursed-Blood Slash, and Transient Moonlight, now deal less damage. Also on the PvP front, a number of weapon types have had their poise damage increased or decreased depending on what the opponent is using, and the poise damage of various dual-wielded weapons has also been decreased.</p><p dir="ltr">On PvE and PvP side of the equation, a number of weapons, like the Troll Knight's Sword, Zamor Curved Sword, and Forked Hatchet, now deal more damage. A number of staves and Seals have had their attribute scaling increased as well. Weapon types like axes, greataxes, hammers, flails, and reapers have had their attack speed increased, while axes, greataxes, and some colossal weapons now deal more damage with their charged attacks. Whips (the Ulmi whip being an exception) have also seen a damage increase. Consecutive attacks made with light bows and longbows are faster, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The update enables support for Shadow of the Erdtree, but the DLC itself is not required to receive the free Elden Ring update. For those wondering precisely when the DLC becomes available in each region, publisher Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-launch-times-revealed/1100-6524289/" data-ref-id="1100-6524289">revealed Shadow of the Erdtree's specific launch times</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>, we called From Software's ambitious expansion a "victory lap" for the developer, and "an unmissable tour de force that is every bit as brilliant as the original game."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Elden Ring Patch 1.12 Notes</h2><h2>New feature</h2><ul><li>Added support for the SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE DLC.</li><li>Five new hairstyles have been added to the game.

            <p>
After a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-news-teased-for-showcase-tomorrow">teasing</a> and some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">original edition delisting</a>, Ubisoft has - slightly prematurely, it would seem - announced a release date for its Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition remaster. According to a now-deleted social media post, it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Switch next Tuesday, 25th June - with new in-game content and more.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">confirmed</a> it was working on a remaster of its much-loved 2003 action-adventure Beyond Good and Evil last November, after a "technical error" inadvertently granted some Ubisoft+ subscribers access to an early development build. And now, somewhat sooner than expected (Ubisoft had originally told fans to keep an eye out for news during tonight's Limited Run Games showcase), fresh details have emerged.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a 25th June release date on PC and consoles, Ubisoft's social media post confirmed its new Beyond Good and Evil remaster will feature (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-launches-june-25-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc?s=31">Gematsu</a>) a bunch of presentational upgrades and some new in-game content too. For starters, there's 4K support at 60fps - as well as the more nebulous promise of "improved graphics, controls, and audio" - and the game is getting autosave and cross-save features too.

<p>
Additionally, Beyond Good and Evil's original adventure - which follows reporter Jade as she investigates a terrible government conspiracy with some help from her pig pal Pey'j - now features new treasure hunts revealing more about Jade's past, plus "new rewards" to find while exploring. There's also a new speedrun mode, updated achievements, and a gallery featuring behind-the-scenes details.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft also briefly shared a trailer showcasing Beyond Good and Evil's remaster, but that's now been pulled too. Expect it to resurface during tonight's Limited Run Games showcase - airing at 7pm BST/11am PT/2pm ET - which will hopefully include pricing details too. The price point should be particularly interesting given Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-and-evil-delisting-prompts-speculation-of-imminent-remaster-release">delist the relatively inexpensive earlier version</a> from Steam and the Xbox Store this week - although PC players can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/beyond_good_and_evil">currently pick it up via GOG for £1.29</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition will be available for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC when it launches next Tuesday, 25th June. Now we just need some news about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">ludicrously long-in-the-works</a> Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> finally goes live, Bandai Namco has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178537/great-haircut-tarnished">implemented a patch</a> that adds a couple of small features and updates just in time for the DLC’s launch in a few short hours. FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><div><figcaption><em>Hooray! New hair options!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: FromSoftware</cite></p></div><p>To change your appearance, all you have to do is visit <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fia">Fia, Deathbed Companion</a>’s room at the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold">Roundtable Hold</a>. She should have a mirror you can interact with that will let you change your appearance. However! If you’re like me and have completed Fia’s questline, neither she nor her mirror will be present at the Roundtable Hold. Instead, travel to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library site of grace and talk to Rennala. You’ll be able to change your appearance through her.</p><p>Secondly — and this is arguably the best little housekeeping update the game has had — the new patch lets you see all your recently acquired items. From now on, new items you pick up either in the Lands Between or the DLC’s Shadow Lands will be marked with a little exclamation point. The game will even collect those new items under their own tab, though that “new items” tab isn’t enabled by default. You have to go into the game’s settings and select the “Show recent items tab” option.</p><div><p><strong>Tarnished note:</strong> remember, you cannot apply weapon greases to enchanted weapons like the Moonveil Katana. Carry around a high-powered but basic weapon to use them.</p></div><p>It was extremely helpful in my journey to see the new items and equipment I picked up so I could compare them to the stuff I’d been carrying around for the last 100 hours. Without it, I would have missed the new “Festive Grease” item that increases the number of runes you earn every time you land an attack and the little notes I picked in my travels that hint at where to go next. The “new items” feature makes choosing the right gear and weapons to tackle all the new threats in <em>Shadows of the Erdtree</em> so much easier. Enable it right away.</p><p>Beyond that, the patch adds a bunch of weapon balance changes and helpfully tweaks the summoning pool feature for folks who need help taking down Mohg, Lord of Blood, in order to access the DLC. The new patch will also let you summon your faithful horse-goat Torrent during the Elden Beast fight, which will undoubtedly make that final encounter loads easier. You can read the patch notes in detail <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

FromSoftware also shared a new launch trailer to herald the DLC’s arrival, but it’s chockful of spoilers, so beware. The update isn’t particularly earth-shattering, but it does include some things worth keeping in mind before all you Tarnished <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">get your head beat in by the vicious monsters patrolling the Shadow Lands</a>.</p><p>Firstly, we get new hair options! I was pretty down on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">for its lack of Black hairstyles</a>. It just didn’t make sense that the character creator was so robust and detailed but lacked hairstyles that represent a good chunk of the human population. There are five new styles to choose from, with two of them being dreadlocks. I chose the loose loc option so my Tarnished can finally get rid of her abhorrent pigtails. I’m not sure if the “white hairs” option was present in the base game or a new addition with this patch, but I really like how it adds gray to my locs, reminding me of when I started picking out errant gray hairs when I had locs.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24182462/tips-for-starting-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-43eaf862-9491-4d14-beb5-bbaf20f6ebf9"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-6ab76529-be7d-43f0-88dd-1d72f7563cee"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-520331fc-ff9b-4045-af71-3a1f96f7e374"><div><p>And most of ‘em still haven’t beaten Mohg.</p><p>To prepare us for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> FromSoftware has released a “The Journey So Far” video.

In a part of <a href="https://youtu.be/qLZenOn7WUo?si=h_dnwWb_p-lV5JBa">the new trailer</a>, it looks like a monster (or a Tarnished, can’t tell) is doing some flippy-dippy martial arts nonsense. Turns out it’s a move taken from one of the mini-bosses in <em>Sekiro</em>. Every FromSoftware game incorporates elements from its siblings and it’s neat to see those influences proliferate throughout. </p><p>I can’t wait for this DLC to ruin me.</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-1904a03f-1b24-4bc0-88f0-f8d4b1794fa5"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-988deac6-0115-41c2-8892-101f9872a07d"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-6c8321cd-23af-4dcf-a691-09332c60356c"><div><p>Get your first look at Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion on Wednesday morning.</p><p>It’s been almost a year since FromSoftware <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618215/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-dlc-announced-details">announced it was working on DLC</a> for the 2022 hit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and now we have a date and time for the first Shadow of the Erdtree gameplay reveal trailer: February 21st, 10 AM ET / 7AM PT / 4PM CET.</p><p>The 3-minute presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLZenOn7WUo">will be available on YouTube</a> with subtitles in your preferred language.</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-cd8dc86b-cf55-457c-b12b-a40138545754"><div><p>Tarnished on Tour.</p><p>Bandai Namco has announced that it’s launching an <em>Elden Ring</em> concert tour.

According to Bandai Namco <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-107">on the game’s website</a>, the patch intends to “encourage more versatility in terms of gameplay” — if “encourage” also means “make you a nigh unkillable god in single player.” A lot of weapons and spells were buffed, very few things were nerfed, and it seems like it’s going to get a lot harder to kill your friends in PVP. The patch notes are indeed massive, but I’ve picked out a few highlights.</p><p><strong>Glintstone Pebble / Shard Spiral: </strong>increased attack power </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402616/elden-ring-dlc-patch-notes-update">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-25f0b8ed-7cd2-4ce1-a29e-5c990e2b8e10"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map</a></h2><p>One of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> most polarizing features is its willingness to withhold information. While it’s less arcane than earlier FromSoftware titles like <em>Dark Souls</em>, the game constantly hands you items, quests, and mechanics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">with very little explanation</a>. But after 130 hours and counting in the Lands Between, I’m in love with how well it sometimes deploys that obscurity. And there’s no better example than <em>Elden Ring’s</em> map, which has transcended a simple open-world convention to become one of my very favorite pieces of the game.</p><p>If you’re still in the early areas of <em>Elden Ring</em>, you might want to skip this post because I’m going to talk about a mechanic that relies on mystery. But if you’ve played a bit of the game, you might know what I’m talking about. <em>Elden Ring’s </em>map offers a constant give-and-take of showing players new spaces to explore, then pulling back a curtain to more places that they didn’t even realize could <em>exist. </em>It withholds information only to reveal it in a way that’s delightful, satisfying, and entirely in keeping with the world’s vast scope. It’s not just an interface element — it’s a meta-game in its own right.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-1f35292d-22d9-439f-860e-b2081da09671"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Elden Ring speedrunners race to the bottom</a></h2><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is just so massive and its bosses are so tough that the average player will probably take over 60 hours to beat it. But speedrunners, assisted by some traditional speedrunning tricks and the game’s own open design, have somehow managed to beat the sprawling game in under 30 minutes.</p><p>For a speedrunning enthusiast, the first days of a game’s release are extremely exciting. New techniques and optimizations are constantly being discovered, as boss behaviors and the runner’s own luck work with or against them, making almost every run a possible world record. While every runner is ostensibly competing against the clock, two runners have emerged in the <em>Elden Ring</em> speed community, each racing to post lower and lower times.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979436/elden-ring-speedrunners-world-record-race-30-minutes">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-09122418-f13d-437e-b87d-28b971708154"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973032/elden-ring-easy-rune-farm-dragon-caelid">I’ve made a huge mistake in Elden Ring</a></h2><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, it’s killed or be killed — brutally. The game is designed to put you ever on the defensive, ready to lash out before you yourself can be lashed. But that shoot first, ask questions later mindset led to an event I truly and deeply regret. I killed a dragon, and I feel really awful about it.</p><p>In <em>Elden Ring</em>, even the damn flowers are dangerous, but contrary to the game’s reputation, not everything in the Lands Between wants to kill you. There are those cute rodents that scurry about and delightful little donut-rolling sheep that exist only to bleat at you as you zip by them on Torrent. I’ve had so many peaceful moments sitting on the edge of a cliff, gazing in wondrous awe at the golden Erdtree with a convocation of eagles for company. I’d never think to kill any of these creatures because, for one, they’re worth a pitiful amount of runes, and secondly, they’re harmless.&nbsp;(Editor’s note: <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Webster/status/1500278513567469568">killing the calm, wise old tortoises</a> should be punished by a full game restart, even if it’s an accident.)</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973032/elden-ring-easy-rune-farm-dragon-caelid">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-fbb524f6-1d69-4ae1-b31e-14edb14ee6c0"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">Elden Ring’s world is full of mystery, but I’d rather wait for a guide</a></h2><p>It seems like everyone, even people who don’t usually partake in FromSoftware games, is playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. It’s currently the seventh most played game on Steam based on <a href="https://steamdb.info/graph/?sort=peak">number of concurrent players</a> and has a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/year/all/filtered">97 on Metacritic</a>, putting it on track to be this year’s highest rated game. </p><p>And while I have enjoyed the bits of <em>Elden Ring</em> I’ve played, I’m not too keen on joining the rest of my Tarnished colleagues in the Lands Between just yet. I’m gonna wait for the guide writers, speedrunners, and wiki editors to catch up, because from my dabblings in FromSoftware games, I know that in order to truly enjoy <em>Elden Ring,</em> I’m gonna need a lot of help that just doesn’t exist yet.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954823/elden-ring-open-world-guide">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-c5a1f4fc-652b-4d28-9e01-d74faa25b59f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">Elden Ring’s character creator fails Black players</a></h2><p>Most of you playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> are probably knee-deep in the Lands Between, getting your shit rocked by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-beat-elden-ring-tree-sentinel-parry/">that asshole on the horse</a>, but my mind hasn’t left the game’s first menus. Though the many classes present a paralyzing wealth of options, it’s not the question of what class to play that has me stuck. It’s the character creator. I’m stymied by the bizarrely incongruous system that allows for an unprecedented level of control of every minute detail of facial feature but only has one kinky hair option.</p><p>I didn’t expect much from <em>Elden Ring</em>’s character creator. FromSoftware games have a bit of a reputation for being kinda bad at character creation, especially regarding skin. In <em>Bloodborne</em>, skin colors and textures were distinctly unnatural-looking. My character was this orangey-looking mess of a human, and there were precisely zero kinky hair options.&nbsp;</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22951205/elden-rings-character-creator-black-hairstyles">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-573eba81-c900-4d4e-b4bc-db950e360b19"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950591/elden-ring-ps5-rest-mode-save-bug">Elden Ring PSA: Bandai Namco warns of PS5 save bug</a></h2><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a><em> </em>rockets up the charts, amassing some of the most glowing reviews this side of <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, Bandai Namco <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/message-about-some-performance-issues-elden-ring">has issued a PSA</a> letting players know it’s working on ironing out some of the day-one kinks.</p><p>In the PSA, Bandai Namco said it’s working on correcting some issues related to mouse over-sensitivity, PC anti-cheat bugs, and frame rate / game performance issues that, somewhat annoyingly, cause the game to stutter at random moments. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/25/22950591/elden-ring-ps5-rest-mode-save-bug">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-407381c8-98ae-4ddb-839e-78d0b5460aab"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Elden Ring is a sprawling fantasy epic so good I don’t want it to end</a></h2><p>When I was a kid, I would look at paperback fantasy novels and dream. I was too young to read these tales of sex and violence, but those hand-painted covers, full of dragons and swords and ancient ruins, held a promise of adventure that captivated me. It’s a feeling I continued to chase when I went on my own fantasy quests in games dating back to the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em>.

It’s an ambitious premise, but it’s also one <em>Elden Ring</em> more than lives up to. It has everything you’d expect from the developer — deep and challenging combat, complex systems, lore that’s equal parts beautiful and sad — and fuses it with an absolutely gigantic world that you can explore however you like.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I played a bit of Building Relationships at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-announced-and-featured-at-day-of-the-devs-2024-in-one-place">Day Of The Devs</a> booth at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest</a> last week. That particular booth is a smear of half-memories, because the organisers asked us to play five games inside an hour, and this being Day Of The Devs, it was a regular cornucopia of concepts, styles and subject matters. I went from playing While Waiting, a game about occupying your mind while you’re waiting, to After Love EP, a game about death, grief and rock music, to UFO50, which is 50 games that together form a mosaic of meta-gaming mystery. Also Phoenix Springs, a dystopian adventure notable for a clipped English voiceover so dispassionate I stepped away feeling dehydrated. Write-ups for those to follow once I've worked out where one game ended and the next began.</p>
<p>Building Relationships stands out the most in hindsight because it felt the most at ease in its own skin and also, because it's not every day you get to chat up a small apartment building. (I personally wouldn't date an apartment building because all the ones I've lived in had mold, but this one had a certain forlorn charisma, reminiscent of that friend who's too busy pairing off everybody else to find love himself.) It's a pocket open worlder with boisterous katamari physics in which you bounce about fluttering your curtains at bungalows and completing very simple quests, such as fishing (in this case, for cars). It is a game wholly invested in the act of enjoying a pun, which is surely the definition of a promising first date. It has pleasantly daft writing, blossoming biomes that remind me of Proteus a bit, and some amusing camera angle choices during conversation.</p>
<p>Building Relationships is the debut Steam release of Tanat Boozayaangool, who is also the creator of <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/to-remember-a-massacre">sinister trivia games</a> and <a href="https://tanatb.itch.io/in-bed-cant-sleep">visual novels about not being able to sleep</a>. Here is a little excerpt from <a href="https://tanatb.carrd.co/">the developer’s web page</a>: "There's a joy in absurdity, suspending all levels of disbelief and immersing yourself in the wildest world. And there you'll find the most human story, anchoring the most ridiculous narrative."</p>

			<p>Today, publisher Focus Home Interactive and developer Saber Interactive released a 6-minute gameplay overview of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. Creative Director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained:</p>
<p><em>The game's campaign mode allows you to experience this epic story either solo or with up to three players in co-op. The story of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 begins centuries after the events of the first game. Captain Dimitrian Titus is a genetically enhanced supersoldier and a hero of the Ultramarines. Titus has returned to the Ultramarines, where is demoted to Lieutenant and forced to prove his loyalty to the Imperium in the heat of battle. On a distant world, he must face one of humanity's most fearsome adversaries - the Tyranids. As you take control of Titus and his battle-brothers, you will be thrown into the thick of a war of galactic proportions. Thanks to our unique Swarm engine, allowing to render hundreds of real enemies on screen at the same time. You'll face seemingly endless waves of enemies, crawling and swarming as far as the eye can see. You must repel the Tyranid invasion and rid the system of the Xenos threat, battling in claustrophobic jungles, majestic planet-spanning metropolises, and other epic locations. After each successful mission, you'll return to the Battle Barge, a space fortress serving as the Ultramarines' orbital HQ. Here, you can gain crucial intel by interacting with onboard personnel. Review your next targets and tailor your loadout to the upcoming mission. Whether you prefer close combat or ranged warfare, the Ultramarines' wide range of equipment offers an array of devastating weapons and unique special abilities. A balanced approach is certainly wise since performing the brutal melee finisher replenishes your armor and keeps you in the fight for longer. </em></p>
<p><em>Beyond the story campaign of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, you'll find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-maine-2-co-op-operations-mode-6v6-pvp-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operations mode</a>. Here, the focus is on cooperation and replayability. Play as one of six classes with unique skills and abilities. Then, develop and customize them to make them your own. Whether you prefer the Sniper, the Vanguard, or the Bulwark, your Space Marine specialty, along those of your squadmates, will be decisive on the battlefield. The more missions you play, the more you'll unlock cosmetics for your Space Marine. Also, XP and Armory Data can be spent on the Battle Barge's armory to unlock new class perks and improve your armament's performance. </em></p>
<p><em>If you're into more competitive challenges, enter the fray in the Eternal War mode, where you'll be able to pit yourself against other players. Six Space Marines clash against six of their sworn Chaos adversaries. Choose your preferred ruleset and engage in adrenaline-pumping matches that will test your skills against players from across the world. Each Skirmish offers you the chance to earn more XP and add more weapons to your arsenal as you prove your valor on the battlefield.</em></p>
