                <p>Everyone knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a> was going to be the hottest game console of 2025, but someone has provided an entirely different kind of heat. Earlier this month, thieves stole nearly 3,000 Nintendo Switch 2 consoles out of a truck without being detected until it was too late.</p><p>A semi-truck driver reported the theft on June 8 at a truck stop in Bennett, Colorado. The driver told police that he discovered the missing Switch 2 boxes while performing a pre-trip inspection. Police determined that 2,810 Switch 2 consoles were taken.</p><p>"They retail at $499. The cost to Nintendo is just over $410," said Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office public information officer Anders Nelson. "So either way you look at it, it's well over $1 million worth of merchandise stolen."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fp0MGCgz2Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-fp0MGCgz2Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/nintendo-switch-theft-truck-colorado/73-27ca5808-6901-4229-b1b4-4862c73b300b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">9NBC</a>'s report, MSU Denver computer science professor Steve Beaty noted that the thieves may use the Dark Web to sell the stolen consoles, but that doesn't mean the trail has gone entirely cold for Nintendo or the police. They can potentially identify the stolen consoles by their serial numbers when they go online.</p><p>"Nintendo does have the capability of what we call bricking the device and that is to make it nonfunctional," added Beaty.</p><p>In the past, Nintendo has gone to great lengths to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">track down and identify Switch 1 pirates</a>, so it's entirely plausible that the company will flag any stolen Switch 2 consoles that show up on its radar. But for now, the thieves behind this truck stop heist have yet to be caught.</p><p>Players in Japan have had such difficulty getting Switch 2 consoles because of resellers jacking up the price that they've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/japan-is-getting-goofy-with-switch-2-marketplace-listings/1100-6532415/" data-ref-id="1100-6532415">posting parody listings for it on third-party marketplaces</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has received a fresh update for those playing in early access, as the studio finally approaches the final phase of development ahead of a full release.</p>
<p>Supergiant's sequel has been in early access for over a year, with its full release highly anticipated after both the success of the original game and positive praise for Hades 2. While many had expected an announcement as part of Summer Game Fest season (or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s release), alas that time has come to pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for the full release, but at least Hades 2 is approaching its final form. "We're heading into the final phase of Hades 2 development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post from the developer</a>. "Please note we do not yet have a v1.0 launch date, though we'll share more as soon as we can."</p>

<p>It continues: "As we wind down our Early Access phase, our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet, and - most importantly - a worthy successor to the original Hades.</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up! While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades 2 is still to come, so may moonlight guide us! And to all our Early Access players, thank you for being here, and sharing your impressions of The Unseen Update with us."</p>
<p>As for The Unseen Update, it adds Hidden Aspects to the Nocturnal Arms, giving each weapon an all-new fighting style to unlock; new "stronger-than-ever" Guardians to beat; expanded magicks with Godsent Hexes; fresh optional story events to strengthen bonds with characters; and revamped Umbral Flames for a "snappier fighting style".</p>
<p>The update is available for free for those who have purchased the game in early access.</p>
<p>To finish Hades 2's development, Supergiant is adding: a true ending to conclude Melinoë's story, Achievements, and final touches of polish. Hopefully that means a launch date won't be too far off.</p>
<p>At the moment the game is only available in early access on Steam, but its full launch will include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">release on Switch and Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive</a>, as confirmed by Supergiant in April.</p>
<p>The original Hades was first released on PC and Switch in full, before arriving on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and later iOS (via Netflix).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-says-grounded-2-wont-have-lan-multiplayer-either-and-its-a-huge-shame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Grounded 2 won't have local multiplayer support, just as there wasn't - and still isn't - LAN support in the current Grounded game. "We can confirm that Grounded 2 will be consistent with the prior game and does not support LAN multiplayer," a spokesperson from Obsidian told Eurogamer. I asked for an explanation why but was told Obsidian had nothing further to share.</p>
<p>It's a shame. The sequel presents Obsidian with an opportunity to revisit areas of the teens-shrunk-in-a-backyard co-op game that could use revision, and LAN multiplayer is one of these, trivial though it might seem.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to play Grounded with someone in the same room or house as you - and it sounds like this will be the case for the sequel - you need to connect via the internet first. In other words, you need to send a signal out of your house so it can be sent back to your house to connect to the other person's machine. The result? Latency, or lag as it's more commonly called, which causes a delayed response in the game and rubber-banding - a term used to describe characters or creatures which fast-forward suddenly to different places in the game.</p>

<p>Lag is not only annoying to play with but in Grounded's case, deadly. Back at launch, in 2020, I spent a couple of days writing guides about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-spiders-wolf-spiders-orb-weavers-7041">how to kill the spiders in Grounded</a>, because they're a menace, patrolling large areas of the back garden and attacking with speed and aggression if they catch you with eyesight of them. The wolf spiders in particular were ferocious. It was possible to defeat them if you learnt their attack patterns and had precise parry timing, but it was still hard to do.</p>
<p>However, confident I could deal with the spiders, I encouraged my partner to play the game with me, both of us playing on different machines in the same room. But I couldn't beat the spiders; the lag introduced by connecting via the internet meant I couldn't reliably perform the parry timings I'd learned. If I hosted the game, that changed, but one of us always suffered high latency as a result.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand why there was no LAN support in the game, given gaming's long history with LAN multiplayer: local networks were the preferred way to play together before broadband and stable internet connections came in. Plenty of other games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for example - offer LAN multiplayer as standard. So I went online to see if I was the only person having the problem. I was not.</p>

<p>"How difficult would it REALLY be for the devs to enable LAN support on multiplayer?" one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedGame/comments/yz3osb/how_difficult_would_it_really_be_for_the_devs_to/">on Reddit asked in 2022</a>, two years after the game's release. "The rubber banding is so bad it makes me not want to play on very decent internet connections..."</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/128939-multiplayer-lan-latency-problem/">on the Obsidian forum</a>, again in 2022, a reply to a similar thread read: "This has been an issue from day one. I have posted about it here and on other forums. I have not ever seen the developers mention anything about fixes or work arounds for players attempting to plan LAN or from the same internet connection. It's pretty sad really. In my household we have 5 copies of this game, and we are unable to play it together because of the lag and terrible performance when trying to do so, from the same internet connection."</p>
<p>A lack of LAN support in Grounded is a prevalent enough problem for me and others that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/groundeds-inch-high-garden-survival-is-getting-a-sequel-and-its-out-very-soon">when Grounded 2 was announced a couple of weeks ago</a>, the main thing I was looking for was confirmation of LAN multiplayer support. But of course it never came, despite, again, Obsidian and Xbox underlining the game's focus on co-operative multiplayer.</p>
<p>My worry reading Obsidian's response to Eurogamer, about there being no LAN support in Grounded 2, is this has become the company's stance on the matter - that Grounded 1 and 2 will simply never have LAN support. But why? Is there a fundamental issue with the game's code that prevents LAN play, or is it something to do with Microsoft requiring an Xbox Live sign-in for security and validation reasons? Perhaps it's just a way to push Xbox Live. Even if it's all of those things, I still can't see why LAN support should be an impossibility. It would help if Obisidian would explain.</p>
<p>As it stands, this is disappointing and a missed opportunity. I enjoyed Grounded and I'm excited by the sequel, but I'm put off at the prospect of high latency ruining my co-operative experience again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases 29th July on Steam Early Access and the Xbox Game Preview program.</p>

<p>Oh, boy... Look, we know folks are eager to get their hands on the Switch 2, but this ain't it.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YulZM-vmg7Q">9News</a>, over 2,800 Switch 2 consoles have been stolen from a semi-truck while it was en route to a GameStop in Texas.

<p>It's not, however, currently known exactly when or where the heist actually took place.</p>
<p>The total value of the consoles has been estimated at $1.4 million. Investigations are naturally still ongoing at the time of writing, so we'll just have to keep an eye on this one and see how things shake out.</p>

            <p>The best thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so many games. The most terrifying thing about Steam's Next Fests nowadays is that there are so damn many games. It's no surprise then, that according to calculations by developer Chris Hanney and the GameDiscoverCo newsletter, the latest summer Next Fest continued a trend of substantial year-on-year demo number growth.</p>
<p>Hanney, a dev on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-pirate-trainer">Space Pirate Trainer</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shredders">Shredders</a> among others, has had a go at pulling the numbers on the numbers of demos uploaded to Steam during each next fest running back to 2019's Game Awards-adjacent first edition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hanney.bsky.social/post/3lrrxxznsis2m">Hanney's findings</a>, that December 2019 Steam Game Festival saw just 44 demos go live, whereas the latest June 2025 Next Fest included 1994 of them, all vying for your eyeballs, keyboards, mice, and firstborn children. On the other hand, GameDiscoverCo's <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-june-2025s-steam-next-fest">latest newsletter</a> cites the latter number as being in the region of 2,600 demos. As GameDiscover's Simon Carless points out: "It’s difficult to get an exact demo count, because lots of games drop out late or don’t submit valid demos and have to be culled."</p>
<p>Hanney's graph cites the numbers as being pretty stable between 160-ish on the low end to 300 demos on the higher end per fest throughout most of 2020 to 2022, with some fluctuation up and down. Then, things hit June 2023, which had 344 demos, and haven't stopped increasing since then. The biggest jump it cites is from 1079 demos in 2024's October Next Fest to 1710 in this February's edition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GameDiscoverCo's data has October 2024's Next Fest at an even higher number of demos than June '25, putting it at 3,008. The thing both sources have in common is pointing to a general year-on-year increase in demo numbers from June 2023 to this month, aligning with the idea that Next Fests are generally getting more crowded as time goes on.</p>
<p>So, what kind of boost did the top performers get out of this latest Next Fest, with all of that competition? Well, taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> out of the equation as GameDiscoverCo cites it as a bit of an outlier since it fully launched during this June's Next Fest, two games are cited as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFAPcHkdkjZppOxWHlU6sq3qNqWBe3ExLXrDNyzEVpU/edit?gid=479676648#gid=479676648">having gained over 100,000 wishlists</a>. ARPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vindictus-defying-fate">Vindictus: Defying Fate</a> was the best non-SB performer, adding 151,605 wishlists to push its pre-fest total of 592,569 up to 744,174. Meanwhile, third place Dispatch gained 110,239 to go from 434,671 to 544,910.</p>
<p>Most of the top titles saw their wishlists multiply by similar factor in proportion to their pre-fest total. The biggest growers, and the exceptions to that trend, were the likes of Mr. Billion: Idle Rich Tycoon - which went from 864 pre-fest wishlists to 22,788, multiplying its wishlist total by 26 in the process. Topping that growth was bullet hell roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terratech">TerraTech</a> Legion, which the data cites as having grown from one solitary wishlist to 20,715, multiplying its total by, er, 20,715.</p>
<p>I looked at the <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-announcements-of">publication's data</a> on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T__AlDt9BDFsKutObeaijwp7oI9Z4Def8sGNO8GMT_Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0">'Not-E3' showcase season wishlist bumps</a>, and Next Fests are still lagging a bit behind those numbers at this point, though it is worth noting Vindictus: Defying Fate's Next Fest wishlist increase would have put it just inside the top 10 of that ranking of 'Not-E3' games' wishlists in the five days after they made their showcase appearances. Just behind Grounded 2 at 168,409 and ahead of the likes of Nioh 3 and Final Fantasy Tactics, though all of those games' totals were stating from zero.</p>
<p>GameDiscoverCo noted in its <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-games-hit-big-in-steams-feb?open=false#%C2%A7which-games-hit-big-in-the-feb-next-fest">February 2025 Next Fest analysis</a> that comparing that iteration to February 2024's Fest illustrated the top demos benefitting by a tiny bit more, while there was much more interest in the games further down the publication top 100 rankings, with the caveat that the substantial year-on-year growth in the total number of demos in the Next Fest arena is likely making it a lot tougher to get close to the top 100 spots.</p>
<p>This is the point that inspired Hanney's post, with the growth of Next Fests changing what they represent from the perspectives of game makers looking to use them to get eyes on their works. "The best worst part of this is always - every GDC talk [on launching games via Steam and gaining traction] is already out of date by the time it is given," wrote former Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3lrryp4swvc2g">a reply</a> to the post, "You have to be always moving, always trying new things."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That, however, isn’t always possible. Why? The developer of an upcoming Terminator video game has offered an explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, due out this September, is a retro game based on 1991 action masterpiece <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-2-judgment-day">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>. It features iconic characters from the movie, such as John and Sarah Connor, the T-1000 and the T-800. Check out gameplay and comments from the developers at Bitmap Bureau in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Terminator 2D: No Fate <em>does</em> feature the T-1000 and the T-800 characters, it does not feature Arnie’s likeness. Speaking to IGN, publisher Reef Entertainment explained why, and in the process lifted the lid on how licenses like these tend to work for video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reef, with the Terminator 2 license to play with, has the rights to use the characters from the movie such as Sarah and John Connor, and on top of that, it has image rights for certain actors who have provided those rights to Studio Canal, which owns the rights to the first two Terminator films, as part of the agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the rights to use the Terminator itself does not include the rights to use Arnie's likeness. That’s why Terminator 2D: No Fate uses the endoskeleton for character artwork, rather than Arnie’s likeness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/gettyimages-1203004081-1750236768610.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards as Old John Connor. Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as all that, Reef got in touch with Michael Edwards, the actor who played General John Connor in the iconic opening of Terminator 2, to do a likeness deal for the video game. Terminator 2D: No Fate includes gameplay that sees the player control future war John Connor in a fight against the machines, fleshing out that brief opening scene in the movie into an entire section of the video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the movie, you only see Edwards’ John Connor for a few seconds, but those seconds are memorable indeed; his heavily scarred face and steely gaze looking out over the battlefield tell us he’s seen and done all sorts in humanity’s desperate struggle for survival against the machines. So Reef reached out separately to the 80-year-old actor to do a deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It turns out that in 2021, Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in a fan-made Terminator film called <a href="https://youtu.be/tF89pdWxaZw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skynet</a>.)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/screenshot-2025-06-18-095636-1750237011381.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in 2021 fan film Skynet. Image credit: Blinky Productions Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short: there’s a difference between signing the Terminator 2 license and having the agreement to use the characters, compared to the actor’s likeness, which is separate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t to say it is impossible to get Arnie’s likeness for use in video games. After all, Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm has managed it multiple times, most recently for Mortal Kombat 1’s DLC character Conan the Barbarian. Before that, NetherRealm managed to get Arnie for the Terminator T-800 DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11. But there’s a gulf between the scope of a game like Terminator 2D: No Fate and the Warner Bros.-backed Mortal Kombat series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that while NetherRealm’s Arnie likeness is in, a soundalike voice actor (Chris Cox) was used for his lines. It doesn’t look like the 77-year-old Schwarzenegger is in the business of doing video game voice work.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Reed Entertainment’s comment to IGN on how all this works in full:</p><blockquote>Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game it’s just a T800. We didn't have his license, unfortunately. But for the rest, you have to ask each actor individually to use his portrait.</blockquote><blockquote>What we have is the right to use the characters. So like Sarah, John, T1000, T800, and then certain actors will also provide image rights to Studio Canal, which is included in the agreement. For example; Linda Hamilton is Sarah Connor, which is why you can see Linda at the beginning of the trailer. Whereas our right to use the Terminator itself, it doesn't include Arnold. When you see the character artwork for that, you'll see it's like the Terminator itself rather than Arnold. It's basically the endoskeleton that we have the right to use.</blockquote><blockquote>Michael Edwards played the future war version of John in the opening of T2. You see him, he lowers his binoculars, he's looking over the battlefield. Someone like that, we reached out separately to him to include his likeness. There's a definite difference between signing the T2 license and having the agreement to use the characters compared to the actor's likeness, which is separate.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence.1221573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the early sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (the new gaming hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 3.5 million units in the first four days and is said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> twice as fast as the original Switch), gaming market analysis firm DFC Intelligence has slightly bumped its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original forecast for 2025</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now the key driver of industry growth for 2025. DFC has increased its forecast for Switch 2 unit sales from 15 million to 16 million. If manufacturing could meet demand, the Switch 2 could sell as many as 20 million units, but DFC considers this unlikely as Nintendo is expected to take a conservative approach to inventory.</em></p>
<p><em>Reflecting its historically conservative approach to new product forecasting, Nintendo is estimating sales of 15 million Switch 2 units through the end of its fiscal year in March 2026. When the original Switch launched in March 2017, Nintendo initially projected 10 million units for the fiscal year but ultimately sold 15 million units in that period. Based on that track record, the fact that Nintendo is forecasting a 15 million unit number gives us confidence that they will be able to ramp up supply and navigate tariff challenges.</em></p>
<p>The long-term forecast hasn't changed. DFC Intelligence still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecasts</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell as many as a hundred million units by the end of 2029, which would make it by far the leader in the console market for this generation. They also still believe Nintendo is trying to become more of a primary partner for third-party publishers, in contrast to its previous positioning as a separate player from Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-14-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to the overall industry, both the Nintendo Switch 2 and GTA VI from next year should help set new hardware and software sales records between 2026 and 2029, as seen in the chart above.</p>

            <p>The developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> have just released a patch in response to player complaints about the game's PvP zones. Folks were annoyed because they kept getting crushed to death by other players piloting an ornithopter (Dune's big flying bug vehicle). It was irksome because it's difficult to damage said vehicle or fight back in any meaningful way. The devs solution is pretty straightforward: "Players no longer receive damage when hit by vehicles". The same patch also addresses respawn times in PvP areas.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When it comes to the crushy ornithopters, the patch may mean we get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/we-have-people-working-on-fixing-the-goomba-stomping-dune-awakenings-pvp-is-getting-dominated-by-packs-of-rabid-ornithopter-pilots-squishing-their-enemies/">fewer moments like this</a>, in which on-foot players are hounded and repeatedly squished by others flying a ship, like some freaky sci-fi version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SutDTIhbQ2g">Steven Speilberg's Duel</a>. Although I am certain some people will still find some creative ways to grief others using the bulky ships. As for the respawning, that was a whole other issue.</p>
<p>"Respawn timeout in PvP zones was adjusted," say <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546738448831086611">the patch notes</a>. "The first respawn will take 70 seconds, [the] second and following respawns will take 115 seconds."</p>
<p>This is a big increase from the previous respawn timers, which irritated players for being too short and allowing defeated opponents to come back and harrass you before you can even enjoy the spoils of your victory. One player complained a respawn was never longer than 12 seconds. "Even when you win a long winded battle the losing team will just re-spawn instantly in the local area," said the player in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lafve6/comment/mxmoaxp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">miffed Reddit post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/funcom-says-its-working-on-a-bunch-of-changes-for-dune-awakening-pvp-after-player-calls-out-the-survival-mmos-biggest-issue/">PC Gamer</a>.

<p>This was especially taxing when fighting a group larger than your own, said the player, since a big enough clan can always have enough fighters on the field. </p>
<p>"[Even] when you pick off members they are back in the fray before you can blink, which just feels bad... As it currently stands, even if you have the better team and beat the odds the larger group will always win as they can just keep chucking bodies at it till the other team gives up or their gear breaks." </p>
<p>As it happened, a developer from Funcom saw this post and responded to it. "We are working on a bunch of changes/fixes to these things," said the dev at the time. "Please bear with us."</p>
<p>And now they've tweaked it. Will 70 seconds be enough? I don't know, I'm probably not the person to ask. I tend to avoid PvP zones - the feel of the game's combat just doesn't click for me, and I don't fancy losing gear when it's a bit of grind to get that gear. An extraction shootist I am not. But I did like the world and many other survival game elements, as I said in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>. </p>
<p>There were some other minor fixes in the patch, including fixes for crashy moments and one frightening issue that would "cause the player to lose Solaris deposited in the bank". Your economic security is assured. Except you may still lose all your pocket money if swallowed by Shai-Hulud, of course.</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Sunshine" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f804adf8a94a5/super-mario-sunshine.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> is often regarded as a bit of an oddball entry in Nintendo's flagship platforming series. It has its fair share of jank, sure, but it's also considered to be a cult classic with fans thanks to its unique gameplay mechanics and memorable setting.</p>
<p>If you happened to be clued in to the game's initial release back in 2002, then you might recall the time when Nintendo pulled off one of the most ridiculous marketing stunts we've ever seen, and it involves pasta – <em>lots</em> of pasta.</p>
<p>Y'see, Nintendo served up a total of 3,265 pounds of so-called 'Pasta a la Mario' at San Francisco's Little Italy, effectively breaking the Guinness World Record for the largest bowl of pasta.</p>
<p>Attendees who arrived dressed as Mario or Luigi were invited to jump into the bowl of pasta and recover hidden Nintendo-themed prizes, including a rather lucrative trip to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Footage of the event has resurfaced thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jusdberube.bsky.social">Justin D. Berube</a> over on Bluesky, who has had short videos of the stunt saved for decades.</p>


<p>Gross, right? Pretty funny, though.</p>
<p>If you're itching to replay Super Mario Sunshine and happened to miss out on the limited 2020 compilation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch, you'll be pleased to know that the game is scheduled to launch on the GameCube NSO app for the Switch 2 at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 via the Expansion Pack subscription tier, with three games playable at launch. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the game'll feel familiar to anyone who's played a till 'em up like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tcg-card-shop-simulator">TCG Card Shop Simulator</a>. You take cash, give change, scan cards, and occasionally check passes for expiry dates or extremely suspect photographs. Some people enter with bluetooth speakers or whinging babies and you have to tell them to quiet down, and most of them are thankfully pretty cooperative, although I haven't played enough to confirm that baby kicking is 100% not in the game. Actually, hang on a sec.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh, yeah you actually can. Do what you want with this information. Nobody is forcing you to boot the children. Here are some less monstrous features:</p>
<blockquote><p>Embark on a wild ride in TROLEU, a wacky first-person action game where you step into the shoes of a trolleybus conductor. Experience the bizarre yet oddly captivating routine of public transportation, where ensuring passengers' travel validity becomes your top priority. Welcome aboard, where the everyday becomes extraordinary, and getting off at next stop isn't an option since now you're the one in charge!</p></blockquote>
<p>To keep you on your toes, there's both a passenger annoyance meter and your own boss, the ticket inspector, to contend with, who makes sure you haven't been letting on fare dodgers. I am as yet not fully convinced there is more than 15 minutes of fun here but it is a very good 15 minutes. The full game is "coming soon".

			<p>Bravely Default was a game that revelled in genre tropes. The result of Square Enix doing what it does best, this 2012 turn-based RPG for 3DS was the kind of thing you’d expect if you grew up on a diet of early Final Fantasy. Such is the overlap that I had to go and look up whether this was ever planned as a Final Fantasy title — it turns out it was, as a sequel to DS game The Four Warriors of Light.</p>
<p>The game was met with mostly positive reviews at the time, with the odd complaint about pacing and tropes mostly being drowned out by praise for the second half of the game. As huge JPRG fans here at TSA, that made us cautiously optimistic about Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster, with all the new and modern touches things this would bring.</p>
<p><iframe title="BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hndnB0ZaZN4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Bravely Default’s title is a nod to the game’s innovative combat system. On top of the standard turn-based affair that older gamers will remember from Final Fantasy in the 1990s, we have what is effectively a turn gambling feature. During battle you have a given number of battle points (BP), which you spend to take turns. Defaulting (defending) gives you an additional BP, while Braving lets you use multiple BP to stack consecutive back-to-back turns. The gamble is that you can immediately take four turns per player on your first turn, which effectively gives the enemy three turns to try to kill you while you recover your BP.</p>


<p>Sadly, this quickly gets stale as battle devolves into just figuring out how best to stack your 16 actions in the shortest time possible. The game gets significantly better once you drop the encounter rate to 50%. There’s also a Special Attack (limit break) system, but because it resets every time you upgrade your weapons, and they trigger on some really stupid things like using 10 items, the first time I triggered it was 20 hours into the game. This feature is practically worthless.</p>
<p>Putting the unique aspects of the game aside, everything that follows is your standard fare: four would-be adventurers (plus a fairy called Airy) go on a walk to pray to some fancy crystals so the world doesn’t end. You know the story — you’ve played it a bunch of times already. All the usual tropes are there too: there’s a bunch of different jobs you can take on to change your stats (and outfits); the baddies are so bad that even the baddies are looking at each other like ‘are you for real?’; the healer of your party is the most obviously sheltered person in the world; and there’s a lecherous pervy character who only ever talks about women and sex. It’s basically every conversation with him and he’s in every goddamn conversation. Oh, and to try and make him more likeable, he’s an amnesiac whose name is… Ringabel. Truly, this game is aimed exclusively at 14-year-old boys.</p>
<p>For a game from the 2010s, the characters are remarkably one-dimensional. The plot is basic and it really drags for the first 20 or so hours. It picks up later on, but do you really want to spend half a working week to get to something passable? Probably not.</p>

<p>This brings us to the remastered bits. Flying Fairy HD Remaster brings a couple of new features that improve on the original experience, though the biggest part of any remaster is going to be with the graphical improvements. The watercolour backdrops are gorgeous, the towns look great (if comically small), and the spruced up Chibi-like character models are decent. The music is awesome, too.</p>
<p>However, there’s also plenty more that Square Enix could have done. There are some issues with the brim of the stupidly large Black Mage hat occasionally clipping through things, and annoying issues like mouths being thin black circles on an otherwise skin-coloured head (think Lego games if the mouths weren’t coloured in), but these aren’t the most glaring shortcomings. The biggest issue is that enemies didn’t get the same care and attention as the main cast. Sure, in general they’re keeping with the low-poly aesthetic of what the 3DS could handle and some do look good, but there’s plenty that just seem to have sharper polygons than before. Great, now we get to look at crisper, sharper triangles? This could have gone further, while retaining the same visual tone and feel.</p>

<p>Since features like adjusting the random battle rate and speeding up combat were already in the original game, what else has this remaster been able to do? Well, there’s a new UI, but that’s par for the course when moving from a dual screen to a single screen. There’s also reworked online features in that you can send AI versions of your characters to your friends, but this only works if you have friends who play the game. Lastly, there’s the addition of two new minigames that have virtually no impact on the game.</p>
<p>Both use the new Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode. The first is a rhythm game that is, to be blunt, the worst rhythm game I’ve played in a very long time. You simply move your controllers to make a laser trap that collects most of the notes, and then occasionally click on the note if the game is feeling frisky — or click with both controllers if it’s a particularly difficult move. It’s pretty rubbish.</p>

<p>The second minigame is a fair bit more involved — it’s the direct inversion of the first game. This sees you fly your ship through a predetermined course, using the controllers to steer the ship along the X and Y axes, while also adjusting the AC, using a fly swatter, fixing broken fuses and playing with the radio, all at your utterly useless companions’ request. This makes for a nice tech demo, but it gets pretty stale very quickly — especially as you have to go back to playing the game to unlock more courses.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-considering-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-and-studios-acquisition/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would split itself into two entities by mid-2026. The first one, WBD Global Networks, will remain focused on the company's traditional cable programming with sports, news, and entertainment; the second entity, WBD Streaming and Studios, will spin off with HBO, the TV series and movie production, as well as the gaming division of Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>
<p>Many analysts have identified the possible motive behind the split in a potential sale of the latter, way more successful side of company. Now, just a few days after the announcement, the wrestling scoop website SEScoops <a href="https://www.sescoops.com/news/buyer-eyeing-warner-bros-new-streaming-spin-off-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> Sony is already considering purchasing WBD Streaming and Studios.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this would make perfect sense for Sony from a strategic standpoint. It would considerably bolster its movie, TV series, and gaming production and give it access to some of the biggest intellectual properties in entertainment, such as the DC universe, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WBD-split-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, it's all a bit premature at this stage since the split will have to happen first. As such, even if an acquisition deal is eventually reached, it may not be announced until 2027 or thereabouts. Regarding the legitimacy of the source, SEScoops has a long track record when it comes to wrestling leaks, but it's still worth taking the rumor with a big grain of salt.</p>
<p>Moving to analyze the gaming side, we know Warner Bros. Discovery has suffered <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy losses</a> in that division. Despite the massive success of Hogwarts Legacy, several other games failed, such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Gotham Knights, and MultiVersus. Moreover, the historic studio Monolith was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>, and its original Wonder Woman game was canceled.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of a restructuring within Warner Bros. Games around its four key IPs: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, and Mortal Kombat. It's hard to say whether Sony's acquisition would improve this division's situation in any meaningful way. Gamers probably shouldn't be too concerned about those games becoming PlayStation exclusive, though; they are simply too big to make sense as exclusives. Sony has already realized that when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed</a> Bungie to continue making multiplatform games following its acquisition.</p>

            <p><a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/71">Patch 6.2 is out now</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, and it continues the trend we've seen recently of pairing substantial and useful fixes for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> with seemingly niche and (to me) incredibly interesting things, and also has vampire knights with swords in it. Stop trying to make me excited about your videogame again, you dastards. Took me months to wean myself off of it in preparation for the very sweaty week I've got planned when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">Tides Of Torment</a> releases.</p>

<p>There's a lot here, so I've composed the following very useful bullet pointed list of what I consider the big ticket items. If I miss something you consider important, you are free to do a useless three year creative writing degree then become a depressed alcoholic and a failed poet then freelance for small websites for pennies for a year then become a freelancer for seven years and then get a job at RPS and write your own news piece about the patch and also still occasionally slip back into alcoholism, but in a fun and cool way because you can afford it now. Or just let me know in the comments because I like talking about Warhammer. Here's the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The game file size is 27% smaller, clocking in at 82.16gb install size.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Magic items have been massively reworked to be rarer but more powerful, so you'll end up with less but better items.</strong> There's also some new rare items, including the super rare and destructive but powerful Books Of Khorne. They're so rare, actually, that no-one seems to have discovered what they do yet, but they seem analogous to the Sword Of Khaine or the spooky crown I can't remember the name of right now.</li>
<li><strong>The Chaos Dwarfs get Hobgoblin Bolt Throwers, and the Vampire Counts get Blood Knights with sword and shield. </strong></li>
<li><strong>2D portholes have been spiffed up. Huzzah! </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There's also two new toggleable AI options. The good kind of AI, obviously. Not the type that I convinced earlier to agree with me that sticking your head in buckets of cold lemur sick as a substitute for ice baths is a great new trend for those who want to self-actualise and crush their goals. From the blog:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>AI Strength &amp; Threat Assessment - Default ON - When checked, campaign difficulty settings are overridden so that AI factions are always better at assessing threats based on strength and proximity of rivals, in addition to having generally increased hostility towards unknown factions. Enabling this setting is equivalent to the setup from CAI BETA 1.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Minor Faction Potential - Default OFF - When checked, minor factions make better campaign decisions, increasing their tendency to survive longer and have a bigger impact on campaigns. Enabling this setting is equivalent to the setup from CAI BETA 2.</li></ul></blockquote>
<p>This is all almost, <em>almost</em> enough to make me want to jump back in, but I promised myself I'd hold out until Tides Of Torment. We're due a third faction reveal next month. It'll be nice to see the High Elves again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We need a Switch 2 version"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>As you might recall, earlier this year Mojang lifted the lid on a new visual graphics upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> known as 'Vibrant Visuals'.</p>
<p>It's now officially released this update alongside its new 'Chase the Skies' drop, but as many Nintendo players have noted, there's no sign of the new visual refresh in the Switch trailer.</p>
<p>This likely won't come as a surprise if you follow Minecraft or know about its history on the Switch, but some fans still appear to be upset this particular update hasn't made it into a Nintendo version of the game (<em>at least yet</em>) – with many now calling for a "Switch 2 Edition" or update:</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NinjAsierX: "We need a Switch 2 version free for those who already had it in the original Switch"</p>
<p>Silverfish003: "Make a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Mojang! Mouse controls would be AMAZING!"</p>
<p>Zachhigherfructose8552: "Switch 2 version with Vibrant Visuals when?"</p>
<p>Browseph: "IM CRYING NOW!!! NO VIBRANT VISUALS ON SWITCH 2"</p>
<p>Z-Man7: "Definitely needs a performance update for Switch 2"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vibrant Visuals is described as Minecraft's biggest "official" visual refresh to date, which enhances everything you see in the game but doesn't impact the gameplay or the mechanics (it can also be toggled on and off).</p>
<p>Hopefully, developer Mojang is already working on (or at least investigating) a Switch 2 release. In the original Vibrant Visuals announcement, the team said the aim was to eventually bring this graphical update to "as many devices as possible" in the future.</p>
<figure><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c38b575564b4b/minecraft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mojang</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, here's the content you can expect to see in the Switch version of this new Minecraft update. You can find out more in our previous coverage and over on the Minecraft website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This drop not only brings an exciting flying mount to Minecraft but opens up the skies for exploring, building – and more. Raise your ghastling with care and it'll let you soar with friends above the clouds once fully grown. Build high into the sky, leash a caravan of camels together, uncover a new music disc, find wandering friends with the Player Locator bar, and more."</p>

<p>Nintendo's new mobile service for Hyrule</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> on the Switch 2, Nintendo added a special service to its mobile app called <strong>Zelda Notes</strong> – giving players multiple features to enhance their time in Hyrule.</p>
<p>This service includes navigation assistance, voice memories, autobuild sharing, item sharing, and much more. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, we couldn't help but feel a lot of these useful features should have been implemented in-game, but it's now got us wondering how everyone else is finding this optional extra a few weeks later.</p>
<p>Are you still using it? Have you used this service at all? Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments. It's worth noting this app is exclusive to the Switch 2 editions of these games and doesn't require a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use.</p>

<p>Here's what's included</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has been doing a lot behind the scenes over the past few weeks to update many of its major first-party Switch titles for the Switch 2. This includes both free and paid upgrades for select titles, and alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> update today, Nintendo has also released a patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>This bumps the latest version of Mario Party up to Version 2.0.0 and follows on from an update released in November last year. This latest update contains a bunch of "general updates" resolving multiple bugs. Here's the full rundown according to Nintendo's support page:</p><p><figure data-videoid="XT_vmJEKdkw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_vmJEKdkw"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_vmJEKdkw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree: Ver. 2.0.0 (Released June 17, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where users are sometimes unable to get the “Defeat Imposter Bowser for the first time.” achievement when Bowser Kaboom Squad ends.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the game can no longer progress when specific operations are performed in “Party-Planner Trek.”</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where CPUs could be controlled by unused but connected controllers in certain minigames.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in “Jr.'s Jauntlet” where players were pushed out of bounds by Thwomp’s attack.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in “Three Throw” where players would sometimes not get a point after scoring a goal.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the “Mushroom Tickets” item would disappear after one use under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed some other issues to make the gaming experience more pleasant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>To download this patch, you can either boot up the game to prompt the update or manually install it by entering the software settings on the Home menu and performing a "software update".</p>
<p>This follows some other fixes in November and October of last year, closer to the Switch version's release. If you want to know what exactly this title has to offer on the Switch 2, you can check out our hands on:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nexus-mods-owners-scramble-to-assuage-community-concerns-following-sale-by-burnt-out-founder.1221447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nexus-mods-new-owners-chosen-monetization<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a PC gamer who even sometimes considers installing user-made mods, you’ve almost certainly visited <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. There are other sites, sure, and Steam has incorporated mods directly into its client via the Steam Workshop, but Nexus Mods remains the place where the modding community congregates – where awe-inspiring ambition and somehow even more awe-inspiring horniness give rise to countless feats of ingenuity. Yesterday, Robin “Dark0ne” Scott, who founded the site 17 years ago, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he’d sold his pride, joy, and source of near-constant stress. Little would change, he claimed, but provided few concrete details beyond that – not even the name of the company that purchased the site. So the community went digging, and they did not like what they unearthed.&nbsp;</p><p>Nexus Mods’ new owners, as it turns out, hail from a company called Chosen. If nothing else, it <a href="https://wearechosen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bills itself</a> as a less-terrible alternative to venture capital and private equity, but it still very much speaks in terms of scale and monetization. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/nexus-mods-new-owners-promise-they-wont-monetise-the-site-to-death-as-users-panic-at-the-whiff-of-venture-capital-the-new-owners-are-here-not-sitting-in-a-distant-tower-remotely-directing-us-all-towards-some-nefarious-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to PC Gamer</a>, Nexus Mods users were also dismayed to discover that the LinkedIn page of one of Chosen’s founders, Victor Folmann, featured a “<a href="https://imgur.com/ztjS4K7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming Startup Monetization Cheat Sheet</a>” littered with red flags: blurbs on ads, pay-to-earn, pay-to-play, microtransactions, and NFTs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ensuing panic led to a response from one of the new owners, seemingly Folmann going by the handle Foledinho, on Scott’s original announcement post – the comments section of which has been disabled multiple times since the post went live yesterday. In it, Folmann shoots down a barrage of accusations, saying mods will remain free, creators will continue to own mods, free accounts won’t be restricted in any new ways, and that while ads are a “necessary trade-off to keep the site running,” he hopes to “reduce them over time, not increase them.”&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of overall monetization, Folmann said he believes Nexus Mods did it “right” back in the day with premium memberships, saying there are no plans to “change the core of how premium works.” But he added ominously that “hosting billions of mod files and running the infrastructure behind Nexus Mods isn’t cheap” and, in response to a question about additional monetization, did not shoot down the idea.</p><p>“Monetization is hard and Nexus Mods is a complex platform,” he wrote. “What matters most is continuing to support mod authors, delight users, and keep the lights on. We’re not changing the core model. No aggressive monetization. No paid mods. If anything, we’re aiming for fewer ads, not more. We’ll take a community-first, listening approach, and we won’t compromise on what’s made Nexus Mods special.”</p><p>Speaking to PC Gamer, a Nexus Mods spokesperson echoed the business-as-usual sentiment: "Our focus is on continuity, not disruption. We have a very experienced team here of 40 highly talented people, with tons of modding experience and a deep history with the community and this is not changing. The new owners are here, embedded in the team, working with us all directly, not sitting in a distant tower, remotely directing us all towards some nefarious goals."&nbsp;</p><p>This mirrors what Scott said in his original announcement post:</p><p>“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott wrote. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era. … In terms of new faces, you’ll also be seeing more of Foledinho (Victor), Rapsak (Marinus) and Taagen (Nikolai), who’ve come on board to lead this next chapter. They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”</p><p>So then why not even mention Chosen by name prior to community inquiries? The new owners say they wanted to give Scott – who will, confusingly, still sort of be around in what sounds like an advisory capacity – a proper sendoff.</p><p>“This post wasn’t about Chosen,” wrote Folmann. “It was about Robin and the legacy he built over 24 years. We’re the new owners and ultimate decision-makers at Nexus Mods. We’ll share more about ourselves when we’ve earned that right. For now, we’re focused on listening, learning, and making modding even easier, and yes, you’ll see us around in the community being active. Trust takes time. We're committed to putting control back in the hands of creators, players, and communities. We’ll get back to building now.”</p><p>The “putting control <em>back </em>in the hands of creators, players, and communities” line could be a general statement of intent, but it could also be referencing a whole other course in this can-of-worms feast: the Nexus Mods community’s years-spanning debate over diversity and inclusion, specifically in regard to its ban on mods that remove inclusive elements, like pronoun choices, "when the removal is clearly to be divisive or cause hostility within the community or marginalize specific group(s)."&nbsp;</p><p>Nexus Mods put its foot down on the issue back in 2022 following a mod that removed Pride flags from <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em>, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott writing at the time</a> that “We are for inclusivity, we are for diversity. If we think someone is uploading a mod on our site with the intent to deliberately be against inclusivity and/or diversity then we will take action against it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since then, the site has been under fire for supposed “censorship” from vocal (though not necessarily representative) members of the modding community, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ5of-BMAnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usual suspects like Asmongold</a>. This despite a relatively middle-of-the-road stance from Scott, who, for example, recently pointed out that the removal of a Donald Trump <em>Marvel Rivals</em> mod corresponded with the same action being taken against a corresponding Joe Biden mod.&nbsp;</p><p>“We also removed the exact same mod with Joe Biden's head at the same time… to ensure there was no bias and because we don't want to handle all the nutjobs that come out the woodwork whenever these mods get posted. Funny how the outrage-bait YouTubers don't mention that, isn't it?” Scott wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nexusmods/comments/1hv0moo/anyone_else_sick_and_tired_of_nexus_mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a thread on the Nexus Mods subreddit in January</a>. “It's so dumb, and these people are so dumb, that I really cannot be fucked with it. I'm not expecting any of my staff to have to handle these whackjobs any more than showing them the door either. So we delete all the mods we see/that get reported to us on the topic, and all the people this upsets can trot-on because it's really not worth our time or effort to care about.”</p><p>The question now is, will Nexus Mods maintain these sorts of hardline stances without Scott at the helm? At the moment, it’s unclear. Aftermath reached out to two of the site’s new owners, as well as multiple official email addresses and one moderator, for more information about future plans on that front, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, the site’s moderators continue to open and close the comments section on Scott’s sale announcement thread each day in the name of “healthy debate.”</p><p>"We appreciate the thoughtful and (mostly) respectful discussion that took place here around this news announcement," a Nexus Mods moderator <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted today</a>. "It's always good to see people engaging with different perspectives, even on hot-button topics like moderation and censorship. Unfortunately, the thread has gradually crossed from spirited discourse into spirited chaos. Some comments have gone off the rails, some have gone off-topic, and a few tried to jump the rails entirely. While some of you have appreciated a lighter touch in this comment section, others have expressed dismay that a heavier hand has not been applied. Regardless of your view, thanks for the always interesting and often insightful views being shared. Rather than let this carry on through our night unattended, comments will be disabled temporarily, but the gates will open once again tomorrow."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song"><h3>New Scylla Songs!</h3></a><p>"Now we've got you in our tentacles"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online"><h3>Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025</h3></a><p>Kat Abughazaleh's Congressional campaign wants to reach people both locally and online</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
