That's a very good start for a game considering the AAA titles it's competing with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> RoadCraft Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To a certain extent, RoadCraft is a crafting game, except it stays close to reality. Players can't simply take short cuts and skip past the clean up stage. Once the debris has been taken away, the rebuilding process begins. Laying down new roads is a part of that, but not the end. RoadCraft is designed to let the players decide where everything should go, and how they want to put it there.</p><p>RoadCraft allows players to utilize cranes, haulers, bulldozers, and other machines either solo or alongside up to three other players while coordinating with voice chat. Progression is shared and the game also supports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a>.</p><p>There are eight different maps to reshape to your whims, included forested areas and deserts. Players can fully develop these locations or take a more minimal approach with the rebuild. It's entirely up to you, once the game is in your hands.</p><p>RoadCraft is currently on sale at Fanatical for $35.59, 11% off its regular price of $40. It's also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p><p><em><i>Disclosure: Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom</i>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 2020 launch, to the point where players can't wait for what CD Projekt RED has coming next in the sequel currently codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-evolve-much-like-the-witcher-games-in-cdprs-plans/">Project Orion</a>.</p>
<p>According to the creator behind the Cyberpunk series the games are based on, Mike Pondsmith, CD Projekt RED will have a whole new city for players to explore, on top of the infamous Night City that players have already spent hours digging into.</p>
<p>Pondsmith revealed the second city during Digital Dragons 2025, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-features-a-second-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-reveals-creator/">VGC</a>) saying, "<em>I'm not as involved directly, but I see the scripts. Last week I was wandering around talking to different department and seeing what they had, like 'this is new Cyberware, what do you think?' I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place...because there's another city that we visit, and I'm not telling you anymore than that, but there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you're going for, and this really does work, it doesn't feel like Blade Runner</em>," he continued. "<em>It feels more like Chicago gone wrong.' And I said, 'yeah, I can see this working</em>."</p>
<p>It's exciting to consider that we'll have all of Night City, and then a whole new city, potentially even around the same size, to explore in Project Orion/whatever the final official title of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will be. But it'll be a long time before we see it, since CD Projekt RED still has to get through<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-new-saga-pre-production-witcher-remake-cyberpunk-sequel-concept/"> The Witcher 4</a> before it heads back to Cyberpunk.</p>

            <p>
Alright, so, I know those of us on PC haven't even had the chance to play the first one yet, but it seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/shift-up-corporation">Shift Up</a> have essentially confirmed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> 2 is in the works. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/">Insider Gaming</a>, Shift Up recently shared its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">investor relations presentation</a> for May of this year, most of it being businessy nonsense neither you or I could give two tosses about. The key thing is a slide in its strategy section, showing a very basic plan for its games Nikke and Stellar Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On Stellar Blade's section, it shows a label titled "platform expansion", presumably in reference to that upcoming PC port. There's also a bit that just plainly says "sequel", which, I don't know about you, certainly implies that a sequel is likely to be in the works. This section also shows that all of these steps are being taken between 2024, i.e. the original release year of Stellar Blade, and 2027, seeming to suggest that Shift Up plan to release a sequel by then.
</p>
<p>
On top of that there's the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-studios-next-game-reportedly-aaa-action-rpg-titled-project-witches">previously reported Project Witches</a> listed, also seemingly due out before 2027. Not many details on that one still, but it appears to be early days still as another section notes that there's only 18 people working on it currently compared to the 107 devs working on Stellar Blade, and 148 devs working on Nikke. Worth noting this might have changed by now, as these figures are as of March 2025, either way, you probably shouldn't expect a proper reveal of that for a while.
</p>
<p>
Whether the sequel comes to PC whenever it launches, I couldn't tell you, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game is due out for us in less than a month. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blade-pc-will-release-on-11th-june-according-to-leaked-trailer-montage-of-technical-improvements">You'll be able to pick it up on PC on June 11th</a>, though not necessarily everywhere, as it's currently region locked. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellar-blades-devs-would-like-you-to-know-you-dont-need-a-psn-account-on-pc-as-they-work-on-the-region-lock-problem">Shift Up is working on fixing that at least</a>!

                <p>According to leakers and data miners, code for double jumping and wall-running has been added to Call of Duty with the latest update, but it remains unclear if this will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> or Call of Duty 2025, if used at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Several reliable Call of Duty accounts on X: <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1924770383665745976" rel="nofollow ">CharlieIntel</a>, <a href="https://x.com/thebluefoxvn/status/1924328399679697079" rel="nofollow ">AndrewVN</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1924347527991541904" rel="nofollow ">COD Warfare</a>, all shared a look at the code in the new update, as well as video of it in action. It's important to note that the double jump and wall-running are not live in the actual game but instead are being demonstrated by someone who activated the code that was added. The movement looks similar to the movement in Black Ops 3, which originally introduced the controversial wall-running mechanic. It's been confirmed that a Black Ops 3 map, Fringe, is being remade for Black Ops 6 as part of Season 4. The map may not work without wall-running or significant changes, providing a possible reason for these being added.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what exactly this is being planned for, if it's going to be used at all, is unclear. It could be leftover code; it could be for a special mode in Black Ops 6 or used in this year's Call of Duty. While unannounced, it is rumored that Call of Duty 2025 is Black Ops 7 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-will-be-black-ops-2-sequel-report/1100-6520054/">sequel to Black Ops 2</a>. Black Ops 2 had a near future sci-fi setting, but with the sequel coming out the same year the game was set, it would likely get bumped to a farther out date. It would make sense that the futuristic Call of Duty game brought back the futuristic mechanics of wall-running and double jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">The code was found as part of the most recent update to Call of Duty, which prepares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Warzone and Black Ops 6 for Season 4</a>, set to release on May 29.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone are set to expand in a big way this week with the arrival of Season 4. In this post, we're running through everything that's announced and rumored so far, including new weapons, more maps, a possible wall-running feature, and more. The full blog post covering everything that's new in Season 4 will be released on May 21, but for now, here's everything we know.</p><h2 id="Season_4_release_date"><strong>Season 4 release date</strong></h2><p>Season 4 for Black Ops 6 and Warzone will launch on May 29.</p><h2 id="Season_4_story_trailer">Season 4 story trailer</h2><p>Each new Call of Duty season continues the ongoing narrative, and that's no different for Season 4. In the new season, players can expect the return of a popular character--<a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Vikhor_%22Stitch%22_Kuzmin" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stitch</a>.</p><p>"After a daring black site breakout staged by Adler, he strikes a deal with the devil.

It's expected to be just one of at least a few new maps, as Activision normally releases multiple new maps with each new season.</p><h2 id="New_operator"><strong>New operator</strong></h2><p>As the new cinematic alludes to, Season 4 is adding Stitch as a playable character, and he looks quite menacing. Also coming in Season 4 are a group of new skins for Adler. There could be more operators and more skins, and we'll find out soon when Activision releases all the new details for Season 4.</p><h2 id="Battle_pass"><strong>Battle pass</strong></h2><p>Of course, Season 4 will introduce a new battle pass. And while it hasn't been revealed yet, completing it will yield a rad new skin for Stitch that you can see below.</p><h2 id="New_weapons"><strong>New weapons</strong></h2><p>Each new Call of Duty season typically adds more weapons for everyone, and that seems to be the case for Season 4. Detonated reports that the LC10 and FFAR from Black Ops Cold War are coming to Black Ops 6, while the Essex Model 07 from Black Ops 4 is reportedly on the way as well. A pickaxe melee item is coming as well, it appears.</p><h2 id="Double_jump_and_wall_running_"><strong>Double-jump and wall-running?</strong></h2><p>Are we getting wall-running in Call of Duty before GTA 6? It seems like it's possible, as people have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-most-recent-black-ops-6-update-contains-double-jump-and-wall-running-code-but-its-not-being-used-yet/1100-6531692/" data-ref-id="1100-6531692">discovered a double-jump command in the game's code</a>, while players can also seemingly run on walls. It's possible this is leftover code and isn't representative of anything coming to Black Ops 6 or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-leak-suggests-a-black-ops-2-sequel-and-tranzit-return/1100-6530848/" data-ref-id="1100-6530848">new Call of Duty later this year.</a> But people are theorizing that Activision might add a limited-time mode in Season 4 that tests the waters for double-jumps and wall-running.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><p dir="ltr">A double jump type moment has been found in Black Ops 6 files after recent update.

            <p>
Carrie Patel, who served as game director on this year's acclaimed fantasy action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, has confirmed her departure from Obsidian Entertainment after nearly 12 years with the studio and announced a new role at Netflix.
</p>
<p>
Patel, who was very much the face of Avowed throughout its development, shared the news in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-patel-80003aa/">brief update on LinkedIn</a>, revealing she's now working within Netflix's gaming division, having joined Oxenfree developer Night School Studio as a game director.
</p>
<p>
She offered no further clue as to what she'll be working on at Night School in her update, but the Oxenfree and Afterparty studio has an impressive track record, despite its limited output since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">acquired by Netflix in 2021</a>. It released Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals in 2023 but nothing else until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-you-might-not-even-notice-it">Black Mirror tie-in Thronglets</a> arrived earlier this year - a release that followed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">unspecified number of layoffs at Night School</a> in March.

<p>
Netflix's gaming strategy has taken some dramatic shifts in direction since the streaming service's first tentative steps back in 2021. After an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">initial focus on mobile titles</a>, it seemed ready to stride into the world of AAA console gaming in 2023, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">hitting up longtime Halo creative lead Joseph Staten</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and God of War art director Rafael Grassetti to found a new development team.
</p>
<p>
However, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">quietly closed the studio late last year</a>, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">reportedly now focusing on</a> narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller. That does, of course, still leave room for Night Studio - and Patel - to continue making the kind of games it does best.
</p>
<p>
As for Avowed, prior to Patel's departure from Obsidian, she suggested it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-director-hints-at-a-future-for-the-franchise">wasn't a one-and-done effort</a>. "Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world," she explained, "I'd love to see us do more with it." Next up for Obsidian, though, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2. It's due later this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">special developer deep dive set to air on 8th June</a> following the Xbox Games Showcase.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-love-letter-to-the-suplex-wrestling%E2%80%99s-greatest-move.1194486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the international wrestling community, one of the go-to icebreaker questions is asking a fellow fan about their Mt. Rushmore of professional wrestlers. One’s Mt. Rushmore of wrestlers is shaped by wrestling eras, match quality, and nostalgia for iconic performers, all without crowning one over the others. While my Mt. Rushmore shifts from month to month, I’ll never change my mind on the wrestling move I fuck with more than the other 1,000 holds in wrestling: the suplex.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suplex</a> is a wrestling maneuver where a wrestler lifts their opponent into a bridging position before slamming them onto the mat. While it might seem like a basic throw, its deceptive simplicity allows for a wide range of physical expression. Wrestling moves — like words on a webpage — come in different fonts, each infused with a unique style. Before I wax poetic about my favorite suplexes, I will set the stage explaining how wrestling moves come in more permutations than Fanta flavors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wrestling Moves For Dummies</h2><p>Suplexes and fundamental moves like drivers, powerbombs, busters, and splashes are the bedrock of a wrestler’s arsenal. While anyone can do them, how they're delivered truly sets them apart. A performer’s gimmick, technical prowess, and artistic flair can turn one of these simple maneuvers into a spectacle worth popping out of your chair in unbridled excitement.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Undertaker Finisher - Tombstone Piledriver" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyJKrP7L-kM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsdG0HyLHP0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Undertaker’s Tombstone Piledriver</a>. It’s a devastating finisher that the WWE’s “Deadman” has performed for three decades because it wins him matches. It begins with a signature throat slash gesture, signaling to the crowd that his opponent is about to meet his end. Taker then flips a dude upside down, cradling their head between his thighs, and spikes them headfirst into the mat. He then methodically crosses their arms like they’re being prepped for a funeral (because they are), and rolls his eyes back at the hard cam — holding the pose unti the referee’s three count seals their kayfabe fate.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kenta Kobashi debuts the burning hammer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuEoimAW604?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite the Tombstone Piledriver being a certified “move I wouldn’t want to take,” it's far from the riskiest in the grand scheme of wrestling drivers. There’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLkN6p0Mqf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Package Piledriver</a>, where a wrestler locks their opponent tightly upside down in the feeble position before drilling them into the mat; the <a href="https://youtu.be/mqDZRZVw4jo?si=qSmNUPKs0e3ZWP5r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian Destroyer</a>, a piledriver variant where a wrestler front flips while holding their opponent before driving their head into the ground; or, my personal favorite, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah2e64-VcxQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenta Kobashi’s Burning Hammer</a>, an inverted twist on the Death Valley Driver where instead of flipping his opponent onto their back from a fireman’s carry drop, he spikes them neck-first into the canvas.&nbsp;</p><p>When a wrestler masters a move, it becomes one of their signature moves. If a move reliably results in their victory, it becomes their finishing move. Over time, that move earns a legacy by renaming its modification and variation after the person who perfected it, passing it on to a new generation of wrestlers to add to their toolkits, like <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=455&amp;gimmick=Jushin+Thunder+Liger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jushin Thunder Liger</a>’s sit-out powerbomb the “Liger Bomb,” or <a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mitsuharu Misawa</a>’s double underhook powerbomb the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Wrestling_throws#Tiger_driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Driver</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Suplexes come in different shapes and sizes</h2><p>As mentioned above, wrestling moves are like fonts. But the real magic happens with a move’s modifiers. Like how text can be bolded, italicized, or underlined to change its impact, wrestling moves transform depending on speed, elevation, and execution. And the anatomy of a suplex has a plethora of variations.&nbsp;</p><p>If a wrestler executes a suplex from the top turnbuckle, it transforms into an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srq6iNLtOxo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“avalanche” suplex</a>. If they burst into the suplex without a drawn-out wind-up, prioritizing speed over theatrics, it’s classified as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggn0Ubi6uks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“snap” suplex</a>. Sitting between these two variants is the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws#Brainbuster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainbuster</a>, a suplex with a distinctly brutal twist.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brainbuster, often called a <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Vertical_Suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delayed Vertical Suplex</a>, begins with the wrestler locking their opponent in a front face lock — one hand gripping their hip, the other tucked behind their neck. Unlike a standard suplex that follows a graceful arc, a Brainbuster cuts the rotation short. Instead of rolling into a controlled fall, the wrestler delays the drop and spikes their opponent straight down onto their head in a sheer whiplash-inducing impact.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Top 20 Variations of the Brainbuster" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BN1CHgRialI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>My Favorite Suplexes</h2><p>Now that I’ve thoroughly explained the ins and outs of wrestling throws and the variations of suplexes, here are my all-time favorite suplexes in no particular order.&nbsp;</p><h2>Northern Lights Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Alicia Fox- Northern Lights Suplex" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJbBP5f3f2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Key qualities for a grade-A <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#German_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northern Lights Suplex</a> are how fluid the rolling motion of the throw is, how high the arch of the offensive wrestler’s bridge is, and most importantly, whether they point their toes into the ground and maintain their balance while executing the move. My favorite Northern Lights Suplex belongs to WWE’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Fox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicia Fox</a>. Her bridge is beautiful, and she makes the move look like a walk in the park.&nbsp;</p><h2>German Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Konosuke Takeshita's German Suplex Collection (110+ Clips)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYHx_Dc1ByI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I said I wasn’t picking favorites here, but the <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#German_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">German Suplex</a> is my favorite. I pop off when I see it in other media, like <a href="https://youtu.be/_H0Vf16JYHI?t=1460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kratos taking an impromptu German Suplex from Baldur in <em>God of War</em></a>. I’m such a slut for a German Suplex that I hoot any time any wrestler executes any kind of variation of this suplex. It can be a deadlift German Suplex, a pop-up German Suplex, or a rolling German Suplex, I don’t care. It’s just something about watching a wrestler slipping under their opponent’s guard, locking their arms around their waist, and snapping their hips into a golden ratio arc into the mat that pleases the caveman wrinkles in my brain. It fucks. Though if I were to pick a favorite wrestler’s German Suplex, it would be my <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/konosuke-takeshita-and-cinnabon-greatest-love-story-wrestling?utm_source=TW-Fightful&amp;utm_medium=Fightful%20Wrestling%20News&amp;utm_campaign=dlvr.it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cinanbon-loving son</a>, Konosuke Takeshita, who <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/1104609/facts-only-hardcore-fans-know-about-konosuke-takeshita/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a 20-page college thesis on the move</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dragon Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mayu Iwatani - Bridging Dragon Suplex compilation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJ-69MKqIUs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#Dragon_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Suplex</a> is synonymous with Former Stardom-turned Marigold Ace Joshi pro wrestler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayu_Iwatani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayu Iwatani</a>. The move is like a standard German suplex but has stages like the Power Rangers assembling the Megazord. First, she props her opponent up in a belly-to-back suplex position. While having them suspended in the air, she locks them in a full nelson and snaps them back, neck-first into the mat. Sometimes, if she’s feeling fancy, Iwatani will bridge her back and point her toes into the ground. However, it doesn’t happen often because Iwatani is a sicko who goes incredibly hard in her matches, often crumpling into a heap after delivering super kicks, so she’ll sometimes just settle for hitting the move and crumpling in exhaustion until the three-count sounds her victory.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tiger Suplex</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Perfect Tiger Suplex from Tiger Mask IV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBX-FAKf2YY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Suplex#Tiger_suplex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Suplex</a> is another variant of the German Suplex. Its uniqueness lies in how wrestlers set up their opponents before slamming them into the mat. Instead of locking their opponents from their waist or from a full nelson position, the Tiger Suplex has an offensive wrestler lock their adversary from the inside of their elbow, the cubital fossa if you will, from the belly-to-back position before foisting them from the earth and dropping them from a high angle on their shoulders and neck. The kayfabe psychology of the suplex, and other moves restricting an opponent's arms, is that it would prevent them from breaking their fall, making the impact more devastating. I think it’s neat that suplexes are an equal opportunity naming convention for animals.&nbsp;</p><h2>C4 Bakudan Suplex</h2><p><a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=16564&amp;gimmick=AZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AZM</a> (pronounced Azumi)’s suplex is so complex that it has its unique name. In fighting game lingo, the <a href="https://x.com/WhirlingAndy/status/1813541450304692356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C4 Bakudan Suplex</a> (or C4 Bomb) is like a command grab counter move. After deflecting a front kick from her opponent, AZM dips under their guard while folding their kicking leg to their hip like they were crossing their legs like a cool guy. After which, she performs a German Suplex. Yes, it's just a German Suplex with the bare minimum of extra steps, but the velocity with which “High Speed Bomb Girl” executes the move gets all the brownie points from me.&nbsp;</p><h2>Twilight Dream</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tam Nakano delivers a tiger suplex setting up the debut of her "Twilight Dream" finisher. 💫</p><p>Kagetsu vs. Tam Nakano<br>STARDOM at the Korakuen Hall<br>9th Anniversary Show (January 19th, 2020) <a href="https://t.co/o6jXjUyEob">pic.twitter.com/o6jXjUyEob</a></p></div>— nimbus ✨ (@surfingnimbus) <a href="https://twitter.com/surfingnimbus/status/1601126459158200320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The Twilight Dream is one of the more complicated suplexes on this list.

The move sees the “Top Kawaii of the Cosmos” wrestler place her opponent in a combination of a hammerlock and seatbelt wrist hold, fastening their arms to the front and back of their waist, leaving no room to escape, before hoisting them up for a suplex. She typically punctuates the move by holding her back in a bridge and anchoring her tippy toes into the mat like the showoffy idol she is, and I love her for it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ocean Cyclone Suplex&nbsp;</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Manami Toyota's Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yos3DFvNRlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br><a href="https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=2265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minami Toyota</a>’s <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Manami_Toyota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ocean Cyclone Suplex</a> is what happens when a German Suplex meets an <a href="https://prowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Electric_chair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electric Chair</a> (the wrestling move).

			<p>Developer Raccoon Logic's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-tips-for-starting-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> has surpassed 1 million players, the studio has announced. Nearly two weeks since the game launched, the studio celebrated the milestone, though creative director Alex Hutchinson still lamented the fact that, due to Revenge of the Savage Planet being available on subscription services, 1 million players doesn't mean 1 million sales.</p>
<p>"<em>We are super grateful to all the 1M players who have taken up revenge against Alta</em>," a statement from Raccoon Logic on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2787320/view/537728173036537047">Steam page</a> began.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for the support. On the team side, we are continuing to make fixes very regularly to ensure that everyone has the best experience possible. We're also working on a roadmap for new features/updates/etc that we want to share with you very soon! In the meantime, keep kicking brainards, raccoons, and decking out your habitat STV Cribs Style. The team loves seeing all your creations, gifs, memes, etc. Keep em' coming!</em>"</p>

<p>On X, creative director Alex Hutchinson still celebrated the milestone, but seemingly with an upset tone that the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass means it doesn't exactly reflect the financial success that 1 million players would have meant in the days before subscription services like Game Pass.</p>
<p>"<em>In the modern world it sadly doesn't mean sales with the subscription services but still an awesome milestone</em>," Hutchinson<a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1924124703427371070"> wrote on X</a> while sharing a photo celebrating 1 million players.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">review of Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, we praised the game's style and its humor, but still found it a tedious journey that cut any momentum it was starting to build at various points in the game.</p>
<p>"<em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire.1194471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Creature Keeper</em> is a monster collector from Chicago-based studio Fervir Games, and one that went through the trenches to get here. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, and an expected release of 2021, was just the beginning of a road built piece-by-piece in real-time whilst they were traveling on it, and indeed, even now. It’s always nice to see the fruits of labor, regardless of the outcome.</p>

<p>You play as Blank, a young up-and-coming “Creature Keeper” from Thera, based in the hills of Sodland. After a grueling training period, Blank immediately has their feet put to the fire, as a growing corruption is enveloping Thera, as well as ruining the livelihoods and prospects of several nearby towns. Together with the creatures uncorrupted by this mysterious influence, Blank has to learn quickly.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that<em> Creature Keeper</em> keeps under the bonnet, namely, what exactly is being showcased. Is it a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-red-and-blue" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-esque creature collector? Is it an action-RPG in the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a> </em>vein? Is it a brawler evoking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/dynasty-warriors-fighting-game-turned-musou" rel="nofollow"><em>Dynasty Warriors</em></a>, of all things? The answer is all 3, and more, including a gardening mini-game. Inside and out, you can tell this is someone’s baby, “nurture over nature” as it gleefully sprawls out on screen like a Jackson Pollock painting.</p>



<p>This works both for <em>Creature Keeper</em>’s benefit and against it. When the game is showing you how it works in its initial throes, it’s all very contained. You’re given a creature to control, and in their own time, the AI can attack whatever’s attacking Blank. If you want to expedite the process, however, you can select the monster as the game slows down, and choose whether it’s a normal attack, a special attack that you can switch out for each separate creature, or whether they ignore that monster entirely.</p>

<p>In this contained environment, it works well. It helps that Blank is also an element in each fight, with weapons readily available and found throughout chests in Thera. Cracks start to show almost immediately however, as after the tutorial, each fight is an insane explosion of mushy pixels that cannot and will not determine separate factors in each fight you decide to take on.</p>

<p>You see, it’s not just Blank and their monsters on display, but the monsters that have been corrupted, and the monsters you can befriend that haven’t been corrupted. Then there’s the icons attached to the corrupted monsters, your owned creatures' health bars, and the damage numbers in tiny groups of pixels, and the projectiles certain monsters will fire profusely to the point of sub-5 FPS slowdown… and the hats. It’s mesmerizing, albeit completely unintelligible chaos, and that’s before you’re allowed more than one creature to follow you on your adventure.</p>



<p>There’s no real way to mitigate this. All but a small handful of creatures will have collisions on their sprites, but that’s when they showcase size on top of their massive attacks, so what you have is a melting pot of nothing. You can strategize and line up attacks for your creatures to make, but it’s tough to determine in the heat of the moment where it starts and ends, even with appropriate set-ups.</p>

<p>It’s the set-ups themselves that seem to have the primary focus in <em>Creature Keeper</em>. Creatures level up, and they unlock perks, but there are some absolutely baffling design decisions made here. Why would I want my creature to get a 10% damage buff, but an increase of 15% in damage taken? Why do HP bonuses only offer paltry +10s when my creatures can reach health that pushes 1000? Why is movement speed a bonus to consider when the creatures are strictly tethered to the player character?</p>

<p>There are also other bonuses you can attach in the form of a garden where you can plant seeds, which you can place clay figures of your current party nearby certain seeds, so you attain bonuses in battles. It’s not as explicitly black-and-white as that, but you’d be hard pressed to find the strategy involved. Even when the game introduces its Rock/Paper/Scissors mechanics for monster weaknesses and strengths, the trick lies in staggering.</p>



<p>Hit a monster enough times, and they’ll become stunned briefly, and you can wail on them, which is Blank’s job. It appears that Fervir Games anticipated this, which is why Blank’s damage doesn’t scale to the same height as the monsters you can catch, so before long, your role in the battle becomes near-negligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re still a stagger merchant, make no mistake, but as a player, you become tertiary to a creature system that only relies on numbers; numbers in power, numbers in size, neither of which demand the intricacies that <em>Creature Keeper</em> promises.</p>

<p>That isn’t a detriment, as it’s nice that the game gives enough leeway for the player to simply just play it without worrying about its largely context-less flow in battles. Indeed, it was more fun trying to see the world of Thera as Fervir have crafted it, which does lead to some interesting moments. The campaign isn’t exactly <em>Moby Dick</em>, but <em>Creature Keeper</em> pulls punches when necessary with some heartfelt decisions, ones that lean into the lore with vigor.</p>

<p>Mind you, this is when the game isn’t forcing through some unbelievably painful attempts at comedy. This may be a complaint that varies with how one perceives comedy, but each time <em>Creature Keeper</em> is attempting to make the player chortle, it is always with long-winded scenes, mixed in with unnecessary and downright annoying pixelated emojis plastering the screen. It barely adds anything to proceedings, just pure eye-rolling whenever it tries to hit you with a goofy Jerry Lewis prat-fall in 16-bit format.</p>

<h2><em>Creature Keeper</em> Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Did I have fun with <em>Creature Keeper</em>? It’s really hard to say. It’s a true “shut your brain off” button masher that doesn’t do enough with its tactical potential, and its story is sandbagged by some truly unfunny comedy beats. Beyond its mostly ineffectual perk system, what changes could be made would also poison the well of its extremely specific flavor, and as it stands, it HAS identity. As it stands, the journey <em>Creature Keeper</em> has made to be here could be worth the price of admission alone.</p>

Ultimate members can stream these games to the cloud and also play on PC. These games are not available for Game Pass Core ($10/month) subscribers, however.</p><p>Firefighting Simulator is exactly what it sounds like, which is a game that lets players fight fires in a city inspired by the North American west coast. The game features multiplayer support, along with five licensed Rosenbauer America firetrucks.</p><p>Police Simulator is also what it sounds like. Players join a fictitious American city's police force and take on tasks like enforcing parking violations and stopping drug deals. Both games are published by Astragon Entertainment.</p><p>Beyond these two releases, Microsoft has not confirmed any more additions to Game Pass for May. The month's biggest release was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p><p>In other Game Pass news, developer Rebellion's day-one Game Pass launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">Atomfall was immediately profitable and the studio is now plotting out DLC and a potential sequel. </a></p>

However, Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the <em>Cyberpunk </em>tabletop roleplaying game, which first debuted in 1988, has revealed a pretty important piece of information: Alongside returning to the capitalist hellscape of Night City, the sequel will take us to another city as well.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,197564,196805" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Speaking to Polish gaming channel tvgry at the Digital Dragons Conference in Poland, Pondsmith talked a little about the upcoming game, revealing that “Orion” will take place at least partially, though not entirely, in Night City. He described some talks he had with the CD Projekt Red team, and said that while he’s not as involved in the sequel as he was with <em>2077</em>, he can say that the game will feature a second city that is “more like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p>“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit —I’m not telling you any more than that, but there’s another city we visit,” Pondsmith said. “Night City is still there, but I remember looking at it and going, ‘yeah, I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work.’ And it doesn’t feel like <em>Blade Runner</em>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.’”</p><p>Assuming Pondsmith is being careful with his words here, this doesn’t explicitly mean <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s next game is set in Chicago specifically, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does still exist in the universe</a></span>. He describes the new location as being “like” the city, so it’s probably not the Illinois metropolis itself, and as of yet, it’s unclear in what ways the new setting will resemble Chicago. In its infrastructure? Its culture? Unbearably cold winters? We’ll find out eventually.</p><p>What I’m curious about is how much of a divide there will be between this new city and the Night City we know and love. I know exploring an old map in an open-world game might not sound that exciting, but Night City is still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">one of the most well-realized cities I’ve ever explored in a game</a></span>, and I imagine CDPR isn’t too keen to just throw all that work away if there are still stories to tell. I’m also wondering if the studio will include some kind of choice import to have the story of <em>2077</em>’s merc protagonist V referenced in the sequel according to your decisions. I don’t need a cameo from the guy, but I wouldn’t mind a drink at the Afterlife bar paying tribute to his big space heist at the end of the game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And once again, it’ll be a show focused on world premieres and exclusive new trailers with no talking heads or any other fluff. Just games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>TinyBuild Connect Date, Time, and How to Watch</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The full event will be livestreamed on Tuesday, May 27 starting at 1:00 p.m. Eastern / 12:00 p.m. Central / 10:00 a.m. Pacific. For our friends across the pond, that’s 7:00 p.m. CET. It’ll start promptly at those times and will jump right into the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/"><u>IGN.com</u></a> (our homepage)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Facebook</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitch</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s TikTok</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw?themeRefresh=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s YouTube</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not able to catch the show live, you’ll be able to watch the whole thing on our YouTube page after it finishes. Just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMre7n_HPao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>last year’s show</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What to Expect from tinyBuild Connect 2025</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be a dense show, with lots of reveals and announcements packed into less than 30 minutes. There will be a mix of premieres of previously unannounced games, new info about announced games, and updates for released titles, highlighted by upcoming titles Hello Neighbor 3, Ferocious, and Kingmakers. You can expect a new look at gameplay for both HN3 and Ferocious, while Kingmakers is getting a Steam Early Access release date announcement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Neighbor 3 was announced last year and is the latest entry in the adventure sandbox thriller series. You’ll return to the town of Raven Brooks, this time as a stranger with no ties to the town. Raven Brooks functions as a real-time sandbox simulation, where every player’s decision is the right one. It’s populated by residents who act based on their personalities, relationships, desires, and goals. The game is currently in the playtesting phase, so now seems like the right time for an update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ferocious made a strong impression during last year’s Games Baked in Germany showcase with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ferocious-official-mecha-trailer-games-baked-in-germany-showcase"><u>cinematic trailer</u></a>. Developed by Omyog, a small German team with veterans from the film and AAA game industries, the game is a survival-focused, narrative-driven FPS set on a remote island filled with dinosaurs and hostile mercenaries. Among the team is the former Level Design Director of Far Cry 3, Narrative Director of Far Cry 4, and Campaign Creative Director of Star Wars Battlefront II, so it’s safe to say it’s an experienced team.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/20/tb-connect-2025-final-artwork-1747758278474.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingmakers was revealed last year too, and it took the IGN audience by storm. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>featured it on IGN Next</u></a> because its trailer was a surprise hit, getting more than 11 million views across our social channels. Like Ferocious, it resonated thanks to its unique premise. Kingmakers is a mix of third-person shooter and RTS set in medieval Europe. You might be thinking, “How could a shooter be set in medieval times?” Well, you’re a time traveler who’s been sent to the past with modern weapons to alter the course of history. TinyBuild has confirmed that they’ll be announcing the game’s release date in Steam’s Early Access, so you can look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are some of the games you can expect to get updates, but there will be plenty more announcements and updates we can’t see coming. Tune in on May 27 to see all of it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Game preservation has grown tremendously over the last couple of years, and gaming culture brand Lost in Cult is also adding to these initiatives with a brand-new line of physical games. Aiming to do things differently, Lost in Cult is kickstarting its preservation effort with three games that will "redefine" what a physical release can be.</p><p>What's immediately noticeable here is that each of the games--Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, and Thank Goodness You're Here--are being presented with original artwork, and they'll come packaged with a variant game cover, an essay booklet, poster, and more. More importantly, each game is up-to-date with its latest version and they're all playable offline. As for the price, these are listed for roughly $80 each on the UK-based site.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497826"></a><figcaption>Lost In Cult physical editions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497827,1300-4497828,1300-4497829" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg"></figure><p>Lost in Cult added that preservation specialists Does It Play have assisted in testing the games, and each disc or cartridge features the game in its entirety at the point of release. That means no updates, no downloads, and no codes in the box.</p><p>These will be very limited releases and they'll start shipping in Q4 2025. Immortality is limited to 1,500 copies on PS5, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is limited to 3,000 copies on PS5, and Thank Goodness You're Here will be limited to 1,500 copies on PS5 and 3,000 copies on Switch. Fans of physical games can expect a tri-monthly release cadence of games for PS5 and Switch, starting in July.</p><p>This is a noticeably different approach to physical game releases for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 console</a>, as many publishers and developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-nintendo-switch-2-titles-have-the-full-game-on-the-game-card/2900-6508/">are opting to release their titles as Game Cards</a>.

<p>"It's not woke," Cockle said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>. "There's nothing woke about it. [Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome."</p><p>We're not exactly sure how Cockle might define "woke." It's a term often thrown around without any specific meaning, after all.</p><p>After a trilogy of games star starred Geralt, Cockle said, "We've seen the end of Geralt's journey," adding that he celebrates Ciri and the fact that she's the protagonist of The Witcher 4.</p><p>"If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue," Cockle said about choosing Ciri as the protagonist. "There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it."</p><p>"If you think it's woke, read the damn books--they're good, first of all. And secondly, you won't think it's so woke anymore," he said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games that will span The Witcher 4-6. All of these games will be released within a <a href="https://x.com/BigManFanelli/status/1577335568224198657" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">six-year window after The Witcher 4 launches.</a></p><p>Geralt will appear in The Witcher 4, but only in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">smaller, supporting role.</a> Game director Sebastian Kalemba told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-was-always-going-to-be-about-ciri-even-when-we-were-doing-the-wild-hunt-actually-but-dont-worry-about-geralt-definitely-hes-going-to-appear/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that it was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4 to tell its story from Ciri's perspective, building off the narrative in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p>In other news, Kalemba recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-wants-players-to-feel-the-rewards-for-their-choices/1100-6531667/" data-ref-id="1100-6531667">he wants players the rewards for their choices in The Witcher 4.</a></p><p>In addition to The Witcher 4, CD Projekt is developing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher 1 remake</a>.

            <p>
Worried the impending arrival of $80 games might price you out of your favourite hobby? Well if Borderlands 4 follows suit, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has suggested the community should just suck it up and deal with it. "If you're a real fan," he recently told a potential purchaser, "you'll find a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Pitchford made the proclamation on social media after a <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">Borderlands fan opined</a>, "Randy, [Borderlands 4] better not be $80. Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay $80 and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."
</p>
<p>
But Pitchford begged to differ. "Not my call," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">insisted</a>, before dismissing pricing concerns. "If you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlour in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
The response from Borderlands fans on social media was, unsurprisingly, swift, strong, and overwhelmingly negative. "Thanks, now I won't buy the Game even if it costs $70", one person <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1924852589121687964">wrote</a>, while another <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1924850023625318758">added</a>, "That has to be one of the worst CEO replies from recent memory." Another <a href="https://x.com/RaistlinJustice/status/1924787599610122325">called</a> Pitchford's comment "elitist [and] out of touch"; "Rich person says just find the money," another <a href="https://x.com/Obey1Cannoli/status/1924818949494944151">wrote</a>, with plenty more using <a href="https://x.com/FergusMcburgs/status/1924823182374285777">considerably stronger language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of this means Borderlands 4 <em>will</em> cost $80 dollars when it eventually arrives, but the industry certainly seems to be heading in that direction. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">got the ball rolling earlier this year</a>, when it announced a $79.99 USD price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">quick to follow</a>, confirming some Xbox game prices would rise to $79.99 at the end of 2025 - presumably in time for this year's Call of Duty.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two has relayed a more cautious approach to price increases, with CEO Strauss Zelnick recently reiterating the company's stance on variable, game-by-game pricing. While some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">speculated next year's GTA 6 might reach as much as $100</a>, one of the only confirmed prices on Take-Two's upcoming roster is Mafia: The Old Country, which costs $50. Borderlands 4 pricing details are yet to be shared.
</p>
<p>
But while customers might balk at the rising cost of games, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">recently suggested the move was inevitable</a>. "I think it was going to happen sooner or later," he explained in the wake of Mario Kart World's price reveal, "maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, that's set to launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>.

            <p>
Right, anyone in need of something that's just generally quite pleasant? I've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> ever since, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">it was revealed</a>, honestly. It's suitably strange, as per usual with the cult game maker's works, this time putting you in the position of a teenager who is constantly t-posing. There's also sandwich-making giraffes and other strange inhabitants, and you can now take a look at it yourself in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727290/to_a_T_Demo/">demo that's dropped on Steam today</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo doesn't sound particularly long, as you just get to play through its first episode. Still, sounds like enough time to get to do things like brushing your teeth, something I genuinely couldn't tell you whether that's been in a game before or not. There is also a "very cute dog"! All very nondescript stuff, but I trust Takahashi to deliver on the weirdness. Plus, your save data in the demo carries through to the full game, always a neat feature.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, a couple of songs from the game have been released too. There's <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=wy7WY8G6Do3_GdCrsmPyWg">Perfect Shape by PREP</a>, an upbeat track that wants to make sure you know you're the perfect shape (aww, thanks!). And there's the slightly chiller <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=sqwwoGAmx850yjYtNIG8aQ">Giraffe Song</a>, performed by Rebecca Sugar, i.e. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a> contributor and Steven Universe creator. Honestly, both have already hooked me, some incredibly strong earworms here that I don't think have been heard in a game since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>'s theme song. Cripes, now I'm going to be singing that to myself for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Not long to wait for the full thing now either, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">as it's due out next week on May 28th</a>.

            <p>I recently stumbled on <a href="https://dominoclub.itch.io/erostasis">Erostasis</a>, a brilliant and filthy cybernetic microgame in which you are a wiry meatpuppet created to, aha, satisfy the urges of an exceedingly backed-up bionic starship. Over the course of a very busy 20 minutes or so, you visit various self-aware ship systems and play out their kinks. The writing is clattery, theory-drenched and sensual, set to moaning electronica. The visuals are a gunky collage of seeming porno and industrial stock footage. It’s glorious. Probably don’t play it where members of the public can see.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I were to choose <em>a polar opposite of that game</em> it might be new metroidvania Mio: Memories In Orbit, which also takes place on a living ship and is as elegant and videogamey and serenely sexless as Erostasis is subversive and debauched. I really like the looks of Mio, too, for wholly different reasons, and I’m tickled pink that publishers Focus Entertainment have managed to email me about it while I’m still recovering from my Erostasis experience. </p><!--more-->

Over the course of presumably many centuries, the vessel's innards have exploded into a wilderness of cosmic vegetation.</p>
<p>The visuals take inspiration from “comics, paintings and anime”, and are set to “lo-fi beats and choral melodies”. They remind me a teeny bit of Biblical beat ‘em up El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. There’s a similar, faerie frailty to the setting, with warmly painted architecture and machinery bleaching or darkening to pencil strokes in the backdrop. Mio herself moves and fights with the aid of golden tendrils emerging from her skull. These are very much not the kinds of tendrils you encounter in Erostasis, a game in which it is generally difficult to tell one body part from another.</p>
<p>Its uncommonly artful art direction aside, Mio seems pretty routine for a metroidvania. There are abilities and modifiers to acquire, new areas or shortcuts to access with those abilities, friendly robots to repair for lore and upgrades, a bestiary of 30 enemy units, and 15 bossfights. The trailer suggests that you’ll do a lot of chaining together moves to overcome sequences of obstacles and build a combo. Again, all quite familiar, but persuasively executed.</p>
<p>Mio: Memories In Orbit launches this year, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/">the Steam page</a>. It and Erostasis join last year's seedy sarcophagus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultros">Ultros</a> in the pantheon of games set on living starships. I am fervently hoping that we’re in the middle of some kind of floral fleshcruiser renaissance. I'm trying to work out which format or genre I'd like next. Maybe a bioship life sim? Where you have to worry about cellular mitosis and deep space photosynthesis, rather than managing a crew?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
