            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-director-no-plans-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>director and Studio Zero head Katsura Hashino has revealed some rather disappointing news regarding the potential future of what we might have called the&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>In a new interview with Famitsu (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/metaphor-refantazio-director-future-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Persona Central</a> and Japanese gaming news leaker <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/82367" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ryokutya2089</a>), Hashino says that there are no "concrete plans" to make&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>into a series, although he hopes that this will happen someday.</p>

<p>Rather confusingly, however, Hashino also says that development on&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;began with a view to making "a third JRPG series alongside&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>", so presumably, either the scope of the project changed or Atlus decided against this direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sequel-director-comments-strohl.jpg?itok=g5jPjzmH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-sequel-director-comments-strohl.jpg?itok=bKD8J9eH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quite right, Strohl.</figcaption></figure><p>We can assume that if there are no plans to make&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>into a series, that also means there isn't currently a&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio 2&nbsp;</em>in the works, although that doesn't mean Studio Zero isn't working on something entirely different, of course.</p>

<p>Hoshino says that if a sequel were to be made, he might "decide that the best setting for a future [<em>Metaphor</em>] title is the Sengoku period", which, he says jokingly, would create "a JRPG with a world like the&nbsp;<em>Basara&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>He's almost certainly referring here to Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Sengoku Basara&nbsp;</em>games, hack-and-slash action titles which have a rather spotty history of Western localization. One can only imagine that this might mean a Sengoku-set&nbsp;<em>Metaphor&nbsp;</em>game could struggle to get the localization nod as well.</p>

<p>If a&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>sequel is, indeed, not currently in the works, that would come as a surprise from a business perspective at the very least; after all, the JRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up a million sales in just a few hours</a>, so a sequel seems like a no-brainer for Sega and Atlus.</p>




<p>Of course, if a sequel is in the works, it wouldn't be the first time a major Japanese developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">apparently openly lied</a> about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">not creating more games</a> in a series anytime soon. We can only hope.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metaphor-refantazio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/metaphor-refantazio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-community%E2%80%99s-most-anticipated-game-of-2025.1069413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As we gear up for 2025, the hype around upcoming games is reaching a fever pitch. There are games coming in the early part of the year like Avowed and Civilization 7 that look like potential Game of the Year candidates. Then you have titles like Borderlands 4, Fable, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A that are fanbases eager for the next adventure. Still, no game seems to have a stranglehold on the community more than Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6. And that’s why GTA 6 is Insider Gaming’s Most Anticipated Game of 2025.</p>



<p>In a member vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, it wasn’t even close. The most anticipated game category was the most lopsided of all the questions with GTA 6 receiving 87% of the vote. Death Stranding 2 came in a very distant second with 7% of the vote.</p>



<p>As far as why GTA 6 won by as much as it did, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.</p>



<p>A decade in the making and cloaked in mystery, Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster isn’t just the most anticipated release of the year, it’s poised to become a cultural phenomenon that sets the standard for open-world gaming for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of writing, all fans have had to quench their thirst for the upcoming game is the reveal trailer from 2023. Since then it’s been silent at Rockstar with various rumors taking up the bulk of the talk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game will feature</a> two characters, including the franchise’s first female protagonist named Lucia. We also know that it’s set in a fictionalized version of modern-day Florida called Leonida and features parodies of some real-life characters. Lastly, the game will launch only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Those hoping for a PC release will have to wait, similar to the launch of GTA 5.</p>



<div><p>Other than those few things, there’s really nothing else we know. What will the game’s story be about? How will Rockstar expand the gameplay? What will happen to those who have spent years in GTA Online?</p><p>All of these questions lead to GTA 6 being at the top of everyone’s minds going into 2025 when we’ll (hopefully) get confirmation of a release date sooner rather than later. That is, of course, the game does get delayed until 2026. For right now, however, it’s still scheduled for fall 2025.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-3-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Design documents for several Grand Theft Auto titles, including GTA 3, have leaked online, showing ambitious plans for the franchise.</p>



<p>According to multiple reports, the design documents date back to 2001, but were uploaded on December 17, 2024 by a GTAForums user named <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/300544-collectors-general-chat/page/123/#findComment-1072480714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FrankieLiberty</a>. According to the user, he uploaded the files because other users were selling the documents for profit.</p>



<p>The documents reveal that GTA 3 and GTA 3 Online had ambitious plans for the time, which would have included a faction system, a skill system, the ability to own properties, and more. The documents also show that Barking Dog Studios, who would be acquired by Take-Two Interactive in August 2002 and morphed into Rockstar Vancouver, were intended to be the game’s original developers. </p>



<p>As always, design documents are always overly ambitious, but the design documents are a unique glimpse into how ambitious Rockstar Games were even in the early 2000s. You can view and download the documents (at your own risk), <a href="https://archive.org/details/jane-doe-gift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>



<p>As for Rockstar Games, which is the Grand Theft Auto franchise at the time of writing, fans are eagerly awaiting the next GTA 6 trailer, which should hopefully give us a more accurate release date. At the time of writing, GTA 6 is currently scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of the design documents? Are you looking forward to GTA 6? Let us know in the comments below! Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-ceo-teases-two-new-projects-explains-project-8-shutdown.1069401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-project-8-shutdown-new-projects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał has provided some more context regarding the studio's recent cancellation of its story-based, console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, and he's also teased two new projects in the works at the studio.</p>

<p>In an interview with Polish publication <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/11-bit-studios-rozpoczelo-prace-nad-dwiema-grami-nie-planuje-emisji-akcji-wywiad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PAP Biznes</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/12/25/games-industry-severe-crisis-11-bit-studios-ceo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game World Observer</a>),&nbsp;Marszał says that the gaming industry is "going through a severe crisis" at the moment, and that 2024 was a tough year for 11 bit "in some areas".</p>

<p>As a reminder, 11 bit revealed the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">last week</a>, along with a reduction in staff that would see several of the project's developers laid off. Others, however, would apparently be reallocated to other 11 bit projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-project-8-cancellation-ceo-comments.jpg?itok=0fcecYBN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-project-8-cancellation-ceo-comments.jpg?itok=1rQfOnOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios recently canceled&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>, calling the project too risky to continue with.</figcaption></figure><p>In the PAP Biznes interview,&nbsp;Marszał says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em>'s reference points would have included the likes of Ninja Theory's&nbsp;<em>Senua&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>series; specifically, the gameplay would have been more similar to the latter than the former.</p>

<p>However,&nbsp;Marszał reiterates that he believes the market has changed since&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>began development, and that games like the aforementioned titles aren't doing particularly well in the current climate.</p>

<p>He says that&nbsp;<em>Project 8&nbsp;</em>was suffering from a number of issues both big and small, and that correcting them would have required more development time than management was comfortable with, so the game was shelved.</p>

<p>Marszał also reveals two new 11 bit studios projects, although he doesn't go into detail about either of them. The first is a 25-developer project with a smaller budget that's targeting a 2027 release, while the second will be "bigger" and take around "four years" for production.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-the-alters_0.jpg?itok=Uw2q529R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-the-alters_0.jpg?itok=AIZMvMLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of 11 bit studios' next projects will reportedly be on a similar level to the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to&nbsp;Marszał, 11 bit is also about to announce a change in its publishing strategy, which the CEO says is a "direct consequence" of its experience in this area so far.</p>

<p>To remind you, the studio doesn't just publish its own games; it's also a third-party publisher, with games like surreal adventure&nbsp;<em>Indika</em>, sci-fi head-scratcher&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/invincible" rel="nofollow"><em>The Invincible</em></a>, and CRPG&nbsp;<em>The Thaumaturge&nbsp;</em>being some of the games on its publishing slate.</p>

<p>In any case, it sounds like both of the newly-revealed 11 bit projects are still a little ways away from being ready, so it might be a while before we hear what they are. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The result is movie studios being willing to give him lavish budgets to make whatever he wants, and top talent jockeying for the limited spots in his upcoming projects. </p><p>But what could really set Nolan’s take on <em>The Odyssey</em> apart is his penchant for non-linear storytelling, with out-of-order scenes, unreliable narrators, and occasional time dilation. <em>The Odyssey</em> has all of those things, and there’s potential for the epic poem, in Nolan’s hands, to be turned into more of a “What happened to Odysseus?” puzzle box thriller than a straightforward monster-slaying saga about the journey home. It’s also full of rich metaphoric language ripe for creative license and re-interpretation. The movie is set to begin filming next year. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It definitely feels like Hollywood and TV companies have figured out video games in the last few years. No, they don’t always get it right, but between huge, blockbusting animated films for Sonic and Mario, and TV and streaming series like Castlevania, The Last of Us and the following selection of shows, we’re a world away from the bad times of Doom, Prince of Persia and Mario… the live action one.</p>

<p>The Last of Us changed gaming in 2013 with its unparalleled story telling and, a decade later, HBO’s The Last of Us rewrote the script on how to make a TV adaptation of a video game. The team behind Amazon’s Fallout TV show were clearly taking notes, as it does exactly what The Last of Us did, taking the world of the game for your setting but make sure to focus on the characters. We follow a trio of protagonists, all of which were created for the show but are based on archetypes found in the games, with their stories crossing over at various points as the mystery of a vault is gradually revealed.</p>
<p>The show also has a strong emotional centre which unexpectedly comes from Walton Goggins’s character, the Ghoul. The radioactive gunslinger is the star of the show, his tragic story from television star to reviled outcast is spread across the episodes and neatly dovetails in the story of &nbsp;Lucy, played by Yellowjackets’ Ella Purnell.&nbsp; Rounding out the trio is Aaron Moten who manages to bring to life the weakest of the three, Maximus, a squire of the Brotherhood of Steel who steals a set of Power Armour after Knight Titus exits stage left, killed by a bear.</p>
<p>Everything you love from the franchise is on screen, even down to the smallest detail like the door handles being the same as in the game, it is extraordinarily faithful to the games but is careful to keep the fan service to background details. The show doesn’t shy away from some spectacularly gory sequences which like the game are mostly played for laughs but there are some very real moments of danger, the psychotic Snip Snip, a Mr. Handy turned organ harvester is the stuff of nightmares.</p>

<p>Series 2 was confirmed by Amazon just nine days after the show premiered but with filming only just starting it’s going to be a while before we settle down with a Nuka Cola and enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Arcane: League of Legends – Runner-up</h2>
<p>The two series of Arcane on Amazon’s Prime video service cost more than a live action Marvel movie and for once it actually shows – every single shot in the series could be framed and hung in an art gallery. The first series was slightly laboured and took a while to set up things up, but that’s allowed series two to race ahead, barely taking time for breath as it throws in multiple plot lines with witches, bio tech experiments and an awful lot of trippy dream sequences.</p>
<p>Clearly influenced by the Spiderverse movies, the show changes art style to emphasise character moments, switching in an instant from lush, almost water coloured paintings to frantic neon scribbles and, just like the first season, the needle drops are perfect. If you haven’t caught up with Arcane then you really should, you don’t need to know a thing about the game, and it’s genuinely good.</p>
<h2>Secret Level – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Amazon nailed the video game adaptation with Fallout, but Secret Level had more mixed reviews. That’s almost purely because there are so many different games and styles covered.</p>
<p>Some of the episodes stick slavishly to the lore of the games and wider universes, notable the Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K stories, but I personally found the more obtuse reimaginings to be the highlights.&nbsp; Two really stood out for me, the Pac-Man episode takes the little gold disc and turns them in to evil AI who encourages a humanoid clone to kill and eat everything in his way, and with shots of the clone devouring gore and intestines so they can grown bigger and stronger for the body horror finale.</p>
<p>In a complete change of pace, the PlayStation episode is an family friendly original story which just happens to feature a few characters from famous Sony franchises. The Helldivers are a hoot, speaking just like they do in the game: “What is that?”, “I don’t know…. SHOOT IT!”</p>

If you paid more, you got PC and streaming games, too.</p><p>But in the summer, Xbox announced a big price hike for all Xbox plans. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the plan that included everything, went from $17 to $20. Meanwhile, the console-only plan, which previously cost $11 a month, was being retired and replaced with a new “Game Pass Standard” tier that cost $15 a month and would no longer include day-one releases. Xbox explained that eventually some day-one releases would land on Standard, but didn’t specify a timetable. </p><p>To sum it up: Everyone is paying more for Game Pass, but not everyone gets access to big new games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> at launch. Not great! For as long as Game Pass has been a thing, the promise of day-one first-party titles like <em>Halo </em>has been its big selling point.

It can’t seem to support all of these studios, however, and keeps closing them or laying people off. </p><p>Game Pass is now a questionable and expensive subscription plan that is a very shitty version of what we used to have, and which is only likely to get worse as Microsoft looks to keep numbers growing amid a lack of new users. </p><p>And if you’re looking to buy a new console, it almost seems like a gamble at this point to invest in an Xbox Series X/S. I’m not suggesting Microsoft will flip a switch and kill its consoles overnight. But as the company invests more and more into streaming and makes more of its exclusives multiplatform, there are fewer and fewer reasons to own an Xbox, whatever that even means in 2024.</p><p>2025 could also be a massive year for Xbox. It has new games coming from Bethesda, Activision, and its own many studios in the next few months, and will likely announce more as the year goes on. But 2024 was also a big year for Xbox; it’s just that the cost was massive job cuts, big price increases, and multiple studio closures. So while some Xbox fans might be excited for another big year, I’m truly concerned about how much more blood will be spilled to pay for it. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-0-16-0-0-patch-notes-full-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s wipe is here and it’s coming hand-in-hand with the 0.16.0.0 update. Amongst other things, this patch introduces a Custom rework, winter weather, new quests, and several new weapons. It’s also ushering in the global reset that typically brings hundreds of thousands of players back to the game every six months or so.</p>



<p>Read below to check out the most important aspects of the 0.16.0.0 patch notes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-0-16-0-0-notes-key-changes">Tarkov 0.16.0.0 Notes – Key Changes</h2>



<p>The winter season is in full force in the 0.16.0.0 patch, with winter weather being brought back into the game. It’s a little more granular than last year’s snowy update, though, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Khorovod, a new winter-themed event</li>



<li>‘Frostbite’, a new status effect that reduces players’ visibility and stamina. The effect goes away in shelters, near burning barrels, or when drinking alcohol</li>



<li>Updated the winter environment visual effects;</li>



<li>Added snowdrifts in various areas for more variety;</li>



<li>Added a winter theme Factory, including snow and matching elements;</li>



<li>Added a unique winter sound design for all locations</li>
</ul>



<p>At the heart of the update sits an overhaul for Customs, one of the most popular maps in Escape from Tarkov. In the 0.16.0.0 patch notes, it was confirmed that Battlestate Games has:</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated the old textures and materials on the location, and replaced the old objects with more up-to-date ones;</li>



<li>Fully updated some of the buildings on the location;</li>



<li>Replaced all opaque glass blocks on the location with transparent ones;</li>



<li>Opened three buildings on the industrial territory;</li>



<li>Added new objects to the location, including exploding propane cylinders;</li>



<li>Added new points of interest;</li>



<li>Added a transit to Shoreline;</li>



<li>Added new exfils</li>
</ul>



<p>When players reach level 55 in Escape from Tarkov’s PvP mode (and complete many other prerequisites), they’ll now be able to enter ‘Prestige’ mode. This is present in Tarkov Arena, also. For the full details on Tarkov’s Prestige mode, check out <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/323?lang=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the breakdown provided by Battlestate Games</a>.</p>



<p>Here are all the new weapons coming to Tarkov in 0.16.0.0:</p>



<ul>
<li>RShG-2 72.5mm rocket launcher;</li>



<li>Sako TRG M10 .338 LM bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Aklys Defense Velociraptor .300 Blackout assault rifle;</li>



<li>Saiga-12K 12ga automatic shotgun;</li>



<li>FN SCAR-H X-17 7.62×51 assault rifle;</li>



<li>Akula push dagger;</li>



<li>V40 Mini-Grenade</li>
</ul>



<p>On the topic of weapons, Battlestate Games has also overhauled how visual recoil works in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added random weapon sway and horizontal rotation;</li>



<li>Implemented the visual effect of the bolt hitting the receiver;</li>



<li>Added a camera shake effect, reflecting the buttstock hitting the shoulder;</li>



<li>Added slight barrel sway effect for pistols;</li>



<li>Shotguns now have the inertia and calibre power effect;</li>



<li>Updated the 3rd person aiming animations</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of all that, BSG has added further customisation options for the Hideout, balanced countless weapons and items, and tweaked how AI enemies work. For instance, Partisan, Raiders, Rogues, and other bots can now use UBGLs, and they’ll start flanking, suppressing, and becoming more aggressive in fights.</p>



<p>And of course, hundreds of bug fixes and quality-of-life changes have been applied, such as increasing the ruble stack limit from 500,000 to one million.</p>

<p>Every six months or so, Escape from Tarkov undergoes a ‘wipe’, a global reset that level the playing field for everyone on the platform. It’s also the time when Tarkov becomes more popular than ever, with hundreds of thousands of players flooding the game to get their early wipe tasks completed all over again.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m walking you through the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips that you can use to get ahead of the competition at the start of the wipe. If you’re a new Tarkov player looking for the best tricks and tips possible, look no further than this guide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-tarkov-starter-tips-for-a-new-wipe">Best Tarkov Starter Tips for a New Wipe</h2>



<p>Whether you’re a first-time Tarkov player or a veteran in need of a refresh, here are the best Tarkov tips you can use to get a foothold in the wipe as early as possible.</p>



<h3 id="h-run-your-gear">Run Your Gear</h3>



<p>When the wipe hits, don’t be afraid to run those T4 rigs and vests – everyone else will be relying on their PACA vests (if they’re USEC) because they don’t want to risk losing the good stuff, so you’ll be going in with an advantage. If you do lose your T4 vest, you’ll just have to work harder to make it back, soldier.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you open a cache or a box and find a T5 – or by some miracle, a T6 – then don’t be afraid to run that, either. It’ll make you hugely more resilient than the rest of the players running around.</p>



<h3 id="h-understand-the-mechanics">Understand the Mechanics</h3>



<p>In recent years, Escape from Tarkov has undergone several major changes that have brought about new mechanics. For instance, in 0.12.12.0, ‘inertia’ was added, giving players more weight and making them slower. These days, players are utilising movement mechanics like mantling and vaulting, and in the latest update, 0.16.0.0, new recoil-based changes have been implemented.</p>



<p>From new ways to use hotkeys to bipods that can drastically improve your accuracy at long range, Tarkov has had several new mechanics hit the platform in the last few updates. If you’re coming in from a hiatus, you might be left confused by some of them, so take the time to understand what has changed.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player, make sure you devote time to understanding how some core elements of Tarkov work:</p>



<ul>
<li>Healing</li>



<li>Inventory management</li>



<li>Insurance</li>



<li>Weapons and ammunition</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-shopping-list">Shopping List</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let the quiet streets fool you; danger is everywhere in Escape from Tarkov</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is a looter-shooter for some, with many players darting around the map eager to secure the most high-value items. There are many things that you’ll want to start collecting early on to help bolster those early-game tasks, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salewa medkits</li>



<li>Morphine injectors</li>



<li>Gas analysers</li>



<li>Flash drives</li>



<li>Module 3M body armor</li>



<li>TOZ-106 shotgun</li>



<li>Small ‘Tushonka’</li>



<li>Toolsets</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, there are several items you’ll want to keep an eye open for as you traverse the many maps of Tarkov. They’ll be hugely helpful in getting the earliest parts of your Hideout constructed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Leatherman Multitool</li>



<li>M-Tape</li>



<li>Car battery</li>



<li>Awl</li>



<li>Lightbulbs</li>



<li>Corrugated hose</li>



<li>Screws</li>



<li>Nails</li>



<li>Medical tools</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth using a resource <a href="https://tarkov.dev/maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Tarkov Dev</a> to learn the maps and to pinpoint where these items spawn.</p>



<h3 id="h-prioritise">Prioritise</h3>



<p>Prioritisation is key in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Should you run towards the gunfire and potentially scoop some kills, or live to fight another day by running in the opposite direction? Should you take that loot and risk being heavy as hell, or leave it and hope to find some lighter goodies?</p>



<p>At the start of the wipe, you don’t want to loot <strong>everything</strong>. Use a resource <a href="https://tarkov-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Tarkov Market</a> to identify what’s selling and what’s worth the most to help with inventory management. If you have the opportunity, you should always be extracting with every slot filled, but you won’t always have the luxury of leaving with a full backpack.</p>



<p>This new Tarkov wipe guide is centred around prioritisation when you think about it:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prioritise high-value, necessary loot such as quest items and Hideout components</li>



<li>Prioritise quest completion over gunfights</li>



<li>Prioritise your route before loading onto a map</li>



<li>Prioritise one-time quests over daily or weekly tasks</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-get-busy-tasking">Get Busy Tasking</h3>



<p>One of the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips is to start grinding tasks as early as possible. By doing this, you’ll get a leg up on your opponents and start earning massive chunks of XP. Within a few raids, you’ll have the Flea Market unlocked – which is massively important and a key part of this early wipe start guide.</p>



<p>To that end, you’ll be heading to Ground Zero, the newest Tarkov map, to complete five tasks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Burning Rubber</li>



<li>First in Line</li>



<li>Shooting Cans</li>



<li>Saving the Mole</li>



<li>Luxurious Life (unlocks after some pre-requisites)</li>
</ul>



<p>Ground Zero is effectively a starter map, and it offers a small-form, rapid introduction to Escape from Tarkov. If you’re a new Tarkov player, it’s where you’ll get your first taste of combat and exploration.</p>



<p>If you’re sneaky or talented, you can get these tasks completed in one raid. It’ll mean you’ll leave your first Tarkov raid with thousands of XP points, and you’ll go on to unlock some great early-wipe gains. It’ll be a nice confidence booster for the road ahead, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-build-up">Build Up</h3>



<p>The Hideout is hugely important in Escape from Tarkov. It offers many benefits, such as item crafting, skill growth, and boosts that you’ll come to rely on later in the game. It’s a good idea and one of the best Tarkov tips to get started building your Hideout as soon as possible.</p>



<p>The shopping list I’ve detailed above gives you some idea of where to start, but you’ll need <strong>a lot </strong>of resources to make the most of your Hideout. Keep an eye open for the things you need to get the biggest boosts and benefits from your Hideout as you play.</p>



<p>Some of the key constructs you’ll want to focus on in the Tarkov Hideout are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Workbench (weapon customisation)</li>



<li>Medstation (health regen and med crafting)</li>



<li>Intelligence Center (money gain boost)</li>



<li>Library (experience gain boost)</li>
</ul>



<p>Before you get to some of these, you’ll need to work on everything from power to security, and from lighting to home comforts like a rest area and food production systems. By the end of a Tarkov wipe, you’ll have a Hideout that’s worthy of the most accomplished PMC.</p>



<h3 id="h-stash-management">Stash Management</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Will a nice weapon stay in your stash or be taken out on raids?</figcaption></figure>







<p>In Escape from Tarkov, successful stash management is key to your financial success, especially if you’re a standard user with the default stash size. This is where you’ll keep the spoils of your raids, along with weapons, ammunition, healing items, food, and everything else you find or craft in Tarkov.</p>



<p>Here’s a solid new wipe Tarkov tip: Buy the Lucky Scav Junkbox as soon as possible. Once you’ve got the 1.1 million rubles needed, acquire the box to stash a stunning amount of quest, Hideout, and miscellaneous items that you’ll bring back from your raids. It’ll stop your stash from getting overwhelmed in the first days after the wipe.</p>



<p>Remember to also:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Backpack stack’, putting backpacks inside of each other to increase storage space</li>



<li>Strip guns, removing their magazines and grips to make them only one line deep. If it’s a cheap weapon, you can scrap or sell the magazines, putting on new ones later for just a few rubles</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-make-gains">Make Gains</h3>



<p>When you start playing after a wipe, one of the best Tarkov tips is to sell everything you don’t need very early on. This will reward you with plenty of easy cash right off the bat.</p>



<p>For instance, the Edge of Darkness and The Unheard Edition pre-order bonuses include a lot that you might not want or need, such as baseball caps, one-use healing items, alcohol, certain weapons, cheap attachments, and some crafting components. If you don’t think you’ll need them, you’re probably right, and once you start getting better stuff in the wild, there’s no point hanging on.</p>



<p>For instance, if you find one ‘CALOK’ hemostatic dressing, you’ll use that over a CAT or an Esmarch tourniquet as it has three uses before it’s gone. That’s the same for an AI-2 medkit, which will quickly be replaced by IFAK, AFAK, Salewa, and Grizzly medkits.</p>



<p>If you find a Grizzly, you’ll be soaring – that can heal heavy bleeds, light bleeds, injured limbs, concussions, and broken bones.</p>



<h3 id="h-running-guns">Running Guns</h3>



<p>The best early-game guns in Escape from Tarkov can be the difference between winning and losing a fight. Early on, the starting weapons after a wipe will be everywhere, and you’ll typically see people using:</p>



<ul>
<li>SKS</li>



<li>AKS-74U</li>



<li>M4A1</li>



<li>Mosin</li>
</ul>



<p>They’re cheap, easy to maintain, and the ammunition for them will be everywhere at the start of wipe, on account of many other people using them. As I mentioned above, you shouldn’t be afraid to run better equipment than everyone else – it’ll give you an edge in the early days.</p>



<p>Also, make sure you’re using the right weapons for each Tarkov map. If you’re going onto Woods, you’ll want a rifle, a marksman rifle, or a sniper rifle. If you’re running through Customs or Factory, you’ll be better off with a high-ergo assault rifle or an SMG. </p>



<p>When it comes to loading into a raid, make sure you’re insuring your gear with <strong>Prapor </strong>rather than <strong>Therapist</strong>, but don’t feel the need to waste money insuring very low-level equipment.</p>



<h3 id="h-preparation-is-everything">Preparation is Everything</h3>



<p>If you’re new to Tarkov and you’re looking for the best tips for your first wipe, you’ll ideally want to have a second monitor – or a tablet, or something similar. Having a second screen is huge in Escape from Tarkov, as it lets you have maps, market screens, and quest guides to help you out.</p>



<p>Tarkov is <strong>not </strong>an easy game, and it’s designed to be unwelcoming and a little awkward at times. That’s why it’s a good idea to use a second screen when you play.</p>



<p>Here are the best sites to use when playing Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://tarkov.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov.dev</a> (maps, item guides, profit trackers, loot tiers)</li>



<li><a href="https://tarkov-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Market</a> (Flea Market tracker)</li>



<li><a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wiki Ballistics</a> (Ammo stats)</li>



<li><a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Quests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wiki Quests</a> (quest guides)</li>



<li><a href="https://mapgenie.io/tarkov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Map Genie</a> (interactive maps)</li>



<li><a href="https://tarkov-changes.com/changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Changes</a> (patch notes)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re <strong>brand new </strong>in Tarkov, it’s a good idea to either invest in PvE access or play ‘offline’ games against bots. This will allow you to learn the maps. Don’t make a habit of playing against bots, though. You’ll gain nothing but a little game knowledge – combat experience is everything and you’ll only get that against real players.</p>



<h3 id="h-buddy-up">Buddy Up</h3>



<p>It’s a good idea to play Escape from Tarkov with other people. Having that extra set of eyes and ears – and an extra gun – can be pivotal to your success in the game. Plus, there will be people to cover you when you complete certain tasks, and they’ll be able to ‘hide your gear’ when you die and they stay alive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, plenty of Tarkov groups exist on social media platforms, and there are many Discord servers live that offer buddy-up opportunities. Most of the biggest Tarkov streamers have Discord servers that you can lean on to find Tarkov players to play with.</p>



<p>If you want to find Tarkov players to run with, try some of these servers:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/2gCdVEJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Landmark</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Pestily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pestily</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/glorious-e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glorious_e</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/redSVXhFMm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gingy</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/5HZP9Mv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WillerZ</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-run-your-scavs">Run Your Scavs</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Scavs have bad weapons and almost no equipment, but they’re still valuable</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is a divisive Tarkov starter tip as not many people agree with it, but it’s a solid recommendation to run your Scav character. In Escape from Tarkov, you can play as a temporary ‘Scav’ or your persistent PMC character. Playing as a Scav will see you assigned a one-shot build that you can take on any map – except Labs.</p>



<p>When you play as a Scav, you can’t complete tasks and your PMC character won’t grow, but it’s a fantastic opportunity to seek out task items and equipment without worrying about losing your equipment or incurring a loss on your PMC character.</p>



<p>If you’re on a PMC losing streak, consider running a Scav to change the pacing a bit. Scavs spawn later in the raid, so the bulk of the action should have passed and only a few PMCs will be running around, giving you the opportunity to scoop up leftover loot and the remnants of fights.</p>



<h3 id="h-quick-settings">Quick Settings</h3>



<p>Here are some quick settings changes you should make when you start playing Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Autohide’ Quick Slots to increase visibility</li>



<li>‘Always Shown’ Stamina and Stance icons</li>



<li>‘Always Shown’ Health Condition</li>



<li>‘Polychrome’ Health Color Scheme, making it easier to see what’s injured</li>



<li>‘Head Bobbing’ set to 0.2, as low as possible</li>



<li>‘FOV’ should be between 66 – 70</li>



<li>‘Malfunction Notifications’ On</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s the full breakdown of the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips. I hope this helps you get started in your first wipe – or your first wipe <strong>back</strong>. Have fun out there!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>2024 didn’t live up to the heights of 2023, but it certainly produced bangers. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is most definitely in the “banger” category. While I can understand the titles superseding it in 2024, in some ways, Rebirth ended up being a “failure.”</p>



<p>I’ll preface by saying Final Fantasy 7 was one of my childhood games. I played it several times, adored the combat, and grew very attached to the characters. The remake trilogy is at the forefront of my wishes, so there’s an inherent bias between myself and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. </p>



<p>However, this doesn’t mean I can’t be objective here, and I recognize why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-new-dlc-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> won Game of the Year (It was my pick too!) For all the effort and time that went into FF7 Rebirth though, the post-launch rewards didn’t justify the final product.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-the-perfect-rpg">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is The Perfect RPG</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’m as peeved as you, Cloud. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 92 rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, a 99% Critics Recommend score on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15136/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenCritic</a>, and seven nominations at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> should feel like a big W for Could Strife and his crew. Yet, I’m sitting here, and it feels like no one is talking about an all-time JRPG great.</p>



<p>Rebirth has coherent storytelling with epic twists and turns, a deep and intuitive combat system, a gorgeous palette of extensive biomes, and Red XIII walking upright in a side-splittingly comical fashion spectacularly paying homage to the original.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth may have collapsed under the weight of expectation. I would argue this installment is the most important of the three and covers one of the most talked-about segments in video game history. I’d say Rebirth handled it brilliantly and hits all the right notes: The Gold Saucer, Barret’s story in Mt. Corel, and the introduction of fate into the core narrative.</p>



<p>When it comes to Game of the Year and Best RPG of the Year, Rebirth feels like it’s been forgotten about in favor of another. </p>



<h2 id="h-rebirth-or-refantazio">Rebirth or ReFantazio?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-metaphor-refantazio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is published by Atlus—developers of the legendary Persona franchise—and their trademark influences are all over Metaphor. Atlus’ newest project received similar reviews and praise to Rebirth but is deemed a superior game in almost every way. Furthermore, it swiped three Game Awards—including “<strong>Best RPG” ahead of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ve invested over 100 hours in FF7 Rebirth and seen most of its content, and honestly believe Astro Bot is the only contender that pipped it as the year’s best content—each to their own of course. Shadow of the Erdtree is DLC, I won’t hear anything else; whereas Metaphor: ReFantazio is an exceptional JRPG, and its stylistic choices are down to personal choice, but many agree with its idiosyncrasies.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s lack of praise and love can’t be down to the perception of JRPGs, as Metaphor falls under this category too. No Metaphor: ReFantazio means more awards and praise for Rebirth. But it doesn’t change the fact Square Enix also perceives its own game as a disappointment in some ways. The company believes Rebirth did not meet sales expectations, and I’m hoping this doesn’t impact the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-final-fantasy-7-remake-already-under-way-uematsu-possibly-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>.</p>



<p>Was Rebirth released at the wrong time of year? Did the feel of a fresh IP in Metaphor: ReFantazio supersede a franchise where people know what they’re getting? I’ll be left twiddling my thumbs and asking these questions until part three hits the shelves. Big congratulations to Metaphor of course, but I’d keep a watchful eye out for a long silver-haired assailant with a long sword.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth deserve more recognition in 2024? Or was it simply bested by a better RPG and needed to do more to sell more copies? I’m keen to hear what you have to say.</p>

		<p>Welcome once again to the annual TheSixthAxis Alternative Game of the Year Awards, in which we recognise some of the more obscure achievements of gaming in 2024. Join us as we look back at a year that was, with more remasters and remakes than you can shake a stick at – how long before we get some remasters of remakes? – companies deciding to burn their business model to the ground, and our yearly hunt for the most ridiculous video game title.</p>
<h3>Most Obvious Backtrack Award</h3>
<p>It might have looked like Microsoft were building a games industry Death Star with last year’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but unlike the fantasy of Star Wars’ evil Empire, Xbox now has to face up to reality. They’ve spent an awful lot of money building this thing, but now they want to make that back, and PlayStation has been absolutely thrashing them in terms of console sales. So, after years of saying this was all about Xbox exclusives, they’ve started releasing those games on the “rival” platform.</p>
<p>But wait, it’s only going to be for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/"> small indie games and absolutely not Indy games</a>, said Phil Spencer. Fast forward six months and Microsoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">cheerfully announce</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s opened the floodgates and now Doom: The Dark Ages, The Outer Worlds 2 and more are coming to PS5. We’re still waiting for Starfield and Hellblade 2 to be announced, but there’s apparently no “red lines” for what will come to PlayStation in future.</p>

<h2>Most Persistent Refusal To Announce Something Obvious</h2>
<p>This was a pretty close run thing this year, a two horse race between Sony and Nintendo, but with the reveal and release of the PlayStation 5 Pro, there can only be one winner here. Nintendo… why won’t you just announce the Nintendo Switch 2 already?</p>
<p>You basically have already, with every single Nintendo Direct since the middle of the year also coming with a disclaimer that there definitely wouldn’t be a new console announcement.</p>
<h3><span><span>The</span> <span>Why</span> <span>Didn’t</span> <span>It</span> <span>Do</span> <span>That</span> <span><span>i</span>n</span> <span><span>t</span>he</span> <span>First</span> <span>Place</span> <span>Award</span></span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-portal/">PlayStation Portal</a> was released at the start of this year to a collective “meh”. Sure, it’s a nice device, but you had to stream games from your own PS5, even if you have Sony’s PlayStation Plus streaming subscription – not so useful if you want to game while on holiday and have not-so-great internet.</p>
<p>In November this year Sony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">announced an update</a> and at last you can stream over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalogue, but for some reason not older PlayStation games. Your guess is as good as ours…</p>

<h3>Best Xbox Game on PlayStation</h3>
<p>Yep, we’re doing this one to death this year because even two years ago this would be unthinkable. Rare’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has been selling by the bucketload on the PlayStation Store and is a very welcome addition to the family. Yo ho ho!</p>
<h2>Best Video Game Delay</h2>
<p>Delays are a pretty much inevitable part of video game development, but only Devolver Digital would be so bold as to weaponise them as part of the marketing plan, making an annual “awards” show as they bump a bunch of games back to next year.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The 15th Annual Devolver Delayed Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OR366e-oKY4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Most Pointless PS4 Remaster</h3>
<p>The Last of Us Part 2 had already been enhanced with a free update to run on PS5 and looked great, it really didn’t need a remaster, even if it did throw in a roguelike mode and some documentary stuff.</p>

<h2>Most Ridiculous Video Game Title</h2>
<p>While there’s occasionally some Western developers challenging for this category, this almost always comes down to Japense devs who are happy to make up words, shove colons in places they shouldn’t go, leave the caps lock on and throw around square brackets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/24/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles-review/">Under Night In-Birth II [Sys:Celes]</a> is pretty strong in all those counts, and then there’s Yeah! You Want “Those Games,” Right? So Here You Go! Now, Let’s See You Clear Them! 2, but we’re going to ding those for being sequels. No, you need a bit of originality round here, so we’re going with a deckbuilder roguelite spin-off to Love Live! Sunshine with『Yohane the Parhelion – NUMAZU in the MIRAGE -』.</p>
<p>Congrats, BeXide Inc., on the exquisite use of corner brackets, hyphens and capitalisation.</p>

<h3><span><span>The</span> <span>Most</span> <span>Surprising</span> <span>Thing</span> <span>That</span> <span>Is</span> <span><span>a</span>n</span> <span>Xbox</span> <span>Award</span></span></h3>
<p>Talking of Microsoft’s change of direction it’s become very clear that if you can play games on it, Microsoft want it to be an Xbox. Your TV’s an Xbox, your PC, your phone, your PlayStation, and probably even your smart fridge or toaster, which can probably play that popular Microsoft game Doom.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Xbox - This Is an Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Microsoft are completely focused on Game Pass and streaming from now on, it seems, so Xbox is no longer about the console under your TV. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed Xbox spends over $1 billion a year on third-party content for Xbox Game Pass and the service itself is profitable. However, the service has 34 million subscribers as of February this year and MS are targeting 100 million by 2030 which seems.. a lot. Will the gamble work? Only time – and the ability to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/04/skyrim-now-available-on-toilets/">Skyrim via Game Pass on your Smart Toilet</a> – will tell.</p>
<h3>The Saddest Use of $200 Million Award</h3>
<p>We have Overwatch, Destiny 2, Fortnite, and COD: Warzone, if you are going to enter the hero shooter arena you had better have something special up your sleeves and more importantly, make it free to play. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Concord, a generic slightly cartoony looking shooter than you have <em>*gasp*</em> pay money for!</p>
<p>The game was dead in the water before it even launched as your Average Joe took one look at and thought “Well yeah, but The Rivals and Splitgate and Overwatch are all free, I’m not paying for that”. The Concord team did have a plan, with weekly episodes telling a story to keep players interested but that only works if you players in the first place, and I don’t know where that $200 million went but it certainly was not on marketing. this game needed to by hyped to the heavens and beyond to have a fighting chance when it launched and it just.. arrived.</p>

<p>The horrible thing is Concord was actually quite good, we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">8/10 </a>and the recent episode of Amazon’s Secret Level based on the game was a lot of fun, it gave us a tantalising peek at the characters and how they would interact in the weekly episodes they had planned.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> was a critical hit when it launched right at the start of the year, and a modestly successful game, even if Ubisoft chose not to put it on Steam more than half a year later. A good jumping off point for a sequel, then? And especially when Ubisoft has partnered with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/12/dead-cells-co-devs-reveal-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-roguelike-alpha-sign-ups-now-live-with-early-access-in-may/">Dead Cells co-devs Evil Empire for The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>But no, Ubisoft’s bean counters apparently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team/">didn’t want a sequel because it might “cannibalize” long term sales</a> of The Lost Crown.</p>
<p>Those same money-men probably thought that Assassin’s Creed 2 was a terrible idea, and aghast at what has become of Far Cry in the past 15 years. Strangely they’d be pro-Rainbow Six (completely misunderstanding the title), and Star Wars being re-branded as Episode IV. Can’t cannibalise an original’s sales if you start off with a sequel, can you?</p>
<h3>Most Improved Awards Ceremony</h3>
<p>After ten years, and somehow by making it 50% longer than last year, Geoff Keighley actually got The Game Awards right. It was well paced with musical breaks that were actually interesting, it had a sense of humour with Statler and Waldorf seemingly reading my tweets from last years show (“It’s more like the Game Adverts with some awards”), and this time Geoff actually read the room.</p>
<p>The Game Changer Award went Amir Satvat for setting up a community to help those affected by the mass layoffs and it was genuinely touching and a brought a tear to the eye. You can check it out below, and just watch when he takes to the stage and all the developers at the back immediately give him a standing ovation and the suits at the front look very uncomfortable and eventually join in.</p>

<p>It’s a tie this year, we couldn’t decide between the “managed democracy” of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> or the clearly massively xenophobic totalitarian regime of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. But don’t decide for yourselves, that would be undemocratic, just do as you are told by your leader, he’s there for you, he has your best interests in mind, do not question anything, do not look for facts, facts are lies. All hail the glorious leader!</p>

<h3>The Half-Life 3 Award</h3>
<p>This year is the first year I can remember since I started doing this back in 2012 in which two thousand “tipsters” on Twitter have not claimed that Half Life 3 is on the way. It will probably turn up next year.</p>

			<p>One of the new features introduced in Unreal Engine 5.5, MegaLights, promises to be a game changer in terms of both performance and image quality over Lumen, as highlighted by a new tech demo now available online.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube this week by MxBenchmarkPC, which can be watched below, compares <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/836ed2f8-e2d6-49be-98d3-59d104bd351e">Quixel's Unreal Engine 5.5 Dark Ruins tech demo</a> running with software Lumen, hardware Lumen only, and hardware Lumen with MegaLights, highlighting how the new tech introduced in the latest version of the game engine by Epic not only brings a considerable performance improvement of up to 50% but also improves image quality at 4K, 1440p and 1080p resolutions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.5 MegaLights Demo - Massive Up to 50% Performance Boost and Better Image Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXnhKix16UQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/">MegaLights</a>, an experimental new feature dubbed the Nanite of lights, which enables developers to add hundreds of dynamic shadow-casting lights without constraints, isn't the only thing that Unreal Engine 5.5 brings. The latest version of the engine brings significant improvements to Sequencer, the engine's nonlinear animation editor, MetaHuman Animator, which now allows developers to generate high-quality facial animations just from audio performances, a Mutable character customization system that can be used to generate dynamic skeletal meshes, materials, and textures for characters, animals, props, weapons, and more with optimized memory usage that keeps shader cost low and more. More information on all the new features and improvements featured in the new version of the engine can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

<p>We like having banger after banger after banger. Unfortunately, things don’t always work out this way, which is why we’ve had the difficult decision to pick our top six most disappointing games of 2024—stay tuned for supreme heartbreak.</p>



<p>It’s easy to talk about the best games of 2024, but many like to leave it there. No, we need to talk about these things and remind you it’s not all roses. 2024 has had stinkers too, and I’d rather forget about the outright worst games, and fixate on the releases people were excited about, but it left them down in the dumps.</p>



<p>Like a bed-ridden Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, here’s our carefully selected assortment of most disappointing games in 2024 that didn’t deliver.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-disappointing-games-of-2024">Most Disappointing Games of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-concord">Concord</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What else is left to say? Credit to Firewalk Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel Concord’s significance will still echo a decade or two from now. When I first played the Concord beta, I genuinely thought to myself, “This is pretty solid, but nothing special.” I reiterated these comments to my peers, and I didn’t think Concord would last long, but I didn’t think I would be as right as I was. </p>



<p>Concord’s core gunplay mechanics are solid, but it didn’t do anything special that Overwatch, Valorant, or the now-released Marvel Rivals doesn’t already do. Its content was lacking—as most free-to-play, live-service titles seem to be on release—and the minimal interest in the beta was telling. People didn’t ask for Concord, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nobody-wishlist-concord-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nobody wishlisted it</a>, and their reluctance to invest time and money is why I now refer to Concord in the past tense—it’s dead.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation shut Concord down</a> within two weeks of its launch. Its reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$400 million budget</a> makes the shooter a catastrophic failure and one of the worst ever, and developers are likely to learn a lot from Concord’s mistakes for years to come.</p>



<h3 id="h-skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Trust me, this is a rare moment of exhilaration. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>I put around 20 hours into Skull and Bones, and the moments of genuine enjoyment were fleeting at best. Skull and Bones was first announced in 2017 to much hype and excitement, with players ready for a full-blown, pillaging, and pirating adventure akin to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Instead, Ubisoft ended up making a much more boring version of its own game.</p>



<p>You can’t fight other crews as the action is relegated to cutscenes, harvesting resources can be done from your ship via a simplistic mini-game, and everything about Skull and Bones is uninspired: The story, the gameplay, the lackluster visuals, and the progression. The ill-conceived fast travel system forces you to regularly travel enormous distances on your ship—where very little happens.</p>



<p>Skull and Bones had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than one million players at launch</a> and shows no signs of improving. It started a familiar trend of disappointing AAA games—or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-aaaaa-games-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAAA in Skull and Bones’ case</a>—with many games underperforming—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beauty with no brains. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, look, another Ubisoft game. The festering stink of a Ubisoft open-world lingers all over Star Wars: Outlaws. It looks pretty on the outside, but inside, a hollow, familiar journey awaits. It makes The Force Awakens’ derivative clone of A New Hope look faultless—I do love The Force Awakens, by the way, but still.</p>



<p>Outlaws promises a new story in which we get to be bandits. It’s a novel idea and a welcome one, but throughout Outlaws’ development, trailers, and gameplay reveals, it was hard to shake the feeling we were getting a reskinned Far Cry and Assassin’s Creed entry. Again, by nature, it’s a “good” game, but not one likely to live long in the memory.</p>



<p>Worse still, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=outlaws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lukewarm launch caused Ubisoft’s stock to plummet</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales underperformed</a> big time. Ultimately, it pales in comparison to EA’s Star Wars Jedi series and shows you need more than an IP to become a true Jedi.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</h3>



<figure><figcaption>This hurts my Thunderjaw. Credit to Guerrilla Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO video game franchise has sold millions of copies rehashing a successful formula. Take a popular film series or game, LEGO-ify it, turn it into a collect-a-thon with amusing cutscenes and basic gameplay, and it sells like hotcakes. LEGO’s Horizon Tallneck model is excellent, and little did we know this would prompt a crossover (like Concord) no one was asking for.</p>



<p>On paper, LEGO Horizon Adventures should be a success. I don’t think Horizon gets the praise or adulation it deserves, Aloy is a great hero to follow, and its world is captivating. But when it got the LEGO-ify treatment, people didn’t gravitate toward it. Its OpenCritic rating stands at a decent 71/100—with its “Critics Recommend” score plummeting to a lowly 53%.</p>



<p>This might be a lesson to not stick “LEGO” in front of a franchise and expect gold studs to spew out.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection">Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Lazy. Credit to Aspyr</figcaption></figure>



<p>I lost so many hours to Galactic Conquest and Hero Assault in Battlefront II, and when I heard it was getting newer and, hopefully, more polished ports, I was excited to revisit it in 2024—especially after 2017’s dismal reboot disaster. I was all ready to splash out the cash on the Classic Collection, only to study the vehement backlash to its release.</p>



<p>Currently, the Classic Collection has a “Mostly Negative” verdict under its 7,000 “All Reviews” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446550/STAR_WARS_Battlefront_Classic_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Battlefront games launched with the smallest licks of paint to polish, broken servers, missing modes featured in the original, and sus AI. Curiously, despite the full-price tags, you can actually buy “STAR WARS Battlefront (Classic, 2004)” and “STAR WARS Battlefront II (Classic, 2005)” on Steam for far less than the disastrous collection.</p>



<p>The Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection has gone under the radar somewhat, but it can’t escape the grasp of our most disappointing games of 2024 list.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Justice League didn’t need to die for this. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admit it, you were getting worried I wasn’t going to include this. How I could not feature Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League—the live-service atrocity <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-pulls-suicide-squad-just-one-hour-into-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled from Early Access barely one hour into its launch</a>. Suicide Squad was supposed to be the video game adaptation somewhat based on the movies, only, we have the fascinating plot about killing each member of the Justice League due to Brainiac’s evil influences controlling them and making them evil.</p>



<p>Instead, Kill the Justice League is full of copy-and-paste missions, painfully slow XP grinds, repetitive content, and heinous narrative decisions undermining and destroying Rocksteady’s beautifully molded Arkham universe. I also can’t forgive Suicide Squad for being the last-ever credited role of the legendary Kevin Conroy as Batman—truly lamentable in its own right.</p>



<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League bombed, and is another entry on this list <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling short of expectations</a>. Furthermore, it lost Warner Bros. over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a>—resulting in many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady layoffs</a>—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 spells its end</a> within a year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-could-be-revealed-on-january-8th-alleged-first-image-of-the-dock-surfaces-online.1069311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could finally be revealed in less than two weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hl5l1u/chinese_weibo_leaker_who_leaked_the_whole_june/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hlp8zn/the_chinese_weibo_user_has_deleted_all_previous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> subreddits, Chinese Weibo leaker 荷姆荷姆嗼, who previously correctly revealed all the June Nintendo Direct announcements before the presentation aired, recently started a countdown based on the Fibonacci sequence numbers that will end on January 8th, which could be when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed. Since having been discovered, the user deleted all of their posts, changed their profile pic, and said that the countdown was for something else, but this could be an attempt to cover things up and avoid getting identified.</p>
<p>The past few days have also heated up in terms of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks with the first alleged images of the system and the dock shared by a user going by the name of <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a>, who garnered increased attention following<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/"> a report</a> from The Verge, which believed the supposed leaker had indeed access to the yet to be revealed new system from Nintendo. After sharing an image of the<a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> system itself</a>, which doesn't look exactly legit, the leaker shared a <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1872092668551176251?t=BgCKgr3jtPRxnDOHi8Zfog&amp;s=19">second image</a> showcasing the dock, which definitely looks more believable. Still, given how wild the alleged leaks are getting, we must take everything with a huge grain of salt until Nintendo finally lifts the lid on its next-gen system.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but the moment we finally see the system may not be<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/"> too far off</a>. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games&nbsp;<span>Store's Christmas 2024 gift is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>. At the time this post goes live, you have another six hours or so </span>to permanently add it to your library for free.</p>
<p>Granted, it's not the first time the game&nbsp;<span>has been offered through such a promotion. The Epic Games Store itself already&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/control-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it away for free</a> in June 2021; the following year, AT&amp;T subscribers could <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ultimate-edition-available-for-free-through-atts-streaming-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">redeem the Ultimate Edition for free</a></span>. In that light, it might be a tad underwhelming. However, for anybody who still hasn't got the chance to play the game, it's absolutely worth taking up on the freebie.</p>
<p>Released in August 2019, Control was Remedy's return to owned IPs after making Quantum Break for Microsoft. It was developed on a €30 million budget, which is relatively small for a triple-A game, and published by 505 Games. The game was highly successful for Remedy (over 4.5 million units sold), not to mention an excellent action/adventure to play, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review of the game</a> where I scored it 8 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Control features Remedy's most original setting yet, the studio's most open-ended game environment yet and great action combat that makes you feel like a badass. The game also stands out on PC as one of the finest examples of real-time ray tracing to date. It shouldn't be passed upon by any action/adventure game fans, even if it's not quite a masterpiece.</em></p>
<p>Control is part of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-qa-sam-lake-on-the-remedy-connected-universe-and-moving-toward-open-world-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which includes Alan Wake. As such, protagonist Jesse Faden has appeared in the Alan Wake 2 DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a>. She is, of course, due to reprise her role again in the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">action RPG sequel</a>, which will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-financed by Annapurna Interactive</a>. The media production company is also going to adapt the universe to the film and TV series formats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the IP will be expanded next year with the release of the cooperative multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, where players take the role of Federal Bureau of Control first responders who get sent to defend the FBC's HQ, the eerie, ever-shifting Oldest House, from any kind of paranatural threats.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has published a series of graphics on social media highlighting some of the key statistics from the last wipe, which ends today as the 0.16.0.0 patch is ushered in.</p>



<p>It reveals some of the most interesting tidbits of information about Escape from Tarkov on a global scale – and it gives us a neat representation of the number of people still playing the game late into the wipe. Recently, concerns about the game’s longevity have been raised, with numbers seemingly dropping worldwide. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games revealed some interesting factoids about the most recent wipe in Escape from Tarkov, which ends <strong>today</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>62% of players opted to represent the USEC faction this wipe</li>



<li>99,288 players maxed out their Metabolism skill, the most popular skill by far</li>



<li>876,328 players were killed by Partisan, the boss character introduced in this wipe</li>



<li>692,000 players accepted Mortar Strike, a special event quest that surfaced several weeks ago</li>



<li>188,514 players accepted ‘Dark Times’ a late-wipe task that rewarded 39,000 players with ‘Kappa’</li>
</ul>



<p>It was further confirmed that the most popular weapons in Escape from Tarkov haven’t changed in the last few months. The most popular assault rifle was the M4A1, which is a staple weapon in the scene. It was followed closely behind by the AKS-74U. </p>



<p>The Mosin was king of the ‘bolties’, while the SVDS was the top choice for those running marksman rifles. Bizarrely, the most popular armour was the PACA Soft Armor, but that’s only because <strong>everyone </strong>uses it at the start of a new wipe. </p>











<p>The next wipe, which is live today, introduces the 0.16.0.0 patch, which expands and enhances Customs, tweaks visual recoil, and adds a bunch of new weapons and other items to the game.</p>

<p>The in-game image and abilities of the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals have leaked online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by reliable leaker RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707483691245587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the Human Torch is one of the upcoming heroes Marvel Rivals developers seem to be working on. In-game images and abilities of the character have surfaced online, hinting that he might be arriving soon. The character is seen wearing his Fantastic 4 uniform, with his whole body engulfed in flames. Additionally, his hair, eyebrows, and eyes match the colour of the fire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same thread, RivalsLeaks has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871707598703272309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> the in-game abilities page for the Human Torch in Marvel Rivals. The character’s primary attack is the Fire Cluster, the secondary attack is Blazing Blast, and his Team-Up ability with Storm is called Omega Fire. Other abilities include Supernova, Plasma Body, Pyro-Prison, and Flaming Meteor. Check out what each Human Torch ability does below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Fire Cluster (Left Click): Launches a splittable fireball at the enemy</li>



<li>Omega Fire (X): This team-up ability allows Storm to consume the Human Torch’s fire tornado and add it to her hurricane. Alternatively, the Human Torch can also consume Storm’s Hurricane to create a fiery hurricane that enlarges and intensifies all the fire tornadoes found while the ability is active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Supernova (Q): The Human Torch will release a shockwave that damages enemies within a radius. During the activation of this skill, flame fields will turn into flame tornadoes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plasma Body (L-Shift) This ability allows the Human Torch to enter a state of accelerated ascent.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pyro-Prison (E): Through this ability, players can connect flame fields to create a fire wall that can burn enemies to deal damage.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Flaming Meteor (F): This ability will make the Human Torch dive to the ground and stun nearby enemies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Blazing Blast (Right Click): Players can create a flame field in a targeted area by launching a fireball through this ability.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Many of us have a game franchise that, despite liking everything we hear about it, we have never actually played any of the games. I have a few, but one notable blind spot in my gaming resume was Yakuza, or as it's called now, Like A Dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd been told by many friends that the series has something for everyone, from heavy action scenes to lighthearted goofiness, all with real emotion at the center… and yet I still never found the time. This year saw the release of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and for a while I thought it would be just another game to add to my backlog. However, thanks to a freelance opportunity, I finally found my excuse to play a Like A Dragon game for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490"></a><figcaption>Listening to Orlando's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Through the first few chapters, I was enjoying myself, but I wasn't yet seeing what others had told me about the series all these years. That changed in Chapter 4, when I approached a shaved-ice shop on the streets of Hawaii, and Substory 24: Let It Snow began.</p><p dir="ltr">Let It Snow begins with Ichiban finding a man in a plaid shirt buying shaved ice (also known as a snow cone) at a local shop. Curiously, the man asks for no toppings on his dessert, and then once he receives the treat, he throws it into the air. As the ice immediately melts--this is Hawaii, after all--the man screams in anguish and leaves distraught. Ichiban watches this happen, and other than feeling it's really strange, doesn't think much more of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Later, we find the same man being denied shaved ice at a second stand, as the proprietor had caught wind of his weird motives. Dejected, the man sits at a nearby bench, where Ichiban can sit with him and learn his story.</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out this man, whose name we learn is Orlando, is trying to fulfill his wife Ellie's dying wish: "I want to see the snow with you again." The couple, Orlando explains, have a lot of fond memories involving snow, including their honeymoon in Japan, and while he wanted to take her back, real-life responsibilities got in the way. She wants to see snow fall with her beloved one more time before she dies, which can be any time now. Ichiban agrees to help, and the two part ways for the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">So, uh, yeah…when I first saw a weird old dude throwing shaved ice into the sky, I did not think it would lead me to "super emotional story about a man trying to help his wife on her deathbed." This is exactly the kind of thing my friends have been telling me about, and I have to admit it's effective. That's the beauty of the writing at work here; just when you think you have it all figured out, Like A Dragon surprises you. And, as the Substory continued, surprise me it <em>absolutely did</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Later on in a nearby shopping center, Ichiban watches a woman lose a stroller down an escalator. Ichiban chases the stroller--the chase consisting of quick-time events to complete--until he catches it and brings it to a stop. Ichiban looks into the stroller, only to find <em>a grown man in a diaper staring back at him</em>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492"></a><figcaption>Not what you'd expect to see in a bassinet!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is Susumu Gondawara, a yakuza boss from a previous game who veteran Like A Dragon players would know to expect, but I was completely caught off guard. This hulking baby man says his stroller got away from the "nanny" he hired, and he wants Ichiban to take him back to her. However, three of Gondawara's henchmen--also, inexplicably, in nothing but diapers--accuse Ichiban of kidnapping Gondawara, and the fight is on.</p><p dir="ltr">Once they're defeated, Gondawara asks for some milk--and the only place to find it is a nearby shaved-ice truck, which uses condensed milk as a topping. One of the henchmen gets in line, only for a man in a familiar plaid shirt to force himself into the front and ask for a shaved ice with no topping.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Ichiban, Orlando, and Gondawara all speak together, and try to come up with a solution to the problem. Orlando worries they're running out of time, and Ichiban throws his shaved ice to the ground in frustration… however, the group notices that the ice didn't melt, and instead turned to a snow-like substance. How did this happen?</p><p dir="ltr">Are you ready?</p><p dir="ltr">You'll never guess…</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out that the absorbent of the diapers Gondawara and his men are wearing <em>mixed with the shaved ice</em>, and the combination created the "snow." I'd heard Like A Dragon could be wacky, but I don't think I realized just how wacky things could get. After Gondawara explains the difference between his group's "baby play" fantasy and real-world honor, the three agree to a plan.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene then shifts to the hotel where Orlando and Ellie are staying, where--and I cannot believe I'm typing these words--Ichiban, Gondawara, and the underlings mix diaper absorbent with shaved ice, then throw it off of the rooftop of the hotel. Orlando and Ellie, together in their room just below said rooftop, see the "snow" come through the window and are delighted.</p><p dir="ltr">Ellie calls Orlando a "magician," before asking for one more last wish: She wants to see Orlando smile one last time before she falls asleep. He obliges, tears welling in his eyes, and she eventually falls asleep for the final time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493"></a><figcaption>Ellie's final moments.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, to recap, in order to help a desperate man fulfill the final wish of his dying wife, our hero Ichiban:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Enlisted the help of a man who likes to act as a baby</li><li dir="ltr">Mixed absorbent from that man's adult diaper supply with shaved ice to create "snow"</li><li dir="ltr">Threw the mixture off of a roof, so the desperate man and his wife could see it fall from the room below.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite the sheer wackiness making this whole thing happen, the heart at the core of the scene cannot be denied. Ichiban stepped up to help a stranger, simply because he could, and he made a dying woman's final wish come true in the process. Once the "snow" started to fall, and the scene focused on Orlando and Ellie, I forgot about the absurdities of it all and focused on the relatable, human story at the center of the Substory, and it filled me with a warmth that most games aren't capable of creating… until the scene switches back to Ichiban and company, where Gondawara's henchmen are laying on the rooftop exhausted--and buck naked. It's a last bit of wackiness to send us off; this is Like A Dragon, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">After years of being told I would like this series, and never having time to check it out, Infinite Wealth was officially my first foray into what Like A Dragon/Yakuza has to offer. Thanks to Substory 24: Let It Snow, I've seen the light. I'm sold, and I plan to go back and see what I've been missing all this time as soon as possible--and all it took was a little "winter" magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>While 2024 may have felt light in terms of new fighting game franchises, the past year still delivered plenty of excitement for fans of the genre, especially thanks to the release of new entries in some of the most celebrated series in gaming history, such as the Tekken and Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi series. Whether you prefer going head-to-head with your opponents using your iron fists, unleashing ki blasts, pulling off perfect piledrivers, or knocking them off platforms while wavedashing toward them, 2024 offered plenty of opportunities to unleash your fighting spirit against.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a></em></p>
<h2>Tekken 8 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tekken8-key-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The wait for a new King of the Iron First tournament has been long, but the wait has been repaid in full, as Tekken 8 is a game worthy of being part of one of the best fighting games series ever. While the game does leave something to be desired when it comes to single-player content, especially compared to previous entries in the series, and the netcode doesn't always deliver a smooth experience if both players don't have a flawless internet connection, the amazing learning tools it offers and the diverse character roster, which has started expanding beyond the boundaries of the franchise with the introduction of Final Fantasy XVI's protagonist Clive Rosfield, make it one of the best fighting games of the generation for the competitive-minded players. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review:</p>
<p><em>Featuring cutting-edge visuals for fighting games and exceptional learning tools, Tekken 8 stands out as one of the best releases in the fighting game genre over the last few years. While the netcode is generally acceptable, regrettably, it falls short of replicating the seamless offline experience, a drawback that significantly affects the overall experience way more than the limited amount of single player content and somewhat diminishes the effectiveness of the game's outstanding learning tools, particularly for those unable to engage in offline multiplayer matches.</em></p>
<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WWE-2K24.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The WWE 2K series has had it rough in the past few years. After stumbling badly with WWE 2K20, the series by Visual Concept had to take one year off to find its footing again, which it somewhat did with WWE 2K22 and WWE 2K23, whose formula, while far from being the best, showed some promise. With WWE 2K24, however, the series finally made a proper comeback from its dark age, with fun new mechanics and match types and a great selection of play modes. The core action could still use some refinements, but it definitely seems like Visual Concept is on the right track to bring the series back to greatness, to the joy of all WWE fans all over the world. Here's what Nathan Birch had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24 this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">9</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series has long been left dormant, but it is still considered one of the best series based on the massively popular series created by Akira Toriyama. Topping the third main entry in the series was far from being easy to accomplish, but developer Spike Chunsoft outdid themselves with a game that not only feels great to play but also takes advantage of modern gaming technology and engines such as the Unreal Engine 5 to make players feel as if they were indeed part of the Dragon Ball universe. Sure, the game may be a little unbalanced, but it wouldn't be Dragon Ball if the power levels wouldn't range from 10 to over 2,000,000. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<h2>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">8</a>)</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MARVEL-vs.-CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-Arcade-Classics.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series took the world of fighting games by storm before it was actually called so with the release of the first tag fighter ever made by CAPCOM, X-Men vs Street Fighter, and seeing it end so ingloriously with the average Marvel VS. Capcom Infinite was truly a shame. Thankfully, it seems like the two companies are still open to working together, and released this year the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, a new collection that includes the first two main entries in the series as well as the other games made by the creator of Street Fighter featuring Marvel Comics characters like X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and the side-scrolling beat'em up The Punisher. While the collection highlighted how some of these games haven't aged as well as others have, it also highlighted how others, like MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2, are still a joy to play. Too bad for the lack of cross-platform play, especially on PC where there are more popular options to enjoy these classics. Here's what I said about the collection in my review:</p>
<p><em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em></p>
<h2>Rivals of Aether II</h2>
<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Rivals-of-Aether-2.jpg"></a></h2>
<p>With the latest entry in the Super Smash Bros. series having been released six years ago, many other platform fighters got their chance to shine, filling the void left open by the series that essentially created a whole new sub-genre. Among the few platform fighters released since, Rivals of Aether II is the one that capitalized the most on this situation, becoming the go-to game for those who cannot live their gaming life without dash dancing, wavedashing, shield dropping, and so on. Instead of attempting to do things differently, which doesn't always lead to the best results, the game developed by Aether Studios went all in on the formula made popular by Super Smash Bros. Melee, making it easier to perform some of the advanced tech listed above to allow players to focus on the fun. While on paper, this may detract from the game's identity a bit, the developer masterfully weaved together these elements with the cast's diverse moveset to provide a game that will only grow in popularity as time goes on.</p>
<p>Sadly, the lack of single-player content prevents Rivals of Aether II from being a must-buy right now for those looking for some casual fun, but hopefully, this issue will be addressed as the game expands in the future.</p>
