                <p>Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo projects</a>, but what are they and when will we learn about them? It might not be a whole lot longer until Halo's future comes into focus. Halo Studios has announced that it will share more information about what's next for Halo at the Halo World Championships event this October.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo Studios said it's observed "a fair amount of speculation about when and where more details might emerge" about the next Halo projects currently underway. "We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the developer said.</p><p>It was at last year's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including Project Foundry. This was also when Microsoft announced that 343 Industries was rebranding as Halo Studios.</p><p>"For us, A New Dawn was just the beginning--at this year's HaloWC, we look forward to continuing the conversation," the developer said. "Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The event takes place October 24-26 in Seattle.

Microsoft has made major changes since then, including installing a new executive leadership team and switching game engines, while acknowledging that Halo Infinite missed the mark in some respects. Xbox boss Matt Booty previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">Halo Infinite's launch was like a runner tripping at the finish line.</a></p><p>"Halo Infinite was the last remnant of how we made Halo games in the past.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Over the last couple of days a screenshot was taken showing an AI prompt in some background text of 11 bit Studios latest game, The Alters. The use of AI in the development of The Alters had not previously been disclosed by 11 bit Studios, including on Steam where games should be making it clear if AI has been used. Now, 11 bit Studios has released a statement, which is presented below without comment.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/965Km7t6KwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context. AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.</em></p>
<p><em>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>For transparency, we’ve included a screenshot to show how and where it appears in the game. While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience.</em></p>

<div>

<p><em>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented.</em></p>

<p><em>To give you a better understanding of what a small part of the overall scope of the game’s narrative layer they are, those few external movies are approximately 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text. The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know.</em></p>
<p><em>As AI tools evolve, they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We’re actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal.”</em></p>

<figure><a title="Disney Speedstorm Stitch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a2d48e5229ac/disney-speedstorm-stitch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gameloft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gameloft has announced that its free-to-play online racer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a>, is getting a free Switch 2 upgrade.</p>
<p>Shared via an in-game message (and reported on by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/30/disney-speedstorm-is-getting-a-nintendo-switch-2-update/">My Nintendo News</a>), the upgrade is due to arrive at the start of the new season, which lands on 3rd July.</p>
<p>Gameloft promises that the Switch 2 upgrade will mean the game will run at 6fps and will be 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked, which is a huge upgrade from the Switch 1 version. We're also getting "better shadows, anti-aliasing, and shader quality".</p>
<p>You can read the full statement below, shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneySpeedstormGame/comments/1lo1zmh/we_finally_got_an_update_on_switch_2_improvements/">DisneySpeedstormGame subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>We're definitely looking forward to seeing the improvements on the new console, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/disney-speedstorm">our biggest criticisms of the Switch 1 release</a> were the visuals and frame rate issues. The game was meant to hit 30fps, but it frequently struggled to reach that number, and it didn't look <em>great</em> in handheld either.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out what';s coming in Season 14 — alongside the Switch 2 update — in the trailer below.</p>

<p>With the Switch 2 update, hopefully this means fans will be able to enjoy the game on Nintendo's hardware.</p>

He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A summer camping trip is the perfect excuse to stop staring at screens, but it doesn’t mean you need to go completely off the grid. <strong>Jackery’s Explorer 1000 Power Station V2</strong> lets you charge your gadgets and have more fun while you’re camping. For instance, you can plug in a projector, speakers, or a space heater. In other words, it’s great for entertainment and for maintaining a certain quality of life you may not be willing to give up while camping. This charging station, which also includes a SolarSaga 200W Portable Solar Panel, costs $698.99 ($601 off), its lowest price ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Generator-Portable-Off-Grid-Emergency/dp/B0D2L1G66J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. </p><p>The Explorer 1000 v2 will typically output 1,500 watts, which is enough juice to run a mini fridge, coffee maker, and other small appliances, or recharge a smartphone dozens of times. It can handle 3,000 watt power surges if a gadget draws a lot more energy briefly. The Explorer 1000 has three AC Outlets, two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and a DC power port, and can power or charge multiple gadgets at the same time. A small screen shows its battery percentage and how much power is being drawn. You can also view that information on your smartphone using the Jackery app. </p><p>The Explorer 1000 recharges in under two hours when plugged into an outlet, but you can reduce that time to one hour by enabling its Emergency Charging setting using the Jackery app. Fast charging will sacrifice battery health, which is something to consider. Jackery says the Explorer 1000 can retain up to 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charges. </p><p>The SolarSaga Portable Solar Panel that’s included can refill the generator’s battery in about seven and a half hours with direct sunlight, and you can cut that time in half by connecting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-SolarSaga-Portable-Compatible-Generator/dp/B00GCMUUPA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">second one</a>. The panel is waterproof, and can be folded up to protect the panels from damage. The panel uses a sensor in the upper-right corner to automatically adjust its positioning to ensure the sun is hitting it at the optimal angle. </p><div><p id="four-more-deals-worth-a-look"><h2><strong>Four more deals worth a look</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Thousands of games are heavily discounted during the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F" rel="sponsored">Steam Summer Sale</a>, which is running through July 10th.

                <p>The Animaniacs was the follow-up series to Tiny Toon Adventures and introduced young audiences to the Warner Bros. characters Wakko, Yakko, and their sister, Dot. The animated program was a huge hit, spawning merchandise, a movie, and nine video games--including the two spin-off games focused on Pinky and The Brain.

            <p>
11 Bit Studios has responded to criticism surrounding its use of generative AI in sci-fi game The Alters, insisting the controversial elements discovered by players were either "temporary" assets "never intended to be part of the final release" or used in a "very limited manner."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit, which has also developed the acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>, found itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation">focus of controversy over the weekend</a> after evidence of AI-generated assets were discovered in The Alters - despite the studio failing to disclose their use on Steam, as mandated by Valve.
</p>
<p>
One image widely circulated on social media showed an in-game background display featuring a text-based "Captain's Log" conspicuously incorporating the giveaway generative AI phrase, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data". But it was the instances of shoddy AI-generated localisation - used alongside professionally translated text - that drew the most criticism. One Portuguese subtitle translation, for instance, began, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese".
</p>
<p>
The discoveries weren't well-received, particularly given 11 Bit's failure to disclose its generative AI usage, but the studio has now responded, insisting some of the offending elements were used in error, while others were down to misjudgement. "We've seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i">statement on social media</a>, "and we feel it's important to clarify our approach and give you more context."
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary [work-in progress elements] during the development process and in a very limited manner," it insisted. "Our team has always prioritised meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game."
</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibwporrg2gr7pwwsjtznrsrhskfmxa5bzjrxpfvu5w26ki4eov33y" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i/app.bsky.feed.post/3lstiwaoxcc2i"><div lang="en"><p>We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— 11 bit studios | WISHLIST DEATH HOWL (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i?ref_src=embed">@11bitstudios.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:a564tr4carmvmz72gc2xog5i/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i?ref_src=embed">June 30, 2025 at 4:31 PM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
"During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated." The studio also shared a screenshot of the controversial assets - including the Captain's Log display - as they appear in-game, adding, "While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience".
</p>
<p>
As for those controversial translations, 11 Bit suggested these were limited to a "few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base." It says these "externally produced" assets were made without the team being "involved in the creative process", and were "added at the final stage of development". As such, "last-minute" translations were required, said to account for "just 0.3 percent" of in-game text. "Due to extreme time constraints," 11 Bit continued, "we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localised using AI to have them ready on launch."
</p>
<p>
"It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localisation hotfix," the studio added, "to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented... The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English-speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit didn't address why it had chosen not to disclose the use of AI-generated content on Steam, despite Valve's mandatory requirements, nor has it added the disclosure since being called out. "As AI tools evolve," it concluded, "they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We're actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit isn't the only studio to face criticism for its generative AI usage, of course. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3 studio Frontier Developments announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-3-is-ditching-its-ai-generated-art-after-some-initial-feedback">removing the game's AI generated scientist avatar art</a> in response to "some initial feedback", while Activision and Microsoft have respectively been criticised for producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">AI-generated Call of Duty promotional art</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-muse-microsofts-gen-ai-game-tool-everyone-hates-whats-really-going-on-and-why-is-it-being-marketed-at-xbox-fans">AI-generated playable demo "inspired" by Quake 2</a>. As Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale reported last year, however, for all the controversy surrounding AI, it's clear the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">technology is changing game development forever</a>.

<p>Move comes due to "market conditions"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch OLED" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c39d84c0d7ce/switch-oled.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced it will change the price for a whole bunch of its products in Canada, citing "market conditions" for the move.</p>
<p>This comes via <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html">Newswire</a>, with more information on specific prices coming directly from Nintendo of Canada on <strong>1st August 2025</strong>. The official announcement specifically mentions "price changes", but let's face it, we all know they're probably going up, not down.</p>
<p>Here's a list of products expected to be affected from the price changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Switch - OLED Model</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Lite</li>
<li>Digital and Physical Games</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Accessories</li>
<li>amiibo</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Online Memberships</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the good news (if you can call it that) is that the Switch 2 seemingly won't be affected by the move – at least for now. Nintendo specifically states that "This pricing change does not apply to the Nintendo Switch 2 system, accessories, or software", so that's good to know.</p>
<p>Nintendo had previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-is-delaying-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">delayed its intended pre-order launch date for the Switch 2 in Canada</a>, stating that it wanted to align its plans with North America, which had also seen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-the-us-amidst-new-trump-tariffs">a delay of its own as a direct result of uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the region</a>.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is seemingly not going anywhere after President Donald Trump recently stated he would be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg629n7wzvo">"terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada"</a>. Trade talks are, however, set to resume after Canada ditched its digital services tax on tech companies.</p>

One problem with this is that controls get switched around once your weapons are equipped. That’s not to say you can’t use both!</p><p><strong>If you hold down L1 while holding a weapon, you can push in the left stick to shoot your slinger.</strong> The one drawback is that heavy ammo, such as Heavy Slicing Pods, can’t be used with most weapons equipped. Only the Sword and Shield can freely use any Slinger ammo type.</p><h2 id="h132434"><a id="4"></a>There is a separate Slinger item bar</h2><figure id="" data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-recommend-id="image://97f95cc0c52b88d6daf06004fad053ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hunter charges toward a Gypceros with the Slinger item bar in the bottom right corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up, you guessed it, is another shortcut for your Slinger. This one also goes hand-in-hand with the previous shortcut. Since all the craftable Slinger ammo takes spots in your inventory, you might think that you can only equip them from that menu. Fortunately, there is a more practical option.</p><p><strong>While holding down L1/LB, you can press L2/LT to bring up an item bar list limited to Slinger-related items from your inventory.</strong> I’ve found this to be a huge time-saver in contrast to swiping through everything I’m carrying. I do want to emphasize that it will only include items from your inventory. Any you pick up from the environment or off of monsters will not be included in this tiny item bar.</p><h2 id="h132435"><a id="5"></a>You can gather some resources without looking at them</h2><figure id="" data-id="86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-recommend-id="image://86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-recommend-id="image://86729ff2c337fe1814788d25c9ed869d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="In a corner of Wyveria, a hunter highlights different items in their area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each area in the game is home to numerous materials. Gathering these are vital for crafting new items, forging new gear, and even finding rare items to trade for. None of that changes how tedious or occasionally inconvenient the process can be. Thankfully, there is a feature mentioned early on that could be a big help.</p><p>Holding down L2/LT will bring up a list on the left side of the screen of interactable items within your slinger’s range. You’ll then be able to do the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pressing up or down on the d-pad will cycle through this list</li><li>Pressing left or right on the d-pad will cycle through this list and point your camera towards it.

Thankfully, there is a quick-select option.</p><p><strong>The trick to quickly select your secondary Mantle is to hold L1/LB and then press R2/RT.</strong> Your hunter will immediately equip it, even when a weapon is equipped. Using this shortcut again will have them remove the mantle.

Why only for Canada and not the rest of North America remains to be seen. Nintendo went out of its way to stress that the Switch 2, currently $450, will not see its price go up. However, amiibo and Switch Online memberships will be included in the pricing changes. New amiibo in the U.S. already jumped to a whopping $30 each. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lfm4uu/30_price_for_amiibos_is_not_doing_well_for/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lfm4uu/30_price_for_amiibos_is_not_doing_well_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans haven’t been impressed</a></span>. </p><p>The seemingly likely price hikes come as other console makers raise prices across the board.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The card-based, narrative-driven RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Sultan’s Game</u></a> just dropped its latest update alongside new DLC. There’s new story content, a downloadable soundtrack, new cards, and the base game is on sale for 15% as part of the Steam Summer Sale right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren’t familiar with Sultan’s Game, the story begins with a tyrannical sultan who has experienced every vice and pleasure life has to offer, and he’s grown bored. But then a mysterious sorceress arrives with a card game meant only for the realm’s most powerful people. Each round of the game assigns you a Sultan Card and tasks you with destroying it, but each card has different requirements to defeat it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cards come in four different types with four different tiers within those types. The four card types are Carnality, Bloodshed, Conquest, and Extravagance. You sate Carnality cards with nights of passion, feed the hunger of Bloodshed cards with living sacrifices, fulfill Conquest cards by capturing locations, and satisfy Extravagance cards with wealth and treasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/stone-carnality-card-description-1751305123213.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each card also comes in one of four tiers of increasing value: stone, bronze, silver, and gold. To defeat a Sultan Card, you must use a card of equal or higher value. So, for instance, if you need to destroy a silver Bloodshed card, then you must kill a character card that’s either silver or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game is played with cards, in-world those cards represent real people, so sacrificing cards means killing actual subjects. As you might expect, this is just the kind of game a tyrannical ruler would love. But you don’t play as the sultan — at least, not after the tutorial. You are one of his courtiers who had the courage to call out the game for its cruelty and depravity. Your punishment? The sultan puts you in charge of playing the game and having to make life-or-death decisions to defeat each Sultan Card. If you fail, he’ll execute you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beginning of each round will see you draw a new Sultan Card, and you’ll have seven days to figure out how to destroy it. There are activities available each day, and you can choose which activities to send cards in your deck to do. But you’ll need to be strategic about which activities you do each day and which cards you assign to them. Seven days can go by quickly, and there are limited resources at your disposal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/overworld-map-1751305170813.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of those activities require dice rolls to determine if your chosen cards are successful. When you end the day, text-based scenes will play out based on who did what, whether they were successful, and your rewards. The primary rewards are gold coins (which can be used to gain access to other activities) or information cards (which can be used for a variety of things), but as the game progresses, more events get added with more varied results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the story will be shaped by how you decide to approach each task and how moral or immoral you choose to be. Will you willingly go along with the sultan or secretly plot behind his back? Will you stay loyal to your wife or spend your free time at the local brothel? How will you treat the strangers that cross your path?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/story-choice-1751305201280.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what decisions you make, butterfly effects will follow in their wake, some of which won’t show themselves until long after you’ve made the initial choice. Some decisions might seem innocuous at first, but the story branches they open can continue branching from there and end up with wildly different outcomes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these decisions will test your morality. That starts as soon as the game begins, when you choose the background of your main character and his wife. Are you kind and charming or strong and intimidating? Are you a slave owner (this is a sultan’s court, after all) or a more enlightened friend of the nobility? Your starting deck and stats will be determined by the choices you make during this setup, but the moral decisions only get more complicated from there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/personal-background-1751304762377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t give any spoilers here, but we will say that there are some truly dark and extreme choices you can make, and they can dramatically alter the course of the story and the things you experience in your playthrough. You’ll have to grapple with questions like, “Who am I willing to kill?” and “What makes one person’s life more valuable than another?” Some moments might elicit excitement, others fear, and others maybe even disgust. A single playthrough takes about 10 hours, but seeing every ending can easily run you to 150+ hours, so there are lots of different paths to take.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story has an extensive script, and the latest update refined that script. It also added new Steam badges, community items, and 10 new cards crowdsourced from the community (pictured below). But the biggest new additions come in the form of two DLCs: a downloadable soundtrack and prequel story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/items-being-added-1751304688733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The OST features 15 original tracks by Zeta and international artists, and it’s a fusion of Uyghur Muqam, guzheng, and Western orchestration that’s meant to represent the cross-cultural atmosphere of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prequel DLC is a digital novella called A Game for the Sultan, which will let fans read the original story that inspired development of the game. Written by the game’s lead writer, it takes place in the sultan’s court, tells a standalone story, and delves into the origin of the dreaded Sultan Cards and how they first corrupted a sultan’s court.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/novel-capsule-1751304712045.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sultan’s Game and its DLCs are currently exclusive to PC and are available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, it was discovered that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/05/24/aiming-to-replicate-success">The Alters</a>, 11 Bit Studios’ sci-fi narrative management game, included undisclosed use of generative AI in its background flavor text, translations, and image assets. The ensuing anger from players has sullied the reputation of the otherwise well-received title, and the developer has issued a response.</p><p>The Alters launched on June 13 to positive reviews, but the discourse began this past weekend when players began sharing their discoveries of AI prompts for background flavor text as well as translated subtitles. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vysetron.pixeldie.com/post/3lsc3n4zhfc2k">One Bluesky post </a>showed a screenshot of a computer display with generic science text accompanied by a prompt reading, “Sure, here’s a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data.”</p><p>Other players found the localization of various languages has clear evidence of being generated using AI due to bizarre or outright incorrect translations, or simply displayed similar AI prompts. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/windblow.org/post/3lsomoc4mac2g">One example shared on Bluesky </a>is from one of the in-game licensed movies, in which a subtitle, translated to Brazilian Portuguese, reads "Sure! The text translated to Brazilian Portuguese is: Every conversation two people can have, right? So we-"</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/965Km7t6KwM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/965Km7t6KwM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Honestly, a beautiful game but I don’t get why the devs felt it was necessary to use genAI," reads on negative <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/">Steam review</a>. "The icons for Earth Calls seem to use AI (or concept art refurbished through AI). Flavour text on one of the displays contains a piece of original prompt. Heavy AI use in its marketing. But worst of all the translation has major problem with AI. So far I noticed Russian, German and Portuguese all having lines straight up saying something like “Sorry, I don’t know how to translate Moollie. Can you give more context as to what it means?” or just prompt text instead of actual lines. It’s heartbreaking to see such unique artistic vision ruined by AI. I am very disappointed in an otherwise good game. i hope the devs will listen and fix it in the future."</p><p>The other big sticking point is 11Bit's lack of transparency regarding its use of AI. Since January 2024, Steam requires games to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618">disclose</a> if a game features AI-created content, both pre- and live-generated. At launch, The Alters’ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/">Steam page</a> did not include this disclaimer. "Generative AI use is not acceptable, reads another Steam user. "Undisclosed generative AI use is even less so. I would not have purchased with this information, and I will not be buying from 11 bit again."</p>

<p>Today, 11Bit has shared a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i">lengthy response on social media</a>. The developer states it used certain AI-generated assets strictly as temporary placeholders in a “very limited manner." The studio claims one particular AI-generated graphic meant as a development placeholder for a piece of background texture snuck into the final release due to “an internal oversight”. 11Bit claims this asset is being updated, while also sharing a screenshot of the graphic in question, explaining, “While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gameplay experience.”</p><p>For the translation issues stemming from the localization of the licensed movies featured in the game, 11Bit says those were added during the late stages of development and were externally produced; thus, it was not involved in that creative process. Furthermore, these elements required last-minute translations, and the studio cites “extreme time constraints” for why it did not utilize its usual translation partners, instead turning to AI in order to localize the videos by launch. 11Bit says updated translations are in the process of being implemented.</p>

</article>
<p>11Bit also points out that the offending translations for those external movies represent 0.3 percent of the overall text in the game (10K words out of 3.4 million across multiple languages). It says the alternative was to release those specific lines of dialogue only in English, which it believed would be a worse decision. “In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call,” says 11Bit.</p><p>The studio also apologizes for not disclosing its use of AI, saying, “Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know.”</p><p>You can read 11Bit’s full response below (click the image to enlarge):</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-studios-will-reveal-what%E2%80%99s-next-for-the-halo-series-at-halowc-2025.1232073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Halo Studios, the new name for the studio formerly known as 343 Industries, will reveal what's next for the Halo series in October 2025 at the Halo World Championship 2025 event.</p>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june">Halo Waypoint website</a>, the team addressed that there have been rumors floating around about what's next for the series. The post doesn't single out any specific rumor, like the rumors about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Master Chief Collection</a> coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch 2, or that the next Halo game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">release on PlayStation </a>alongside its Xbox and PC releases. </p>



<p>But it does confirm that it will be "<em>continuing the conversation</em>" it began at last year's HaloWC, where it announced Project Foundry, the team's switch to using Unreal Engine 5, and the studio name change from 343 Industries to Halo Studios. </p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>"<em>Over the past few weeks, there's been a fair bit of speculation about when and where more details might emerge about any of the multiple projects Halo Studios is actively working on,</em>" the studio began. "<em>We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event</em>."</p><p>"<em>Last year at HaloWC,</em> <em>we premiered 'A New Dawn' where we talked about the switch to Unreal Engine, gave you a behind the scenes look at Project Foundry, and debuted our evolution to Halo Studios as we enter a new chapter for Halo. For us, 'A New Dawn' was just the beginning - at this year's HaloWC, we look forward to continuing the conversation.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship. We really hope you'll join us in Seattle this October!</em>"</p></div>



<div><p>The last major entry into the long-running shooter series was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/">Halo Infinite</a>, which was a mostly well-made game for all intents and purposes, but failed to take over the world in the same way new Halo games have done in the past. </p><p>Whatever Halo Studios has planned for the series, it is arguably the most important release for the Halo franchise yet. If it's not a success, it's worth asking whether Microsoft continues the series at all. That might feel like an insane thought, that Microsoft and Xbox would stop making Halo games. But a few short years ago, so did the idea that Microsoft would publish its first-party developed games on PlayStation and Nintendo devices. </p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/date-everything-will-make-you-see-your-favorite-household-objects-in-a-sexy-new-light.1232070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://dateeverything.com/"><em>Date Everything!</em></a> isn’t the dating sim it appears to be. Though the game’s cutesy art style and lighthearted premise indicate an unserious game that’s making yet another joke at the expense of the genre, <em>Date Everything </em>actually contains novel explorations of human relationships and sharp-as-shit political critique. </p><p><em>Date Everything</em> (the title technically includes an exclamation point) is a game where you, with the help of special glasses called “dateviators,” can turn everyday household objects into potential romantic partners. Every in-game day you’re given five opportunities to find new and talk to already discovered characters called dateables. As you interact with them, the things you say and do influence their feelings for you. Winning a dateable’s love, hate, or friendship will also increase the level of one of your personality traits — smarts, poise, empathy, charm, and sass — which unlocks more advanced dialogue responses. Say the right thing, and Dorian (your door, voiced by Ben Starr) will be your best friend boosting your poise. Say the wrong thing and your toilet Jean-Loo Pissoir (Max Mittelman) will swear eternal enmity, boosting your sassiness.</p><p><em>Date Everything</em> is your favorite voice actor’s favorite video game. The game is a veritable murderers’ row of video game voice actors. Neil Newbon, Ben Starr, Ray Chase, Debra Wilson, Felicia Day, Ashley Johnson, Ashly Burch, and more lend their voices to this project. To borrow a line from <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/EXnbMp1yr1k?si=z5DPmI4qvz6YcNlC">everyone is here</a> and they’re delivering high-quality performances more associated with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/653315/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-interview-andy-serkis"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6110091/hatoful-boyfriend"><em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em></a>. </p><p>I love how you don’t have to dig through the credits to know who voices what, as each dateable is given a biography which includes their voice performer. This approach makes sense because <em>Date Everything</em> was created by them. Ray Chase (Noctis Lucis Caelum, <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>), Robbie Daymond (Tuxedo Mask!!), and Max Mittelman (Ryuji Sakamoto, <em>Persona 5</em>) founded Sassy Chap Games. <em>Date Everything</em> is the studio’s first title that’s found viral success mainly because it’s giving the dating sim community — one that’s been left to languish on jokey cast-offs and the odd Valentine’s Day-themed events — exactly what they want: their favorite performers having fun. Every performer in<em> Date Everything</em> is having the time of their lives and you can hear it in their performances. Upon meeting Curt (Davied Morales) and Rod (Jacquis Neal) — any guesses as to what they are — I was delighted by their shade-throwing shenanigans.</p><p>What those faves are saying is just as important as who’s saying it. The game’s dialogue is sharp and hilarious, stuffed with puns and clever wordplay — but make the right choices and it can veer into adult territory that doesn’t feel too corny or vulgar. I was giggling and kicking my feet flirting with my vacuum cleaner (Zeno Robinson) because of the suggestiveness of some of our conversations. </p><p>I’ve never been able to fully inhabit the self-insert characters I play in dating sims mainly because the dialogue options I choose and what I hear hardly ever reflect things I’d actually say or hear in real life. The biggest appeal of<em> Date Everything</em> is that it’s written in a way that closes some of the distance between me the person and me the character in the game. My vacuum cleaner had lines that would have legit worked on me.</p><p>Another trait that has me swiping right on <em>Date Everything</em> is how it’s constructed. Dateables run the gamut of ethnicities, sexualities, and body types. There’s a neat, built-in content warning feature that lets players know if talking to a particular dateable might bring up potentially triggering topics. Every line of dialogue is fully voiced and every new interaction with a dateable comes with a voiced description of the character, a boon for low-vision players. </p><p>The game also lets you know precisely the politics of its creators in incredibly rad and funny ways. Within seconds of starting the story, I was newly hired then promptly fired by the tech megacorporation that developed the dateviators because my job had been automated by AI. Throughout the game, I’ll get updates from the CEO, which are part hilarious interludes, part scathing criticisms of the video game industry. At one point, the CEO fired the company’s event planner in the same breath he praised her for running a successful event. During one message, the CEO was begging for the dateviators back — stolen in a moment of corporate sabotage — because they’ve promised the technology to the, and I friggin’ quote, “US government’s department of Overseas Violence.” A dig that could be aimed at any number of companies, including one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">very obvious one</a>.</p><p>There’s a tendency in the dating sim community to get reflexively defensive against cutesy-looking dating sims, especially those developed in the West. While the genre is a staple with a storied history, typically these games are treated as a joke. I am frequently annoyed when a big game publisher announces it’s making one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640147/palworld-pubg-dating-sims">only for it to be a prank</a>. Or if one is released, it’s often <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/10/1/20891585/kfc-dating-simulator-branding">a short, unserious side project made for laughs</a>. There’s nothing wrong with that (pigeon dating game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/5/6110091/hatoful-boyfriend"><em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em> sends its regards</a>), but it gets grating when virtually every release is done for the lolz.</p><p><em>Date Everything </em>feels like it should be one of those pranks. But in the same way I didn’t realize how sexy a vacuum cleaner could be until I talked to him, you won’t know how serious and special <em>Date Everything</em> is until you try it.</p><p><sub>Date Everything <em>is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/695123/date-everything-review-sassy-chap-games]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has strongly suggested that the original Switch is about to get more expensive for millions of people.

GameSpot has contacted Nintendo in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Whatever the case, the pricing changes do not apply to the Switch 2 console, games, or accessories.

<figure><a title="Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0e093ec3bac6/elden-ring-tarnished-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all may still be waiting for an official release date, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> has finally secured a Switch 2 rating from the ESRB.</p>
<p>As brought to our attention on Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe" tabindex="-1">@necrolipe</a>, the game's official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">ESRB listing</a> has been updated with an M ( Mature 17+) rating, noting that it contains "Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, and Violence," <em>and</em> "in-game purchases".</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the ESRB website, which goes into the specifics behind the rating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of a character trying to retrieve a magical ring and become the Elden Lord. From a third-person perspective, players explore environments, collect items, and battle various enemies (e.g., knights, fantastical creatures) in melee combat. Players use swords, spears, axes, arrows, and magic to enemies; combat is highlighted by cries of pain, splatters of blood, and impact sounds. The game includes depictions of gore: collectible items that include severed fingers and tongues; a boss character cutting off its arm; severed arms hanging from a ceiling. During the course of the game, a humanoid monster is depicted partially nude, with scales/scars covering its breast and pelvic regions. The word “sh*t” appears in the dialogue.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is hardly all that surprising when we consider that the original Elden Ring, its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and Nightreign all received an identical 'M' from the ratings board, but hey, it might imply that things are progressing behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The upcoming Switch 2 release wasn't specifically mentioned in the recently revealed line-up for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/bandai-namcos-summer-showcase-promises-plenty-of-switch-news-later-this-week">Bandai Namco's Summer Showcase</a>, but there's every chance that it <em>might</em> make an appearance, with a release date attached. For now, we can only dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> ban list update is here. Wizards of the Coast's latest change to their widely popular card game includes an "early rotation" for the popular Standard format, banning seven cards from competitive play.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, several members of Magic's design team, Carmen Klomparens, Jadine Klomparens, Arya Karamchandani, Garvin Varhey, and Dave Finseth, broke down the Magic: The Gathering ban list update and explained their process.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-ban-list-update-cori-steel-cutter-card-artwork.jpg?itok=VbhosPdS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-ban-list-update-cori-steel-cutter-card-artwork.jpg?itok=KOIt6fZM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As mentioned before, the format changing the most from this ban list is Standard format. Officially, seven cards are now banned from Standard, which is a lot according to Jadinee Klomparens. Those seven cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Cori-Steel Cutter</em></li>
	<li><em>Abuelo's Awakening</em></li>
	<li><em>Monstrous Rage</em></li>
	<li><em>Heartfire Hero</em></li>
	<li><em>Up the Beanstalk</em></li>
	<li><em>Hopeless Nightmare</em></li>
	<li><em>This Town Ain't Big Enough</em></li>
</ul><p>There is a lot to unpack. The biggest offender on this list is Cori-Steel Cutter. It is a key card in the Izzet Prowess deck, represented in 40% of the Standard format meta at the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-spotlight-event-is-coming-to-japan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Pro Tour</a>.</p>

<p>According to the post, Izzet Prowess is having an overall negative effect on the meta. This is why <em>Cori-Steel Cutter</em> is getting banned, it is too strong compared to everything else. Low cost, big impact, still affects the battlefield even if it's destroyed quickly. For the long-term health of the game, it is a sensible ban.</p>

<p>As for the other bans in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list update, they are mostly for similar reasons. <em>Monstrous Rage</em> is too strong in mono-red decks so it's out. Same thing with <em>Heartfire Hero</em>. <em>Abuelo's Awakening</em> has synergized too well with <em>Omniscience</em>, so it's on the list. <em>Up The Beanstalk</em> has been on ban lists before in Modern format, and it is now banned in Standard for similar reasons.</p>

<p><em>Hopeless Nightmare</em> has proven to be too potent in self-bounce decks, making it a disruptive, aggressive deck. Finally, <em>This Town Ain't Big Enoug</em>h, when parred with <em>Stormchaser's Talent</em>, leads to a lot of momentum-killing endgame lock-outs. So to keep things fun, it is now banned.</p>

<p>Overall, this updated ban list is a measured change for the game. As for how this will change the competitive meta, that is something only time can tell.</p>

Amazon reportedly tried to offer better labeling to make it clear which products were coming officially from Nintendo and which ones weren’t, but that apparently wasn’t enough to mend the relationship. </p><p> “There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers,” a spokesperson for Nintendo told Bloomberg. Amazon also played dumb, calling the reporting “inaccurate” and stating that it was “pleased to offer Nintendo products directly to our customers as part of our commitment to providing an exceptional shopping experience with the widest selection possible.” </p><p>Those products it does offer include the original Switch and first-party games for it, as well as third-party releases for the Switch 2 like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The Switch 2 and its Nintendo games, however, remain absent. Search for <em>Mario Kart World </em>and you will instead get listings for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Two notable exceptions: you can currently pre-order both <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. </p><p>Has the beef been squashed, or are these pre-orders for upcoming games just a test run to see if Amazon can <em>allegedly</em> get back into Nintendo’s good graces? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-screenshots-release-date-trailer-planet-1851772753"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></span>, also launching this year, does not have a pre-order listing. In fact, Amazon canceled previously placed pre-orders for the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hywkdq/amazon_is_canceling_metroid_prime_4_beyond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hywkdq/amazon_is_canceling_metroid_prime_4_beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this year</a></span>. </p><p>Meanwhile, online deals retailer Woot, which is owned by Amazon, frequently sells physical copies of Nintendo’s Switch 1 games at steep discounts. <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> are all $15 off at the moment. Even<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em> is just $48. Buy it and pay $10 for the  upgrade and you’re effectively saving $22 off the sticker price of a Switch 2 launch game. I’m sure Nintendo’s not pissed about that at all.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-amazon-pokemon-za-donkey-kong-preorder-1851785352]]></content:encoded>

Let’s run it back. #CBB #ItsInTheGame” The CBB likely stands for “College Basketball.” Alongside this message, EA posted a photo of a basketball with the EA Sports logo slapped on it.

Even more impressive, according to Mat Piscatella, executive director and video game industry advisor at Circana, last year’s college football game has already landed in the top 50 best-selling games of all time in the United States. So yeah, you can see why EA might be interested in doing a college basketball game again. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339]]></content:encoded>

The game is available now on console and PC not just for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but also the less-expensive Game Pass Standard tier.</p><p>Originally released in 2017, Call of Duty: WWII was developed by Sledgehammer Games and was notable at the time in part for being the first WWII-set CoD game since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Some of its most memorable missions including the Saving Private Ryan-like D-Day opening sequence and a mission where you go undercover in a German building in Paris featuring some tense moments.</p><p>You play as Ronald "Red" Daniels, with supporting squadmates including soldiers voiced by people like Josh Duhamel, Jeffrey Pierce, Jonathan Tucker, and Brett Zimmerman. The campaign's intensity is ramped up by the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2-ditching-health-regen-has-some-fo/1100-6449627/" data-ref-id="1100-6449627">there is no automatic health regeneration.</a></p><p>CoD: WWII is also fondly remembered by players for its Headquarters social space, which is similar to The Tower from Bungie's Destiny in that it's a big open space <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2s-headquarters-trailer-reveals-its/1100-6452757/" data-ref-id="1100-6452757">where players can mingle together and even challenge players to 1v1 matches.</a> People have been petitioning Activision to bring back Headquarters, or something like it, ever since--but it's never happened.</p><p>The multiplayer mode, meanwhile, was notable for using a simplified "Divisions" system, which replaced the create-a-class system from earlier games. CoD: WWII also has a Nazi Zombies mode.

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Ghost of Tsushima review, I said, ”&nbsp;“Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei is due to be released on October 2nd exclusively for PS5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-dev-admits-it-used-genai-with-some-assets-%E2%80%9Cmistakenly%E2%80%9D-left-in-the-game-while-other-uses-were-intentional.1232004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/">The Alters</a> developer, 11 bit Studios, has addressed allegations that generative AI technology was used in the game's development, admitting that it did use GenAI tech when making the game, though in some cases it was never meant to be in the final version. While other instances were intentional choices the team made due to "<em>time constraints</em>."</p>



<p>The Alters released earlier this month to strong critical acclaim, with the game currently sitting at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-alters/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">84 on Metacritic</a>, with both critics and players praising its narrative woven between different versions of one person. However, over the weekend it faced its first dash of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation">controversy</a> after players discovered what they believed to be confirmation that 11 bit Studios used generative AI technology when making The Alters. </p>



<p>A major sticking point for players regarding the use of GenAI is how 11 bit studios used it for localization purposes, with players citing poor translations for Portuguese, Russian, and German, though the most significant aspect of 11 bit Studios using GenAI that has upset players is the fact that 11 bit Studios did not disclose they had used the technology. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618">Valve's updated rules</a> for games published on Steam, the use of GenAI to produce the final product that's sold on the digital storefront must be disclosed to players. At the time of this writing, the disclosure is not on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/">The Alters Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>Now, we have 11 bit Studios side of the story, with <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1939707458152448118">a long statement published to the game's official X account</a>, where the team explains how one of the instances players have brought up was never meant to make it into the final version of the game. It also provides a screenshot of where the GenAI text can be found, showing how little of the game screen real estate it takes up, and claims it to be an isolated mistake, though says it isn't trying to "<em>downplay</em>" the situation.</p>



<p>"<em>AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game</em>," the studio writes at the top of its statement. </p>



<p>"<em>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other choices, like using GenAI for localization work, it admits, were intentional choices made due to time constraints that it now says were "<em>the wrong call."</em> 11 bit Studios also claims that it always intended to go back and release a hotfix for the proper translations.</p>



<p>"<em>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented</em>."</p>



<p>11 bit Studios goes on to describe just how little of the game's text is GenAI, and how it wanted to have translations for the aforementioned films to ensure that it didn't only feature the English dialogue while localization work for other languages continued. "<em>In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know</em>."</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-steam-labs-dev-claims-1-000-steam-games-use-generative-ai">plenty of games</a> that use generative AI technology in development, whether as part of the process without intending GenAI assets to be in the final game, or as part of the final product. Like it or not, generative AI technology is part of the modern game development landscape, and it isn't going away anytime soon. It's clear that 11 bit Studios' biggest fumble here wasn't just using GenAI for a poor band-aid solution to its problems, but trying to sneak its GenAI use past players, hoping to patch the game before anyone noticed.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how Steam reacts to this, and if the storefront's rules around the disclosure of GenAI, and the failure disclose, will result in punitive action against developers who take the risk of trying to sneak GenAI assets past Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I had totally forgotten that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> was in development alongside a new Resident Evil multiplayer game, which (at the risk of yet again inflating my own importance) is perhaps why Capcom have just shut the latter down. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evils-multiplayer-spin-off-reverse-is-shutting-down-later-this-year">promised earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-reverse">Resident Evil Re:Verse</a> is no more. Capcom have burned down the game’s storefront listing, taken a shovel to its DLC pages, and now put a pitchfork through the servers. Run tell the peasantfolk that the beast is finally dead.</p><!--more-->
<p>When they confirmed the suspension of support, Capcom said that they released Re:Verse back in 2022 to celebrate the original game's 25th anniversary. The game peaked at 2080 concurrent players on Steam, which is not exactly Counter-Strike numbers, but Capcom feel nonetheless that "Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably". Ah, this reminds me of me telling my mother that I had an intimidating persona when nobody showed up for my 16th birthday party.</p>
<p>RE:Verse was a six player third-person shooter featuring a cross-section of nods to older Resident Evils, including the ability to chug a potion and transform into a celebrity baddy such as Resident Evil 7’s chainshear-wielding scruffer Jack Baker. It was the latest in Capcom’s quixotic efforts to make a multiplayer Resi, a quest that has given us such wibbly fare as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city">Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City</a>, which Richard Cobbett <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city">summarised</a> as “not so much bad as grindingly unenthusiastic”. </p>
<p>I’m not aware of an all-timer multiplayer Resident Evil game but they were getting there with the co-op features for games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a>, and Resident Evil Outbreak – a multiplayer survival game set in Raccoon City – should have been a doozie. In Capcom’s defence, they released that back in primordial 2003, when online was a novelty, and online Japanese games especially had you communicating with the servers by means of a specially trained seagull. I’ve still got my seagull from the dial-up days. He’s running a major publisher now. I won’t tell you which one, but let’s just say that the guano rolls downhill at Ubisoft Inc.</p>
<p>While Re:Verse is most assuredly dead - the fate of <a hef="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-of-games-with-online-requirements-are-doomed-according-to-stop-killing-games-survey">70% of games that have online requirements</a>, according to one study - Capcom continue to chase the tipsy T-viral daydream of Resident Evil multiplayer. According to the most recent round of Resident Evil Requiem developer interviews, they <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/capcom-ditches-online-plans-for-resident-evil-requiem/ar-AA1HyiP1">toyed with</a> another online-focussed Resident Evil before moving ahead with Requiem’s premise of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">stuck in a hotel with a stampeding hag</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-finally-put-a-bullet-in-resident-evil-reverse-but-havent-entirely-given-up-on-resident-evil-online]]></content:encoded>

However,<strong> ES Fulghor seemingly starts in the original’s second phase and will use its most dangerous move: the one where it charges up an aura to summon blades of lightning from the ground</strong>. Lightning elemental attacks will break its guard and prevent it from executing that attack.</p><p>Any class composition will suffice as long as players are skilled enough, but <strong>having more melee based classes like </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-play-guardian-tank-defend-magic-1851783574&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-play-guardian-tank-defend-magic-1851783574"><strong>Guardian</strong></a></span><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-guide-onslaught-claw-shot-1851783361"><strong>Wylder</strong></a></span><strong>, </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-executor-beast-dexterity-arcane-1851784376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-executor-beast-dexterity-arcane-1851784376"><strong>Executor</strong></a></span><strong>, and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-raiden-ultimate-art-strength-1851783752&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-raiden-ultimate-art-strength-1851783752"><strong>Raider</strong></a></span><strong> will be useful</strong>. Fulghor hits hard and is very aggressive, so you’ll need players who can dish out damage just as well as they take.</p><h2 id="h148920"><a id="2"></a>Fighting Everdark Soveriegn Fulghor</h2><p>ES Fulghor retains most of its normal attacks, which involve swiping its giant weapon on the ground and creating shockwaves. The swipe itself is easy to dodge, but there’s a delay between the shockwave’s emergence, which can be a bit difficult to avoid. When Fulghor swipes at you, it’s best to dodge <em>towards</em> it, so you don’t get caught in the shockwave after.</p><p>Visually, one of the biggest changes to Fulghor is that it now has its other arm back! It’ll still grow out that grotesque purple arm, though, just like the normal version. When Fulghor reveals the giant purple arm, it’ll slam the ground, unleashing a purple shockwave AOE. This attack comes out incredibly fast, and you’re very unlikely to outrun the blast radius, so your best option is to time your dodge to avoid it.</p><figure id="" data-id="3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-recommend-id="image://3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1101" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-recommend-id="image://3b7747ed767133e3662ebedb80045580" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1101" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ES Fulghor falls to the ground to deliver an attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>ES Fulghor carries over its rush attack from its normal version. Here, Fulghor will charge at you a few times, leaving a trail of explosive light behind. It takes a few seconds for the light trail to blow up, so it’s to just move out of the way.</p><p>One of ES Fulghor’s new tricks sees it floating up in the sky, and then creating “clouds” that shoot arrows of light towards the ground. The clouds can track your position, so be aware, but they will dissipate shortly. </p><figure id="" data-id="d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-recommend-id="image://d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-recommend-id="image://d901e44fdd5d9c1632efe2720d49a4d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Arrows rain down from the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fulghor can now also turn its weapon into a giant twinblade of light. It’ll then perform a 360 degree sweep around itself twice before jumping up and slamming the blade down into the ground, creating a small shockwave. The best way to avoid these attacks is to just dodge-roll through them.</p><p>Last and certainly not least, ES Fulghor’s new most dangerous attack is when it gallops into the air and charges up a giant arrow of light. This attack has an absolutely huge AOE radius and is hard to run away from. Your best option here is to have the entire team disperse in different directions so that when Fulghor targets one of you, the other two are far away enough to avoid the explosion that comes after the arrow.</p><figure id="" data-id="3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-recommend-id="image://3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-recommend-id="image://3690a09cd30bc4ec0e61247a097efc24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players run from a massive arrow attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After defeating Fulghor, you’ll earn 25 Sovereign Sigils, which can be spent at the new Collector Signboard outside of the castle hub area. With the introduction of ES Fulghor, there’s a new Relic based on it called the Dark Night of the Champion. It costs 12 Sovereign Sigils to purchase and comes with the following effects:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Increased Maximum Stamina</li><li>Boosts Attack Power of Added Affinity Attacks</li><li>Defeating enemies fills more of the Art gauge</li></ul><p>Everdark Sovereigns cycle in and out every week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-23">Pokémania 2025 isn't slowing down</a>, which means trainers need to be savvy about their sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">Pokémon TCG</a> purchases. Whilst buying at MSRP is become the stuff of legend, it's always good practice to see what products are selling for on the secondary market compared to big box stores such as Amazon. The same goes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">Magic: The Gathering</a>. Luckily, I've gone through Amazon's current stock for both and found the best deals of these products to save trainers, wizards and witches a few dollars. I'm amazing, right?</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also gearing up for its 4-day Prime Day sale with some early deals and a massive 6-month free prime membership deal for anyone aged 18-24 in the US. then it's $7.49 thereafter. Cool, right? Speaking of staying cool, we've got a great deal on a neck fan and something to help get a cool nights sleep for way below MSRP. Let's get into it:</p><p id="amazon-prime-day-is-coming"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Amazon Prime Day Is Coming">Amazon Prime Day Is Coming</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223808"><div id="223808" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Prime Day Is Coming</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Deals are already live, Prime Day sales start July 8 and run through July 11</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We're all over Prime Days 2025, and some deals are going live now. For more information about the event and an inside scoop on hot deals and top tips, check out our Prime Day hub.</p></div><p id="6-months-free-amazon-prime-for-young"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young">6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young Adults</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223809"><div id="223809" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young Adults</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>$7.49 after free trial ends</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is a no-brainer. If your 18-24, snap up this 6-months free deal for Amazon Prime. It includes the free and fast delivery Amazon is known for alongside unlimited streaming, free delivery on GrubHub+, free Prime games every month and loads more.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution Pokémon Cards Are Climbing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"> I can't believe the X Y era of Pokémon cards came out 12 years ago, but it was an amazing era for the TCG introducing the Mega Evolution mechanic. Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.  Just the Charizards and Rayquazzas alone are worth a look.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">MTG doesn't seem to be struggling to keep up with demand despite it being one of the biggest trading card games on earth, but that doesn't stop big box retailers getting cheeky when they notice a peak in demand. Like with Pokémon TCG, i've gone through the majority of MTG stock on Amazon and compared their pricing to market values on TCG Player. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1vxV?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Theros Beyond Death booster</a> made me spit out my tea. Amazon is listing a single booster for $378.08, but these can be picked up <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgGme?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">any day of the week for $5.59 on TCG Player</a>. Go figure. Another big difference is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgnNN?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man - Play Booster Box</a>. Amazon has their preorder price guarantee on this, but it's still <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg6mn?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">17% cheaper to preorder on TCG Player</a>. </p><p id="waoaw-sleep-mask-w-3d-eye-cups-ad"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Ad">WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Adjustable Strap (Black)</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223810"><div id="223810" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Adjustable Strap (Black)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re sensitive to light while sleeping, this 3D contoured eye mask from WAOAW might be worth trying. It’s designed with deeper eye cavities so there’s no pressure on your lids, and the wide, adjustable strap helps it stay put without pulling at your hair. The material is soft and breathable, and it comes with earplugs and a travel pouch, which makes it a handy option for travel or quick naps.</p></div><p id="the-silmarillion-deluxe-illustrated"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated ">The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated by the Author</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223811"><div id="223811" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated by the Author</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't describe how much I need this work of art. This edition of the Silmarillion arrives in a deluxe stamped clothbound hardcover edition housed in a custom slipcase and lavishly illustrated with over 50 color pieces by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This collector's version presents the complete text in two-color print and includes exclusive extras like two fold-out maps of Beleriand, a booklet on the making of <em>The Silmarillion</em> by Christopher Tolkien, and a collectible art card. From the crafting of the Silmarils and Morgoth’s theft, to the fall of Númenor and the forging of the Rings of Power, this volume captures the vast mythological backdrop of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Beautifully quarterbound with foil-stamped black cloth boards, silver-edged pages, and a ribbon marker, it’s a definitive edition for Tolkien devotees.</p></div><p id="tunise-rechargeable-portable-neck-fa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fa">Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223812"><div id="223812" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fan that you don't have to hold because it sits comfortably around your neck. This is such a cool and handy product for under $15, especially if you're like me and get warm at the thought of some sunshine.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-audible"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Audible">3 Months for $0.99 Audible Deal</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223445"><div id="223445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Audible Premium Plus for $0.99</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Audible’s doing that 99c a month deal again for Premium Plus, and it’s a steal. Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
