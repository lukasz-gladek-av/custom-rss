            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to several gaming insiders, Ubisoft is currently working on a new multiplayer shooter. Furthermore, some concept art and even an in-progress screenshot of the game have been shown.</p>







<p>Ubisoft has had a fair share of shooters over the past 40 years. From the iconic Tom Clancy series to the wild Far Cry franchise, it’s served up quite a few good ones. Still, the company has only managed one success in the multiplayer FPS world: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a>. With many companies like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation/Bungie</a> and EA getting in on the trend, a supposed leak teases that Ubisoft wants in. Now, we may know what that vision the team is shooting for may look like, and it’s literally out of this world.</p>



<h2 id="h-project-scout-an-fps-sci-fi-competitive-shooter-from-ubisoft-possibly-leaked">Project Scout, An FPS Sci-Fi Competitive Shooter from Ubisoft, Possibly Leaked</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Twitter/X leaker Shiny <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/1988305728784744488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a message</a> surrounding a new multiplayer title from Ubisoft. The FPS, supposedly made in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, takes place in <strong>a sci-fi world</strong>. It would include <strong>competitive multiplayer</strong>, including <strong>crossplay</strong>, and be on <strong>a larger scale</strong> than other titles. </p>



<p>Later on, user 6leaks furthered Shiny’s claim, <a href="https://x.com/6leaksgg/status/1988397275266334782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posting screenshots of the title</a>, known as <strong>Project Scout</strong>. The images, seen above, show what appears to be a loading screen with concept art and an in-game screenshot with developing assets and the game’s UI. We can also see one of the characters on the bottom left, as well as some interesting interface systems like a compass and ‘crew level’.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft has not confirmed Project Scout or any new multiplayer game</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a grain of salt</strong>. We have reached out to Ubisoft to confirm and will update if and when we get a response. Regardless, the concept does look pretty cool, and it’ll be interesting to see, if true, how the core gameplay will work. </p>







<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s Project Scout? Do you think it’s real? Do you want it to be? Think it can make another multiplayer shooter and succeed? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Get ready for an even bigger launch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is on its way to the Switch 2 early next year, and Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have today revealed the "major DLC" for the title will be arriving on the same day.</p>
<p><strong>Visions of Four Heroes</strong> will add new stories and weapons when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$34.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent), and pre-orders are now live on select platforms. Once again, this is the same release date as the Switch 2 version. Here's some additional PR, and you can check out the overview trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visions of Four Heroes features brand-new stories centered around four heroes whose stories were not explored in <em>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS:</em> Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao and Lu Bu. These stories are explored as “What If” scenarios and will allow players to discover new sides to these legendary heroes. New companions are also featured in the major DLC including Zhuhe, a Guardian of Peace; Diaochan, a beautiful warrior and a familiar fan favorite; and a mysterious new officer who will be revealed as the story unfolds.</p>
<p>"Fans will also be able to enjoy new weapons – the “Bow” and “Rope Dart” – to further enhance the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 warfare by leveraging each weapon’s unique characteristics on the battlefield. Existing weapons will also receive an update, granting new arts, skill panels, as well as an increase in the trait level cap. Finally, a new “Training Ground” mode will be included, where players battle formidable foes while practicing their skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you pre-order the DLC, for a "limited time" you will also receive an exclusive outfit for the protagonist (the "Yellow Turban Attire"). Here's a little more information about this, and you can find out more about this upcoming release (in general), in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Designed to embody the heroic spirit of DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS, this costume lets players take to the battlefield clad in the symbolic garb of the Yellow Turban Rebellion."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Alongside a new story trailer today, Square Enix has released an eShop demo for its upcoming Switch and Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>This demo will allow you to experience the opening of the new game, including the first chapter of three different story arcs from the "Retribution story, as well as the first chapter of the "Restoration story" (or up to three hours of gameplay).</p>
<p>Save data will also carry across to the full release when it arrives next month on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3f24bc2675cee"><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f24bc2675cee/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's some extra information about what you can expect in the demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you’ll do is design your protagonist, and play through the explosive introduction to the game. You’ll discover how a joyful town festival turns to tragedy, and how your hero embarks on a journey of restoration and revenge.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You’ll set off after three antagonists, known as the Masters. Each of them has their own ‘Master of’ arc, and in the demo, you can play through the first chapter of each of them in any order you please.</p>
<p>You can also play up to the end of the first chapter of the ‘Kindlers of the Flame’ story arc, which focuses on the restoration of Wishvale and the town-building features of the game. It’s a great way to lay some strong foundations before you build the town of your dreams in the full game!</p>
<p>You can play through all this content for up to three hours. After that, the demo ends.</p>

Explore, survive, and extract from the Inferno, where stage layouts and item placements differ every match.</p><p>​In this game, on top of PvEvP—where players and enemies collide within Hell Gate—there is also a mode for battling exclusively with other players.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-inch-4k-fire-tv-suddenly-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-stock-for-pocket-change.1350715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 50-inch size hits the sweet spot for most living rooms and bedrooms, large enough for an immersive viewing experience without overwhelming your space. This <strong>Insignia F50 Series 4K Fire TV</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">just dropped to an all-time low of $179 on Amazon, down from its regular $299 price</a>. For this price, you’ll get a smart TV equipped with Ultra HD resolution, HDR10 support and built-in Fire TV streaming without the premium pricing that Samsung or LG demand for similar specs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>4K Resolution That Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>The 3840×2160 resolution supplies <strong>four times the pixel density of standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;which becomes evident when watching nature documentaries or sports where fine details make all the difference. Textures in clothes are finer, individual blades of grass on football fields are more distinguishable, and facial features during close-ups are sharper. The <strong>upscaling engine</strong> takes your existing HD content from cable boxes or Blu-ray players and upscales it to near-4K quality, filling in missing information via intelligent processing. This means that even older shows and movies look better than they did on your previous TV.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 opens up a wider color gamut</strong> than what standard dynamic range displays can show, and displays subtle gradations in bright skies and shadow details that might otherwise disappear to black. Sunsets contain more layers of orange and red rather than a flat blob of color, and dark movie scenes reveal details in shadows without washing out the overall image. This wider color gamut makes animated films pop with vibrant hues while live-action content receives a more realistic appearance that feels closer to what your eyes see in real life.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fire TV interface puts streaming apps front and center</strong> and removes the need for external streaming sticks or boxes that clutter your entertainment center. Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max load directly from the home screen, and the system remembers where you left off across different services. Voice control through the included Alexa remote lets you search for content by speaking actor names, movie titles, or even vague descriptions.</p>



<p>DTS Virtual-X processing does give simulated surround sound from the TV’s built-in speakers, and furthers dialogue clarity and adding spatial depth to action sequences. It analyzes the audio signal and adjusts the output of the speakers to create an impression of height and width that goes beyond the physical speaker placements. Of course, it is not a replacement for a dedicated sound system, but it considerably enhances the viewing experience compared to the thin, tinny audio that plagues budget TVs.</p>
<p>HDMI eARC support transmits full-resolution audio from streaming apps or connected devices to compatible soundbars and receivers without compression. This type of connection is used to handle more advanced audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X which need higher bandwidth than the standard HDMI ARC allows. You can attach a soundbar later with no concerns about limitations of audio quality and the automatic switching of the audio output when connecting compatible equipment occurs seamlessly.</p>
<p>The <strong>refresh rate of 60Hz handles standard TV content and movies smoothly,</strong> and refreshed the image 60 times per second so that motion blur does not occur when the camera pans or there is fast action on screen. Smart home integration allows Ring doorbell feeds, Philips Hue lights, or Nest thermostats to be accessed through the TV interface using voice commands. Content from iPhones and iPads can directly mirror onto the screen via Apple AirPlay, without the use of additional casting devices.</p>
<p>But this Insignia TV delivers on most people’s actual usage at a price point of just $179 for a 50-inch 4K display with streaming built in, rather than requiring months of budgeting.</p>

<p>PlayStation is entering the gaming monitor market with its very own PC monitor.</p>



<p>Announced at the end of Tuesday’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-november-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play Japan showcase</a>, the PlayStation Gaming Monitor is the first of its kind under the PlayStation brand. It’s also designed for use with both the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-gaming-monitor-s-features">What Are The Gaming Monitor’s Features?</h2>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor—not to be confused with Sony’s INZONE brand—comes in at 27″ with a Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display at a max 2K (2560 x 1440p) resolution. It also includes High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping. For refresh rates, the monitor supports up to 240 Hz on PC and 120 Hz on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles as well as Variable Refresh Rates (VRR). </p>



<p>One of the more unique features is the built-in charging hook for DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers.</p>







<p>Input wise, it has two HDMI 2.1 inputs and one DisplayPort 1.4 input. There are also two USB-A ports and one USB-C port. Lastly, the monitor has a built-in speaker and 3.5mm audio output while also being VESA compatible for mounting. </p>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor will launch sometime in 2026 though no sepecific date or price was confirmed. What was announced, however, was that it will only be available in the United States and Japan.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the PlayStation gaming monitor whenever it releases? </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-quietly-offloads-1tb-i7-laptop-on-amazon-73-off-while-official-site-stays-full-price-2000643068</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell keeps its official website at full price while quietly clearing inventory through Amazon ahead of Black Friday, and the deals are impossible to ignore. This 15.6-inch business laptop with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5461/">Intel Core i7 processor, 1TB SSD storage and 32GB RAM just dropped to an all-time low of $909, slashed from its typical $3,399 price tag</a>. The <strong>73% discount puts enterprise-level computing power within reach of anyone</strong> who needs serious performance without the four-figure price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5461/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Professional Power at Consumer Pricing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-1355U processor brings 10 cores to the table and splits the workload between performance and efficiency cores. This implies that while the efficiency cores handle background applications to save battery, this laptop churns out demanding tasks like compiling code or rendering videos with the performance cores. You can run multiple virtual machines for development work, edit RAW photo files in Lightroom or keep 30 browser tabs open while video conferencing without the system choking.</p>



<p>The 32GB of RAM changes the way you interact with memory-intensive applications: You can load entire databases into memory for faster queries, run multiple Docker containers side by side, or edit 4K video timelines without pre-rendering proxies. This much memory means Chrome won’t slow down when you have research tabs from last week still open and switching between applications happens instantaneously rather than waiting for things to load from disk.</p>



<p>Storage capacity reaches 1TB through NVMe SSD and gives you <strong>read speeds of about 3,500 MB/s and write speeds of about 3,000 MB/s</strong>. These are speeds whereby Windows boots in a number of seconds, applications launch in an instant, and even big file transfers complete before you’ve finished your coffee.</p>
<p>This <strong>15.6-inch FHD runs at a 120Hz refresh rate</strong> which makes scrolling through documents and websites noticeably smoother compared to most 60Hz screens. Text is sharper during rapid scrolling, while the anti-glare coating cuts down on eye strain during long sessions under fluorescent office lights or near windows. The higher refresh rate also serves well in casual gaming during breaks and lends even older games a more responsive feel.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro includes several features</strong> that people with Home versions don’t get including BitLocker encryption to protect sensitive files, Remote Desktop for accessing your machine from anywhere, and Hyper-V for running virtual machines. The fingerprint reader is integrated with Windows Hello which means you only need a touch to log in instead of having to type passwords.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>battery life supports a full workday away from outlets</strong>&nbsp;and the rapid charging brings you back to 50 percent capacity in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $909 for specs that would normally cost upwards of $3,000, this Dell laptop provides professional computing power at a fraction of the price.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix is releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 next February.</p>
<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play broadcast</a> earlier on, the team behind this reimagined release shared a new "follow-up trailer", briefly highlighting the journey ahead for the party of heroes. Fans also got a glimpse of - <strong>spoiler alert</strong> - an older-looking Kiefer, who you'll be reunited with on your adventures.</p>
<p>Here's the official description about Kiefer's return:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the core elements from the original remain, #DragonQuest VII Reimagined offers streamlined progression, fuller character development, and new storylines...</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You'll run into an older looking Kiefer during your adventure to the Rucker region of the past. Your party will sneak into Rucker Castle at night to help him. Don't let the guards spot you! If they do, don't worry — Kiefer has honed his skills and will support you in battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll get to fight alongside Kiefer again elsewhere...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the release of this trailer, Square Enix has also <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1988389037942640860">gone into a bit more detail</a> about the additional content and new locations in the game. To unlock these areas, you'll need to collect "fragments of broken stone tablets, fit them together, and place them on a pedestal of the same color".</p>
<p>You'll do this at The Shrine of Mysteries, which is located on the island your party calls home. Each stone tablet will lead to a different location with its own problems to solve. As you help out locals, you'll transform the world, with new islands appearing out of nowhere.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-clearing-out-2025-laptops-hp%E2%80%99s-14-inch-ai-model-drops-to-pennies-65-off.1350637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people don’t have $2,000 sitting around for a MacBook and frankly, you might not even need that kind of firepower for everyday computing. HP’s 14-inch AI <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/">2025 laptop just hit an all-time low of $379 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,099 price tag</a>. The kicker is that <strong>Windows 11 Pro and a year of Office 365 come pre-installed</strong>, and those two software packages alone would normally cost you close to what you’re paying for the entire laptop at this discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Budget Pricing Meets Modern Computing Power</h2>
<p>The Intel N150 processor keeps things running smoothly whether you’re browsing the web, editing documents or streaming videos without the lag that’s so common in cheaper laptops. This chip isn’t going to render 4K video projects in seconds but it launches apps quickly and handles multiple browser tabs without grinding to a halt. You get responsive performance during video calls and enough processing muscle to run Office applications alongside your email and a dozen Chrome tabs.</p>
<p>This laptop features 16GB of DDR4 RAM which makes a big difference when you’re jumping between applications: you can have email open and edit a presentation while streaming music in the background, running antivirus scans, without everything slowing to a crawl. It really means that <strong>Windows 11 runs the way Microsoft intended it to</strong> with smooth transitions and instant app switching.</p>



<p>The <strong>storage setup combines 128GB of universal flash storage with a 256GB microSD card</strong> for a total of 386GB. The UFS storage handles your operating system and most used programs quickly thanks to its high read and write speeds, while the microSD card is there for documents, photos, and media files. In this way, this two-storage solution will keep your system running fast and gives you space for thousands of documents.</p>
<p>Unlike the Home edition, <strong>Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise-level security features</strong> and offers remote desktop capabilities. The Pro version lets you encrypt your hard drive with BitLocker, join corporate domains, and access your computer remotely when you’re traveling. You’ll also get Office 365, which gives you the full Microsoft productivity suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive cloud storage, right out of the box. That <strong>subscription generally costs $99 per year alone, while Windows 11 Pro typically adds $199 to a laptop’s sticker price so you’re basically getting the hardware for $80</strong> after accounting for the software value.</p>



<p>A dedicated <strong>AI key for Copilot puts Microsoft’s AI Assistant</strong> just a button-press away. You can ask it to draft emails for you, summarize long documents, generate creative content, and even give tips for troubleshooting without opening a browser or digging through menus. This integration speeds up the workflow when you need fast answers or want to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>The Sky Blue finish adds some nice personality to what’s otherwise a sea of gray and black finishes in the market. It also saves you from having to buy peripherals separately because it includes a Redragon mouse, and it is remarkably lightweight, easy to carry from home to office or coffee shop. You get a full computing package with the $379 asking price, capable of handling daily productivity tasks, coming loaded with premium software and even putting in modern features like AI integration and Wi-Fi 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#885)—Clues and Answers for Wednesday, November 12]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-12-885/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-885-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-12.1350634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re at the midway point of the week and raring to go with another NYT Connections puzzle. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll need to smash today’s challenge. How’s your week going? Let me know in the comments if you’ve been playing any other puzzling games and what you might like to see more hints for!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections answers you’re looking for. Today’s puzzle is a little bizarre as it features <strong>exclusively </strong>four-letter words. You’ll see what I mean below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-12">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 12)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #885:</p>



<ul>
<li>YOLO</li>



<li>POLO</li>



<li>LOCO</li>



<li>DODO</li>



<li>COMO</li>



<li>FOMO</li>



<li>JUDO</li>



<li>BOGO</li>



<li>BOZO</li>



<li>ROJO</li>



<li>YO-YO</li>



<li>SUMO</li>



<li>POCO</li>



<li>DOPE</li>



<li>GOLF</li>



<li>GOAT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>These all involve physical competition, but not your everyday gym workout.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Terms for someone who’s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>Internet-born abbreviations that pack a punch.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>You might hear these in Madrid or Mexico City.</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 12.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-12-885">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 12 (#885)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GOLF, JUDO, POLO, SUMO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOZO, DODO, DOPE, YO-YO</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOGO, FOMO, GOAT, YOLO</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMO, LOCO, POCO, ROJO</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sony is taking a page out of Nintendo's book with its console variations. Just like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/">Nintendo released a Japanese-language-only variation of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a version of the console that is only sold in Japan and only has Japanese as an available language on the device, Sony is doing the same with a new Japanese-language-only digital PS5 console. Also, just like the Japan-only variant of the Switch 2, it's slightly cheaper than getting the standard version.</p>



<p>You could argue that it was an odd choice by Sony to end its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event</a> with not a new game reveal or announcement, but the reveal of a Japan-only PS5 console, but you can't really act surprised since the whole event was meant for the Japanese consumer. From that angle, it makes perfect sense to try persuading anyone who hasn't bought in on the PS5 yet in Japan with a new, cheaper version they can run out and buy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, a standard digital PS5 in Japan costs ¥72,980 ($475), though this new regional variant will drop the price to ¥55,000 ($355), which is more than a solid discount. But that's still more expensive than what the price of the console when it launched in 2020, which was ¥39,980 ($260). This new price is actually a bit of a middle ground compared to where the price of the console was at launch, and where it is now after two price increases.</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the world, players in Japan who have not yet bought a PS5 are going to get the best deal currently available, since $355 USD is significantly cheaper than the price of the console elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Sony brings this same tactic to the PS5 Pro, to extend the reach of its higher-end model. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-quietly-offloads-obi-wan-kenobis-starfighter-now-selling-for-pocket-change-on-amazon-2000643056</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s Star Wars line is the brick giant’s most popualr franchise but the company rarely discounts these sets on its own website. Amazon just changed the game by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/">Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Jedi Starfighter to an all-time low of $25, down from its regular $29 price tag</a>. This <strong>282-piece set</strong> from <em>Attack of the Clones</em> gives you the iconic blue starfighter, three minifigures including a debut character and enough playability to keep young Jedi entertained for hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>A Starfighter That Delivers on All Fronts</h2>
<p>The build itself captures the <strong>sleek design of Obi-Wan’s Delta-7 Aethersprite-class interceptor</strong> impressively well considering the compact size. You get retractable landing gear that actually works, and gives kids the satisfaction of transforming the ship from flight mode to landed position via a simple mechanism. The cockpit opens smoothly to fit the <strong>Obi-Wan minifigure</strong>, complete with <strong>his blue lightsaber</strong> that stores in dedicated clips on the exterior when he’s flying. Two stud shooters mounted on the wings let you recreate those intense space battles from the Geonosis sequence, and fires with enough force to knock over other LEGO creations without being dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>R4-P17, Obi-Wan’s faithful astromech droid</strong>, gets a special attachment point on the wing where you can place the head of the droid. This detail mirrors how the droid integrates directly into the starfighter in the movies and provides navigation and repair capabilities during missions. The Taun We minifigure marks her first appearance in any LEGO set, which matters to collectors who track these releases. She’s the <strong>Kaminoan</strong> who greets Obi-Wan at the cloning facility and her inclusion adds a narrative element beyond just the starfighter itself.</p>



<p>The finished model <strong>measures 10 inches long, 5 inches wide, and just over 2.5 inches tall</strong>, which makes it substantial enough to display on a shelf without taking up half your bookcase. The proportions work well for swooshing around during play sessions, and construction feels solid enough to survive typical handling from seven-year-olds. LEGO designed this set with a balance between structural integrity and the ability to actually play with it rather than creating a fragile display piece that falls apart if you look at it wrong.</p>
<p>At 282 pieces, you’re looking at<strong> roughly an hour or two of building time</strong> depending on experience level. The instruction booklet breaks everything down into clear steps with color-coded sections so younger builders won’t get frustrated trying to figure out which tiny piece goes where. This piece count hits the sweet spot where it’s engaging enough to feel like an accomplishment but not so overwhelming that kids lose interest halfway through.</p>
<p>The $25 price works out to less than nine cents per piece so this is a pretty comfortable margin below the average LEGO price. Star Wars sets are typically a bit more expensive than average because of the licensing fees, so it’s not common to find one below the usual retail price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-that%E2%80%99s-only-for-japan.1350604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During Tuesday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049">Japan-focused State of Play</a>, Sony announced a new, cheaper Japanese-language-only PlayStation 5 Digital Edition console that will be available exclusively in Japan. It’s likely a reaction to tariffs in the United States, inflation in Japan, and Nintendo’s own cheaper Japan-only Switch 2.</p>

 <p>On November 11, at the very end of PlayStation’s latest State of Play broadcast, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino announced “something very special” for gamers in Japan: A Japanese-language-only PS5 console that will cost ¥55,000 yen, which is roughly $350 USD. That same console, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">following a price increase earlier this year</a>, now costs $500 in the United States. Currently, the digital-only PS5 in Japan costs roughly ¥73,000. So if you live in Japan and know the language, you can save quite a bit of money buying this<a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/"> cheaper, Japanese-only version of the PS5, which goes on sale on November 21</a>.</p>   <p>As to why Sony is releasing a cheaper, Japan-only PS5, there are a few factors. One of the big ones, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6edb22a-0b19-4073-9e28-ec29b096dde3">as reported by the <em>Financial Times,</em></a> is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/07/japanese-real-wages-takaichi-abenomics-inflation-boj-policy.html">rising inflation and the yen losing value</a> in Sony’s home country. And since, as Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">told <em>VGC</em></a>, many gamers in Japan don’t care about their consoles being region-locked or restricted to Japanese only, this is a way for Sony to offer a cheaper console to one of its key markets.</p>

 <p>It also makes it harder for resellers and people outside of Japan to snatch up PS5 consoles at a cheaper price, a factor that led to Nintendo offering its very own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-made-a-much-cheaper-japanese-language-only-nintendo-switch-2-and-even-duolingo-is-poking-fun">Japan-only Switch 2 console earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s another likely reason for a Japan-only PS5: <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466071/ps5-outsells-switch-2-ps5-tops-80m-worldwide-hardware-estimates-for-september-2025/#:~:text=by%20over%2051%2C000.-,2025%20year%2Dto%2Ddate%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20has%20sold%209.24%20million%20units%2C%20the%20PlayStation%205%20has%20sold%20an%20estimated%208.21%20million%20units%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%201%20has%20sold%203.31%20million%20units%2C%20and%20the%20Xbox%20Series%20X%7CS%20has%20sold%201.69%20million%20units.,-Monthly%20Sales%3A">The Switch 2 is doing very well in the country</a>, and the OG Switch is holding its own, too. Sony’s pricey PS5 is likely too much for consumers in Japan who are struggling with inflation. A cheaper, <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/">region-locked PS5</a> that can’t be easily resold on the grey market could be a big hit in Japan and help Sony regain some ground. It also marks Sony’s first region-locked console since the PlayStation 2.</p> <p>Of course, one more factor in all of this is the ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. These tariffs led to Sony raising the price of all PS5 consoles in the United States earlier this year, and a Japan-only PS5 can help the company focus on its local market without having to pay high tariffs or deal with outside buyers. Who had “Region-Locked Consoles Return In 2025” on their horrible bingo card?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign is getting its first meaty, proper, named DLC next month, including new bosses, new shifting earth, and new playable Nightfarers. The DLC is called The Forsaken Hollows, and it's out on December 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a trailer shown during today's State of Play, which showed off a lot of clips from what's to come, albeit without a lot of context. There's a clip showing what seems to be a new Shifting Earth known as The Great Hollow, which opens up a huge hole in the middle of Limveld with temples, towers, and crystals sticking out. We see two new Nightfarers: the first is the Undertaker, which uses strength and faith as her primary stats, and the Scholar, which seems to be an arcane-focused magic-user.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also two new bosses that should be familiar to FromSoft veterans. Most notable is a glimpse of Artorias, subject of the original Dark Souls DLC Artorias of the Abyss.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A voiceover that sounds a lot like Duchess also refers to "the aftermath of the Long Night," perhaps implying that this DLC takes place after the "end" of Nightreign when the Nightfarers have defeated all the Nightlords. There's also something at the beginning about the "Dreglord". As usual, Souls fans will probably have to wait for the post-release lore videos to make sense of this one. It's unclear how much story content this is really going to add, or if it's just the bosses, the characters, and the shifting earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign is Bandai Namco's multiplayer riff on Elden Ring, where 1-3 players can fight their way through three nights of exploration, loot hunting, and bosses as they try to take down powerful Night Lords. The game launched back in May, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">we gave it a 7/10</a>, saying "When Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its release, FromSoftware has made a number of balance tweaks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">added a duos mode</a>, and updated with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-an-update-and-one-last-tease-for-us-before-elden-ring-nightreigns-challenging-deep-of-night-mode-arrives-check-out-the-patch-notes">an ultra-hard difficulty mode called Deep of Night</a> for those who for some reason didn't think the game was hard enough as-is. However, the last few months have been quiet, and fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-by-end-of-march-2026-as-frustrated-players-leave-negative-steam-reviews">grown agitated at the lack of news or updates</a>, with FromSoftware leaving them to just fight the same bosses over and over. FromSoftware moved to reassure everyone just yesterday in a financial report, and today's DLC announcement should help matters as well.

        <blockquote><p><em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> is a full remake of the second installment in the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> (<em>PROJECT ZERO</em>) series, originally released in 2003. The title has undergone a complete overhaul to offer a haunting experience, which has been beautifully reborn thanks to enhanced graphics, sound and controls elements.</p><p>The graphical enhancements offer a higher level of detail with refined textures, striking lighting and shadow contrast, generating a more haunting and realistic atmosphere than ever before. The sound has been revamped to offer spatial audio that will immerse players deep into the <a title="Genres > Action [3,188 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, allowing them to enjoy a more authentic experience. Not only will they hear and feel the presence of spirits more intensely, but wraiths will appear when least expected, such as trying to grab the protagonist’s hands when reaching for an item or waiting in the shadows. Players will have to react quickly to escape these attacks. Failure to do so will inflict Willpower Damage, leading directly to intense combat.</p><p>The gameplay mechanics of the Camera Obscura, a signature feature of the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> franchise, have also been reworked to offer a more intense and rich experience during combat and exploration. Players will still be able to attack wraiths by taking photos, but managing to align the focus point with their target will inflict more damage. If the damage dealt exceeds a certain threshold, players will be able to activate Shutter Chance state, where they will then be able to deal significant damage with one single picture within a brief period—making it crucial for fans to be precise and to perfectly time their shot.</p><p>Players will be able to trigger a Fatal Frame by taking a shot at the perfect moment, which will interrupt and stun their opponent. If fans manage to trigger a Fatal Frame during a Shutter Chance state, they will activate a Fatal Time, a limited window that will allow them to take several shots in quick succession to inflict significant damage.</p><p>To confront the spirits lurking in the shadows of Minakami Village, players will be able to rely on new Camera Obscura features such as focus, zoom and filters. By lighting up the focus points on the screen, players will focus on their target and deal more damage to the spirits if they manage to light more focus points. By using the zoom feature, players will be able to attack a spirit from a distance while taking cover and being undetected and will also be able to attack multiple targets at once by zooming out. The zoom of the Camera Obscura will also help players during exploration as they will be able to photograph specific objects.</p><p>Lastly, the filters will help players to unravel the mysteries around them by changing filters depending on the situation or wraith they encounter. Among the different filters they can use, the Paraceptual Filter will allow them to increase their shooting distance in combat and, when exploring, to reproduce past actions using the residual memories.</p><p>In addition to these new mechanics, <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> will introduce new gameplay features, such as being able to hold Mayu’s hand, which will recover players’ Health and Willpower. However, if Mayu is in danger, she may stumble and fall, requiring Mio’s help to get back up. Players will also be able to collect Charms they can equip, allowing them to benefit from various effects. By expanding the Charm Bag, the number of charms they can equip will increase.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Considering it comes with 768 pieces, the Horizon Adventures set was already a bargain at full price compared to many licensed Lego sets.</p><p>The buildable Machines are larger than you might expect, too. Sawtooth, for example, is 7 x 4.5 x 3 inches. Both Machines have numerous points of articulation to create different poses or to play with them like action figures. You can turn Sawtooth's neck, head, legs, and hips as well as open his jaws on both sides. Meanwhile, the Shell-Walker Machine has adjustable legs and claws. Shell-Walker also has detachable cargo pod and shield accessories.</p><p>Aloy wields her signature bow, while Varl has his spear. Each weapon can be modded with accessories representing elemental attacks--fire, chill, and shock--from the game. The playset also includes two small baseplates with miniature builds of tall reeds, a treasure chest, and a campfire.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4600796-legohorizonadventures.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4600796-legohorizonadventures.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600796"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures (77037)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4600796-legohorizonadventures.jpg"></figure><p>Aloy &amp; Varl vs. Shell-Walker &amp; Sawtooth isn't the first Lego set based on PlayStation's Horizon franchise. In 2022, Lego designed an awesome <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Forbidden-West-Collectible/dp/B09Q46YHKB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1,222-piece Tallneck</a> based on the Machine's appearance in Horizon Forbidden West.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Tallneck was discontinued by Lego at the end of 2023. It was still possible to find the Tallneck at Amazon last year, but the retailer sold out over the holidays due to a Black Friday discount. Reseller prices have risen throughout 2025; sellers on Amazon's marketplace are currently asking $160 for the Tallneck. At face value, this price may sound too outlandish for a large Lego model designed for adults, but the Tallneck originally retailed for $90. Despite the inflated cost, Amazon's store page notes 100-plus units sold over the last 30 days.</p><hr><p>If you haven't played the Lego Horizon Adventures video game, physical editions for PS5 and Nintendo Switch are available for low prices at multiple retailers.</p><ul><li><strong>Lego Horizon Adventures for PS5</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+A+Rare+Discount+On+Lego%27s+768-Piece+Horizon+Adventures+Battle+Set&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-11+16%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-11+16%3A02%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536132&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Flego-horizon-adventures-2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fplaystation-lego-horizon-adventures-aloy-and-varl-shell-walker-and-sawtooth-building-set%2F1100-6536132%2F%3Fcomment_page%3D1&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Woot</a> -- $22 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Adventures-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B09Z7JZW4P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> -- $31.49 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lego Horizon Adventures for Switch</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Adventures-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DJDLS8Q1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> -- $26.86 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+A+Rare+Discount+On+Lego%27s+768-Piece+Horizon+Adventures+Battle+Set&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-11+16%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-11+16%3A02%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536132&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Horizon-Adventures-Nintendo-Switch%2F12805502400%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fplaystation-lego-horizon-adventures-aloy-and-varl-shell-walker-and-sawtooth-building-set%2F1100-6536132%2F%3Fcomment_page%3D1&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> -- $26.87 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul></li></ul><div title="6536132 - Horizon Aloy and Varl Action Figures" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4951" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536132 - Horizon Aloy and Varl Action Figures" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies\/dp\/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Horizon Forbidden West: 10-Inch Aloy Plush</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies\/dp\/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$6 (was $20)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PlayStation Shapes Collection also includes a 10-inch Aloy plush.
