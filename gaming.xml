            <p>If you've tried to pay for something on Steam via PayPal over the past month and a bit, only to be told you can't, Valve have now offered an explanation as to why, pointing to a bank that previously handled PayPal transactions in certain currencies as having suddenly terminated its support.</p>
<p>Folks in affected countries first noticed notifications informing them PayPal was "currently unavailable" in their part of the world <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1lxtux9/paypal_temporarily_disabled_since/">around a month ago</a>. There's been a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m15oki/why/">steady</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m67k41/is_anyone_else_having_trouble_paying_with_paypal/">stream</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mjto06/paypal_no_longer_available_in_the_philippines/">Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m9pi7t/so_paypal_stopped_working_on_steam_in_all_of/">posts</a> from folks who've gotten to checkout and been told this since then.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While those examples didn't see Valve offer any further explanation of what was up, a player has now been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">directed to one</a>, with the same message having been added to Steam's <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp">support page for purchasing issues</a>.</p>
<p>"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam," Valve wrote. "This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD." Hence folks in nations that don't use euros, pounds, yen, or dollars of the Canadian / American / Australian variety being unable to buy Steam's wares via PayPal.</p><p>"We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain," Valve continued. "We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this. In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a Steam Wallet code to add funds to your account."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve and PayPal for comment.</p>
<p>As of writing, it's unclear whether this is related to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">Valve's recent policy changes</a> regarding adult content on Steam, which they claim were in response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-point-to-mastercard-restrictions-as-the-payment-firm-deny-influencing-adult-game-removals">pressure from payment processors</a> and other financial parties like acquiring banks (who themselves look to have been pressured by anti-porn campaign group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">Collective Shout</a>) last month. It might be unrelated: while Valve have only offered the vague window of "early July" as the point when PayPal began backing out, the earliest Reddit post I've found from someone affected is dated <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1lxtux9/paypal_temporarily_disabled_since/">July 12</a>, which looks to pre-date the adult games/payment processor drama kicking off by at least <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">a few days</a>.</p>
<p>At least now folks aren't left wondering if this is just a temporary outage and/or routine maintenance. Hopefully Valve can find a way to at least offer those using affected currencies more alternative options when they push their cart full of Euro Truck Sim DLC and... other stuff that's not Euro Truck Sim DLC to the till.</p>

This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voiceovers, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026," the statement concluded. "However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge flood of gaming news is on the horizon with Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 right around the corner. For all the details you need, look no further than our guide.</p>



<p>The latter months of 2025 have been blown wide open following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-gta-6-delayed-release-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s delay</a> until next year, with plenty of new release dates expected to be announced during Opening Night Live. While not all will release this year, it should pack the schedule with a load to be excited about.</p>



<p>To make sure you don’t miss out on any of the fun, use our dedicated guide for a breakdown of all the important information. </p>







<figure><figcaption>Lock in. Image via Gamescom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on Tuesday, August 19. As the name suggests, it marks the start of the entire Gamescom event.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a variety of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several playable titles, ranging from Hollow Knight: Silksong to Borderlands 4, and online showcases from Xbox, Bethesda, and the Future Games Show.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 takes place at 11am PT/1pm CT/2pm ET/7pm BST/4am AST (August 20).</strong></p>



<p>The showcase is expected to start bang on time, with no initial countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in and ready. If you do miss any of the announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all of the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the times in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">13:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">14:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">04:00 (Aug. 2)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 will be available to watch directly on both YouTube and Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow live streams such as this due to the fact that it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom.global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. So, if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly advise watching through Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform suits you, though, and remember to keep your eyes peeled to Insider Gaming for all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>



<p>You can also watch ONL through the <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom</a> website, while clips and trailers will likely be posted on TikTok.</p>







<p><span><b>Gamescom ON</b></span><strong>L</strong><span><b> 2025 takes place in Cologne, Germany, the home of </b>Gamescom<b>. Specifically, it’s at Hall 1 of the Koelnmesse.</b></span></p>



<p>A live audience is in attendance, with the event ticketed as part of the Gamescom event itself, with fans, media, and streamers in attendance to react to the latest news and reveals. Those with a ticket are advised to arrive by 6pm, with admission closing half an hour before the start.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom ONL is expected to have a runtime of two hours, as shown by the events schedule on the official website.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to Summer Games Fest and the Game Awards, Geoff Keighley will host the event filled with new game announcements, trailers, gameplay reveals, and special guests. </p>

            <p>There were plenty of exciting announcements in last night’s VR Games Showcase but one of the games that really caught my attention was the VR port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lushfoil-photography-sim">Lushfoil Photography Sim</a> from</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> and Matt Newell. Described by Donlan in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lushfoil-photography-sim-review">Lushfoil review</a> as minimalist and luxurious, Lushfoil Photography Sim looks pretty as a picture and, played in VR, it could scratch that same, relaxing, photorealistic (pun not intended) itch as Kayak VR: Mirage.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below for a look at the game in action in VR, although you'll obviously only get the true experience when you're wearing the headset.</p>

<p>At the moment the VR version of Lushfoil is only confirmed for PC via Steam VR. Lushfoil also released on PS5, so it's not impossible we'll see it ported to PS VR2 in the future. If Annapurna Interactive makes an announcement on this in the coming months we'll let you know. No firm release date for the PC VR version of Lushfoil has been announced, but it's coming soon.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publishers Krafton have issued their response to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">lawsuit filed against them</a> by the game's former lead developers. If you're wondering whether things have cooled off a bit between the two parties now we're in Saul Goodmanville, think again, because the second paragraph of the response sees Krafton accuse the leads of having "resorted to litigation to demand a payday they haven't earned."</p>
<p>It's an almost impossible task at this point to sum up the Subnautica 2 saga in less than a War and Peace length novel, but here's my attempt to give you the abbreviated version. Krafton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delay the game from a 2025 early access release to 2026</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">fire three leads on it</a>: Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill. The company accuse those leads of abandoning their duties and argue the game wasn't ready for early access. The leads disagree and file a lawsuit. A big part of what makes the disagreement so noteworthy is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">a $250 million bonus</a> to be paid to Unknown Worlds staff if the game hit certain targets by the end of 2025, which Krafton have now said they'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">still pay out a fraction of</a>. Annnnddd breathe.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That takes us up to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">this response</a> from Krafton to the three ousted devs' lawsuit. In it, the company argues that "rather than investing the effort necessary" to meet the conditions for earning their bit of the bonus, the trio are merely attempting to extract that cash through legal action.</p>
<p>The not-putting-in-the-effort part leads onto the publishers once again arguing their view that the trio "quickly lost interest" in developing Subnautica 2 after Krafton bought Unknown Worlds in a $500 million deal, and promised that additional $250 million payout linked to Subnautica 2's success. Cleveland and McGuire, the response says, went off to do other stuff, while Gill is claimed to have "focused on leveraging his operational control to maximise the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game." The game's design director is cited as having said the former two leads were "checked out."</p><p>Krafton go on to suggest that problems with Subnautica 2 were revealed via a March 2024 internal assessment, but rather than working to improve it, the leads "blamed others and overhauled the team" and "continued to reduce the scope of the game." Roll forwards to breaking point. Krafton then claim that they were concerned releasing Subnautica 2 into early access in an undercooked state could cause "irreversible harm" to the series' name and future potential, pointing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> as an example of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-early-access-review">such reputational damage</a>.</p>
<p>Krafton pushed for the delay, and allege the three leads not only opposed that move, but said they would self-publish the game. The company also claim the trio "secretly downloaded massive amounts of confidential information" from Unknown Worlds. Basically, Krafton's view is that Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill only cared about getting that $250 million payout, and were prepared to put out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-delay-actually-proves-krafton-arent-mismanaging-their-games-says-exec">whatever version of the game they had</a> on time to get it. Or, as the publishers put it:</p>
<blockquote>The Key Employees' insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout. At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding 'a timeline that doesn't tank the earnout opportunity' and scheduling the release to maximize their payments. Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the [Key Employees'] focus was on their payday, and not on the game.</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the response sees Krafton provide direct rebuttals to different elements of the ex-leads' lawsuit, but as you can see here, despite all the Lionel Hutz language, punches are very much not being pulled whatsoever in this legal drama. We'll have to see if Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill issue any response, but otherwise we're likely into the part where all the lawyers get to work lawyering:a back-and-forth that could lead to court proceedings if both parties can't come to an arrangement before then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following a successful early access launch on PC, inZoi’s unique brand of life-sim gameplay is set to arrive on PS5 in 2026. It looks to include upcoming DLC and should be fully optimized for the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-inzoi-money-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inZoi</a> was heralded as a rival to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-reiterates-plans-for-the-sims-4-multiplayer-the-sims-5-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a>—in case you’ve forgotten, it’s the game that initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let you run over children</a>. With EA’s series into the hundreds of millions in terms of copies sold, there’s a lot of catching up to do. inZoi achieved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-1-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million copies sold</a> within its first week.</p>



<p>Numbers have dropped off since, but this is to be expected. A PS5 release could be what inZoi needs to get back into the picture.</p>



<h2 id="h-could-inzoi-rival-the-sims-domination">Could inZoi Rival The Sims’ Domination?</h2>

<p>In a press release, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Krafton</a> declared: “inZOI, its immersive life simulation game, will launch on PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2026. The PS5 version will be fully optimized for console, bringing players the same robust gameplay experience featured on PC.”</p>



<p>The port features “All of the key systems and features that define the PC experience, reworked for console controls and performance to ensure a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Running over children was eventually declared a bug</a>, so don’t expect to do that on PS5. However, the first major DLC expansion is on the way in 2025—Island Getaway. I’d expect this to come with the PS5 launch, but it remains to be seen if it’s free.</p>



<p>Have you played inZoi on PC? Is there any potential at all for it to challenge The Sims, or other life-sim legends like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing? You know the place to let us know—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 Season 4 is well underway in Fortnite, with a bunch of new Weekly Quests to complete, and locating Shadow Briefings is required if you want to net a handy boost for your Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Shadow Briefings are not new in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=Fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, instead being guaranteed in pretty much every chapter and season that features, but the spawn locations can vary. As such, it can be difficult to track them down in times of need.</p>



<p>We’re here to make things easier, however, by pointing you in the direction of all the Shadow Briefings locations in Chapter 6, Season 4. We’ve also included our tips on the best landing spots to help you complete the quest.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4">Fortnite Shadow Briefings Locations in Chapter 6 Season 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pick your spot. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Shadow Briefings spawn randomly at the start of each game, though they do have set spawns—which we’ve highlighted on the map above.</strong></p>



<p>Given the spawns are random, there are no guaranteed spots where you can secure Shadow Briefings. However, as the map shows, some areas are better than others, with a few potential spawns in close proximity. </p>



<p>The best spots I’ve found are:</p>



<ul>
<li>South of the Burd To Go in the northwest of the map.</li>



<li>The Resistance Base in the northeast of the map.</li>



<li>O.X.R HQ in the mid-west of the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>Heading to these locations is a great starting point in your hunt, given the potential spawns nearby. They also offer a decent haul of loot, so you will be well prepared if you encounter enemy players.</p>



<p>It may still take a few matches to tick off the quest entirely, however, but with these locations at your disposal, it won’t take too much time to knock out. You can also revisit the same spot if you enter a different match. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-amp-accept-shadow-briefings-in-fortnite">How to Find &amp; Accept Shadow Briefings in Fortnite</h2>



<p><strong>As you approach a Shadow Briefing spawn in Fortnite, a white laptop will appear on your map marking the location.</strong></p>



<p>To complete the weekly quest, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to one of the locations on the map above to find a Shadow Briefing.</li>



<li>Approach the briefcase and interact with it to accept a mission.</li>



<li>Complete this step three times to tick off the Weekly Quest.</li>
</ol>



<p>As the Weekly Quest only tells you to find and accept Shadow Briefings, you don’t need to complete the missions they provide. However, if you do, you can net yourself some decent loot and some additional experience.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> hasn't been flush with new releases, I think it's fair to say, but Nintendo has offered up a nice lot of games in its Nintendo Classics games portal. The next GameCube game to arrive has been revealed, and it's the wonderful Chibi-Robo!</p>
<p>Classic GameCube games are an exclusive feature of the Nintendo Switch 2 and are only available to players who have the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Chibi-Robo! joins a line-up that already includes the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Super Mario Strikers, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with Chibi-Robo, Nintendo has released a trailer for the Nintendo Classic release which you can watch below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-coming-to-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration.1268739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (an internal developer of Krafton) <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1955436672444928385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that their namesake game will be released <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a> in early 2026, while an Xbox port is still under consideration:</p>



<p><em>We‘re excited to announce that inZOI is scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 (PS5) in 2026.</em> <em>Our team is working hard to bring you the best possible experience on PS5. (An Xbox release is also under consideration, but not yet confirmed.) The official release date and additional details will be shared at a later time.</em></p>



<p>inZOI is a life simulation game that debuted on Steam Early Access on March 28. It had a lot of hype going for it, as it proved when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller just one week after launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mixed', with only 47% of the 618 reviews left in the last month giving it a thumbs up. Some fans believe that inZOI needs a lot more content and features before it can launch out of early access. </p>



<p>Given the projected early 2026 PS5 launch and the fact that early access games do not generally debut before version 1.0 on Sony's console, it's a fair assumption that the developers are sticking to their original one-year early access phase. The 1.0 release on PC and PS5 could therefore be internally scheduled for March 2026, though of course, the team should do well to heed the community's concerns and possibly delay the full launch if it serves the purpose of addressing their feedback and delivering a better final product.</p>



<p>In June, inZOI also <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-gets-official-modkit-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received an official Modkit update</a> that allows users to craft and share user-generated content (UGC) with a specific tool available for free via the Epic Games Store. It is unclear whether that will be available on PlayStation 5; consoles are usually more restrictive in this area.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 already boasts over 600,000 pre-order sales on Steam and has a whopping wishlist total of 2.7m, according to new data.</p>



<p>The EA title is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of the year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a million players</a> jumping in during the first Open Beta weekend. The Battlefield 6 Open Beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/">return</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/"> this weekend</a> and could hit similar numbers, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and modes being added.</a></p>



<p>While Open Beta numbers don’t necessarily guarantee success, it appears the stars are aligning for EA with Battlefield 6 as the pre-order sales and wishlists on Steam suggest the community is ready to purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-eye-watering-pre-order-data">Battlefield 6’s Eye-Watering Pre-Order Data</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Impressive. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a>, over 600,000 pre-orders have been placed for Battlefield 6 on Steam, while a whopping 2.7m players have added the title to their Steam wishlist.</p>



<p>The data adds that this translates to revenues of around $35m on Steam alone, with Battlefield 6 sitting at number two last week for revenues on Steam and number three for totalsales. Of course, this only equates to one platform, too.</p>



<p>Battlefield’s 6 impressive numbers have been rising for a while, however, taking just a few days to surge past the 500,000 wishlist mark when the game was added to Steam last month, including a staggering period from July 25 to 30 with between 95,000 and 150,000 players adding the game to their wishlists each day.</p>



<p>Those numbers put Battlefield 6 in sixth position in Steam’s top wishlisted games, behind only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, Light No Fire, and ARC Raiders. </p>

            <p>Popular life sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, already released on PC, has been confirmed for release on PlayStation 5 during the first half of 2026. While PS5 players keen for more life sim options are in luck, Xbox owners need to wait to see if the game will arrive on their consoles. Publisher Krafton has stated that an Xbox release of InZoi is "under consideration."</p>
<p>For console players worried about how InZoi will work outside of the PC space, Krafton has stated that the console version will be full-featured and be optimised for consoles. Given the game is some way from release we'll need to be patient to see if these claims are backed up.</p>
<p>InZoi raced to 1 million players on PC within one week of the game's release on Steam in March.</p>
<p>Aside from announcing plans to consider the game for Xbox, InZoi is also releasing on Mac on 20th August. On Mac players will need Apple silicon Macs with an M2 chip or newer and 16GB or more of unified memory.</p>
<p>We felt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">InZoi had potential</a> to be a big player in the life sim market when we played the game back at release, although it was far from the complete package.</p>

<p>Grounded 2 has surged past the three million player mark just a few weeks into its early access lifespan, it has been revealed.</p>



<p>The Obsidian Games title, a sequel to the initial game that was fully released in September 2022, has capitalized on the popularity of the franchise to set impressive numbers.</p>



<p>Most impressive, however, is that this is still extremely early on in Grounded 2’s lifespan, with a full release not officially set and plenty to come in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grounded-2-roadmap-2025-2026-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>, so the signs are certainly promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-grounded-2-s-impressive-numbers">Grounded 2’s Impressive Numbers</h2>

<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1955458077597348194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Microsoft’s vice president of games marketing, Aaron Greenberg, revealed the latest numbers from Grounded 2, with over three million jumping in.</p>



<p>These numbers cover only those on Xbox Series X|S and PC, via Steam or the Xbox App, with Grounded 2 yet to be released on any other platforms, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grounded-2-coming-to-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grounded-2-on-playstation-xbox-or-switch-all-grounded-2-platforms-consoles-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>



<p>That means there is still ample opportunity for further boosts to the Grounded 2 player base, especially when you factor in updates including new tools, rideable bugs, and bosses.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 has already massively surpassed the original title on Steam, with a concurrent record of just shy of 50,000 set after launch, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. In comparison, the highest concurrent player peak for the initial title is just over 32,000, set in 2021.</p>



<p>All in all, it’s very encouraging signs for the future of Grounded 2 and the franchise overall, with plenty more surges expected in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, during its <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss.php?c=pearlabyss&amp;y=2979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 fiscal year 2025 presentation</a>, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the delay of Crimson Desert. The upcoming action/adventure game was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in Q4 2025</a>, but it has been pushed back one quarter, as the Pearl Abyss CEO revealed:</p>



<p><em>Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voice-overs while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</em></p>



<p><em>The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</em></p>



<p><em>The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week.</em></p>



<p>Unfortunate news for anyone looking to play Crimson Desert this year, to be sure, but no doubt the final version will benefit from a little bit more polish. Besides, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to be launched as far back as Winter 2021</a>, but then the developers went back to the drawing board and reworked it considerably from the original MMO-like plan into a single player open world game. At this point, a few more months won't make that much of a change.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the executive's quote, Crimson Desert will also be <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-is-bringing-crimson-desert-back-to-gamescom-with-another-playable-demo-at-this-years-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable in a new build at Gamescom</a>, PAX West, and Tokyo Game Show. We will be there at Gamescom to check out this new version and report back, so stay tuned. As a reminder, the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently confirmed that we’ll be seeing Resident Evil: Requiem gameplay during the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom, set to take place on August 19. Even more recently, notable Resident Evil leaker ‘Dusk Golem’ took to social media to uncover a series of tidbits regarding the next major release in the legendary franchise.</p>



<p>In a series of posts, Dusk Golem claimed that new lighting and shadow engines have been implemented, the AI system is unique and intelligent, and some open-level areas in Raccoon City <strong>will require a vehicle to traverse them</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-to-feature-last-of-us-part-2-combat">Resident Evil: Requiem to Feature ‘Last of Us Part 2’ Combat</h2>



<p>Dusk Golem has been a goldmine for Resident Evil leaks, but it’s always worth prefacing this with the ‘take it with a pinch of salt’ recommendation. Everything is always subject to change.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955489759536771403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a series of posts</a> on social media, Dusk Golem revealed stacks about the upcoming Resident Evil: Requiem, all of which could be confirmed or refuted next week when gameplay is shown during Opening Night Live.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Right now officially they’ve talked about as you mentioned the ability to switch between first &amp; third person on the fly (&amp; basically designing two different games alongside each other to accomplish this as require big retooling to work with both), the new lighting/shadow engine, hair engine from Pragmata. </p>



<p>Additionally we know the stalker uses a new dynamic AI system they’ve done to behave uniquely &amp; intelligently on the fly. There’s few other innovations, some I know, but also sure I don’t know all of them. </p>



<p>A small handful I don’t mindsharing is they’ve been working hard to achieve having good performance <strong>on open-level designed areas like Raccoon City, along w/a vehicle to travel around it. The combat with Leon has seen huge innovations, honestly some Last of Us Part 2-isms</strong>, but also its own innovations.</p>



<p>There’s been effort to provide more environmental physic systems and interactivity for Grace’s segments where she has to work with the environment more, &amp; balance light &amp; darkness. And more I won’t say, &amp; sure more I don’t know. But they have a lot more to reveal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dusk Golem later shared an image of Alice from the Resident Evil movie series riding a motorcycle ‘without any context’, suggesting that we’ll be using a similar mode of transport in Resident Evil: Requiem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced that Crimson Desert, the upcoming open-world action title from Pearl Abyss, has been pushed back to Q1 2026. This news was announced during a recent earnings call and accompanied by a clear explanation.</p>



<p>The team at Pearl Abyss emphasized that the plans to showcase Crimson Desert at Gamescom will remain unchanged. Next week, the game’s open-world build will be rendered playable at Gamescom for the first time, and in September, the same demo will be available to explore at the Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<h2 id="h-unavoidably-delayed">‘Unavoidably Delayed’</h2>



<p>Talking on the delay of Crimson Desert during a recent earnings conference call, the Pearl Abyss team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Currently,&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>&nbsp;has been in the process of voice-overs, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</p>



<p>The launch of&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. </p>



<p>We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>It was then stated that Crimson Desert has been given an ‘internally confirmed’ release window of Q1 2026. There will be a follow-up announcement in due course, unveiling a firmer launch date. It was stressed that Crimson Desert’s release date <strong>will not </strong>be revealed at Gamescom.</p>

<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fb4f26fb073a/the-legend-of-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're slowly learning more about the upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> movie, and following the reveal of the first cast members in July, it appears an official social media account has now been opened on the platform X (formerly known as Twitter).</p>
<p>It's tagged as <a href="https://x.com/The_Zelda_Movie">@The_Zelda_Movie</a> and in the bio mentions how the film is coming "exclusively to theatres in 2027". This follows the previous confirmation that the film would arrive on <strong>7th May 2027</strong>.</p>
<p>Notably, this account, which originally joined the platform in November 2023, has been verified as an affiliate of Sony Pictures (which is already following it back). This new page is also following the official PlayStation account. As you might recall, Sony is co-financing this project.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there have been no official news updates from the account just yet, but the page has reposted multiple stories about the cast announcements. While it's not following any Nintendo accounts just yet, it has reposted <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">Miyamoto's recent update from the Nintendo account</a> about the actors.</p>

<p>As you can see, the social account page also has a simple banner with the title 'The Legend of Zelda' in the middle.</p>
<p>Again, this follows on from the actor reveals last month – confirming Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You can find out more about this movie in our full guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Evil Marian and Super Anubis join the fight</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a> is the gift that keeps on giving, with Maximum Entertainment and developer Secret Base today adding two more playable characters to the beat 'em up as a free DLC update.</p>
<p>This time it's the "Evil Marian" and "Super Anubis" joining the fight. They follow on from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/double-dragon-gaiden-doubles-the-fun-with-a-free-dlc-update-on-switch">Jeff and Abore</a> earlier this year in April. Here's the official rundown about each fighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Evil Marian</strong> - Once a trusted ally, Marian is now under the grip of an unknown, malevolent force. Cold and distant, she floats above the ground, lashing out with psychic blasts and violent telekinesis. Her eyes are vacant, her voice devoid of emotion—something ancient has taken hold of her...and it’s not letting go.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Super Anubis</strong> - For years, whispers claimed Anubis was a fraud, a cult figure with no true power. But now, Super Anubis has emerged: levitating, glowing, and summoning dark forces beyond comprehension. The question lingers—was he a fake all along...or a prophet finally revealed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this release, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is currently on sale on Switch and Steam for 65% off. Since its original release in July 2023, this title has also received multiple other game updates, boosting the character roster and adding online play.</p>

<p>No "download required" banner in sight</p>

<figure><a title="Grand Theft Auto Trilogy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8fa8bdfdd1f85/grand-theft-auto-trilogy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Rockstar Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">arrival of Game-Key Cards</a> on the Switch 2, there has been ongoing discussion about the future of third-party physical releases. Even during the Switch generation, certain hard copy releases didn't always live up to expectations, opting to include a download code instead of the actual game.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/story-of-seasons-publisher-says-physical-switch-2-releases-are-the-right-decision-for-us">some more welcome stories</a>, and with this in mind, <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/51707-gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-sees-physical-release-with-no-download-required">there are reports today</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">Grand Theft Auto: Trilogy</a> is now available as a proper physical release on the original Switch platform after all this time.</p>
<p>This information comes via an Amazon listing for North America, with the box art no longer including a small banner mentioning download requirements. According to the same page, the release of this version was last month, and the page for the Switch release requiring a download is still live (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">thanks for the heads up, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>You can see the 'before' and 'after' shots in the social post below, which asks who will "take one for the team" and find out if this is actually the real deal by ordering a copy. Notably, it's also cheaper than the existing version that requires a download.</p>

<p>Although this is just a single listing, it's already got quite a lot of attention from Switch owners who have wanted a physical version with no downloads required to play. If it is accurate, hopefully, it comes with the more recent updates <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/rockstar-games-announces-acquisition-of-dev-behind-gta-trilogy-upgrades">by the developer 'Video Games Deluxe'</a>, who took over from the 'Grove Street Games' port team.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:178939,123546 @ 1755083393 -->
<p>If we hear any updates about this new listing for the GTA Trilogy or see it pop up in more locations, we'll let you know. Would you be interested in a proper physical release of this collection on Switch? <em>Tell us in the comments.</em></p></section>

<p>This title was one of the many games confirmed alongside the reveal of the GameCube library for the Switch Online service. It originally made its debut on the GameCube in 2005/06 and was developed by the team at Skip.</p>
<p>Here's some official PR about what to expect from this title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The little robot who wants to bring happiness to all!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Chibi-Robo is a four-inch-tall robot who's arrived at the Sanderson house with the goal of helping the family get the most out of life and find happiness. Day or night, he'll help however he can, whether that's by cleaning or looking for lost items. In this chibi action-adventure title originally released for the Nintendo GameCube™ system in 2006, you'll aim for the top of the Chibi-Rankings by gathering Happy Points and Moolah (aka money)! It's rumored that Chibi-Robo will become Super Chibi-Robo if he reaches the top of the rankings...but between a daughter who only speaks in the language of frogs and toys that come alive when humans aren't around, Chibi-Robo has his work cut out for him in the mystery-packed Sanderson house!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To play Chibi-Robo on Switch 2, you'll need to have an active subscription to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service.</p>
<p>Some of the other GameCube titles confirmed for the Switch Online's GameCube service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.
