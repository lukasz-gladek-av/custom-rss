It’s a game featuring a large cast of flawed people trying to come together to stop someone who thinks they are doing the right thing, but which will kill many. But who cares about all that? I’m here to talk about kicking people off cliffs over and over again and how much fun it is.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

After releasing live-service shooter <em>Anthem</em> and open-world checklist simulator<em>s Mass Effect Andromeda</em> and <em>Dragon Age Inquisition</em>, <em>Veilguard </em>feels like a return to form for the famous studio. The new RPG is more linear, more character-focused, and probably the best BioWare game since<em> Mass Effect 3. </em>And one big reason I love the game is that it lets me kick enemies, big and small, off cliffs and into giant pits. </p><p>Very early into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-tips-faction-inquisition-romance-1851685483"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span>, my character was given the special ability to do a powerful drop kick that sends enemies flying. And 40+ hours later, I’m still drop-kicking fools and smiling each and every time. I know the game probably expected me to try out more abilities, and I have, but I always keep the big kick in my hot bar. I can’t imagine playing <em>Veilguard </em>without it.</p><figure id="" data-id="4efbc8843e03fe95ad193a8adaec25d1" data-recommend-id="image://4efbc8843e03fe95ad193a8adaec25d1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows the main character drop kicking an enemy off a ledge.

Kick ‘em into a giant lava pit! Tiny monster that I could easily kill with two hits? Sure, why not? Drop kick that small bastard off the edge of a mountain and watch them sail into the void below. </p><p><em>Veilguard’s</em> narrative, combat, characters, and worlds are truly great and I’m loving the game a lot. But I’d be lying right now if I said the drop kick wasn’t a big reason why the new RPG is currently sitting on my preliminary game of the year list. </p><p>I’ve talked about this before on <em>Kotaku</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deathloop-players-all-agree-the-dedicated-kick-button-1847688695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deathloop-players-all-agree-the-dedicated-kick-button-1847688695">with <em>Deathloop</em></a></span>, but I give a big thumbs up to any game that lets me instantly defeat enemies by kicking them off cliffs, buildings, or ledges. <em>Veilguard </em>let me end a boss fight in seconds by kicking the enemy off a platform. Wonderful stuff. </p><p>Truly, more games could learn from <em>Veilguard</em>. If you want people to have more fun, add a big kick button.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>More than a year after Baldur's Gate 3 originally launched in August 2023, the game is still putting up impressive numbers, and has even sold one additional copy to someone who may know Pope Francis.</p><p>Larian publishing director Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1858532995084271848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some new Baldur's Gate 3 stats on social media recently</a>, beginning with how the game's average daily peak concurrent players are up 3% this year compared to last year. That likely has to do with the introduction of mods earlier this year, Douse said. Mods have proven to be extremely popular in Baldur's Gate 3, as players have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">downloaded more than 50 million of them</a>.</p><p>Daily active users, meanwhile, are up more than 20% over last year's numbers, while average daily Steam Deck users have increased 61% year-over-year. It's not clear if Douse is talking about Steam numbers specifically with all of these stats, or if they also include data from the Xbox and PlayStation versions.</p><p>These statistics are all well and good and speak to the ongoing and growing popularity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">one of 2023's best games</a>. But the real standout statistic is that Larian sold precisely one more copy in The Holy See, and specifically the Vatican itself. "Thank you Mr. Pope and enjoy the game," Douse said.</p><p>Earlier in November, Douse revealed that Larian had sold two copies of Baldur's Gate 3 in The Vatican, and that the game <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was on one other wishlist</a>. Perhaps that person has now decided to buy the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/holy-see-vatican-city/#people-and-society" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to the CIA</a>, about 1,000 people lived in Vatican City in 2022. The safest bet is that a regular person bought Baldur's Gate 3, not the Pope himself. But imagine if he did?</p><p>Pope Francis met with popular YouTubers, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pope-now-has-at-least-one-video-game-this-one/1100-6441528/" data-ref-id="1100-6441528">one person gave him a copy of the indie RPG Undertale</a>. Pope Francis is not the first world leader to have been gifted a video game. In 2011, Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/110469-Polish-Prime-Minister-Gives-Obama-Witcher-2" rel="nofollow " data-ref-id="false">gave United States president Barack Obama a copy of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>.</p><p>Following the smashing success of Baldur's Gate 3, some might have expected Larian to make Baldur's Gate 4, but the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">making something else next instead.</a> "We're working on it. If we're brutally honest, we're trying to figure out what the hell it is," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">Larian boss Swen Vincke said in May</a>. "We have ideas. We have lots of little fragments."</p><p>Beyond Larian's next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a>"We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro previously said about the future of Baldur's Gate.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Syndicate: 60 FPS Console Update Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft didn't give a reason for why this update was coming now, nearly a decade later, but encouraged players to "discover, or rediscover, this classic on new generation consoles."</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Syndicate is set in London during the Industrial Revolution and was the first entry in the series to let players choose between two different protagonists, twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob excels at close-range combat, while Evie specializes in stealth, letting players pick which character matches their playstyle or may be better suited to a specific type of mission. Syndicate is the ninth entry in the longrunning Ubisoft franchise and was the follow-up to 2014's poorly received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-unity/" data-ref-id="5000-253830">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>--criticized at launch for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-fix-assassin-s-creed-unity-bug/1100-6423555/" data-ref-id="1100-6423555">numerous (and often hilarious) bugs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft recently delayed the next main entry in the series, the feudal Japan-based Assassin's Creed Shadows, in order to further "polish and refine the experience" following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">"softer than expected" reception to Ubisoft's previous big open-world game, Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Originally slated to release this November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now arrive February 14, 2025</a>. Much like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Shadows will let players freely swap between two different protagonists, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-protagonists-launches-november-15/1100-6523473/" data-ref-id="1100-6523473">the African samurai Yasuke or the ninja-like Naoe</a>.</p>

Attorney Karl Quackenbush added the Seattle court sided with Valve, which led to Vivendi hiring a new law firm that hit the studio with multiple counterclaims, including the cancellation of the companies' initial 2001 agreement and Vivendi acquiring the entire Half-Life IP and preventing Valve from doing Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In Lynch's words, Vivendi's aim was clear: "'We're going to put Valve out of business, and then we'll bankrupt the two of you'" he said when describing their alleged strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve CEO Gabe Newell flatly called it an intimidation move, one helped by Vivendi knowing Valve's financial situation. "This was really about an assertion of power. [...] They were just trying to crank up our legal costs as another way of draining [time and money] from the company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Valve/Vivendi lawsuit took a toll on the studio, even as developers were mostly said to be siloed off from it so they could focus on making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even so, there was concerns the game could never come out, even if development did finish: at the time, Vivendi was considerably larger, and Newell remarked that at time, it was common for publishers to "bully" developers in this way.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The tide turned in Valve's favor after Vivendi made a massive mistake">The tide turned in Valve's favor after Vivendi made a massive mistake</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both Newell and Valve were "pretty close" to going bankrupt, but things turned in Valve's favor after it asked for documents covering Vivendi's activity in Asia. The documents were all in Korean, which Newell and others speculated may have been another way to drain its resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that summer, the studio employed an intern named Andrew who natively spoke the language and asked him to pore through the documents. He discovered conversations in Korean which directly implicated Vivendi in destroying documents regarding its deal with Valve "as directed"—a potentially illegal move that Quackenbush admitted to never seeing laid out quite like this in his career as a lawyer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve presented those conversations of the evidence being destroyed to the judge, who subsequently sided with the studio and halted Vivendi from further contesting the suit. In the end, Valve secured ownership of Half-Life and Counter-Strike, and ended Vivendi's cybercafe deal. The ability to distribute its own games led to the creation of Steam, which launched in September 2003 and has become a major (and often </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/valve-vivendi-legal-dispute-revealed">controversial</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) fixture of the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can learn more about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Half-Life 2's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">development, from its physics engine to the real-world faces they used for the game's characters, in NoClip's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">documentary</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

For now, few members of the Veilguard rise to the upper echelons of these rankings, but maybe, if those newcomers get as much time to develop as the veterans have had, they will surpass them someday. But for now, here’s our ranking of every <em>Dragon Age </em>party member in the main games (note that we won’t be including those characters who are added via expansions and DLC). Spoilers for all four games follow.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="111627df9fef60e31aa63b7798c46af9" data-recommend-id="image://111627df9fef60e31aa63b7798c46af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1838" data-height="1034" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sten is shown in a cage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sten is shown in a cage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="111627df9fef60e31aa63b7798c46af9" data-recommend-id="image://111627df9fef60e31aa63b7798c46af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1838" data-height="1034" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sten is shown in a cage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sten, the lone Qunari character in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, has to carry the unfortunate burden of being a walking codex entry for people who are far away from everything going on. That’s not to say Sten doesn’t have his own charms separate from telling you about the Qun. He’s a bluntly funny tortured soul who bears the weight of his culture silently until you get him to open up. Sten helps pave the way for more interesting Qunari characters like the Arishok and Iron Bull, but there are more interesting characters in <em>Origins</em>’ party.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-recommend-id="image://560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bethany sits on the ground next to Orsino." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bethany sits on the ground next to Orsino." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-recommend-id="image://560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bethany sits on the ground next to Orsino." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, protagonist Hawke has two siblings who act as temporary party members for the game’s first act. One will die in the opening with almost no ceremony, The other will get sidelined around ten hours in. Bethany, Hawke’s mage sister, easily gets the worst hand out of the two. She gets dragged away by the Circle in one route, becomes a Grey Warden in another, or she dies. Carver, Hawke’s warrior brother, has a similar setup, but he at least has some autonomy and drama in his branching paths. Bethany, meanwhile, is pretty much dragged through the story, with BioWare separating or killing every member of a family in a game ostensibly about familial ties. Bethany is comparatively sweet and understanding whereas her brother is decidedly neither of those things, but BioWare gave her nothing to work with.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1cbfef99fcb56bd35dcedfcf5db9ba0" data-recommend-id="image://b1cbfef99fcb56bd35dcedfcf5db9ba0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sebastian stares at something off-camera with with the bluest eyes you've ever seen.

Sure, he’s got his own storyline, struggling between whether or not he wants to be the ruler of Starkhaven as the brutal murder of his family has left him the only living heir. But beyond that, he mostly sways in the background of the main plot, being unwaveringly devout to the church and casting judgment upon others. His biggest contributions are his companion quest, which gives returning companion Leliana a chance to appear, and when he threatens to level the entirety of the city of Kirkwall if you don’t kill a terrorist. Which like, good for standing on your principles, king. But I barely know you. You’re the tagalong friend who awkwardly weighs in from the outskirts of the circle as everyone else is chatting. Go away!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e62fc4030dce606507e694cffeeaac93" data-recommend-id="image://e62fc4030dce606507e694cffeeaac93" data-format="jpg" data-width="2033" data-height="1148" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wynne defends mages in the Circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wynne defends mages in the Circle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e62fc4030dce606507e694cffeeaac93" data-recommend-id="image://e62fc4030dce606507e694cffeeaac93" data-format="jpg" data-width="2033" data-height="1148" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wynne defends mages in the Circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ healer mage starts off deceptively simple. Wynne is shown to be a compassionate, protective woman who cares about those around her. She scolds you for shirking your Wardenly duties to shack up with your love interest. She is the party’s grandma, and she fits that role with all the care and thorniness you’d expect. But as her story progresses, it becomes clear that her attempts to impart wisdom upon the younger generation come from her reckoning with her own mortality. Wynne is a senior to everyone else in the party, but she’s also confronted her own death once before being saved by a spirit. She wants to do the best she can with her second chance, whether that’s in making right by old mistakes or saving the world.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ddb106f4ea3b95d86156a7a318453468" data-recommend-id="image://ddb106f4ea3b95d86156a7a318453468" data-format="jpg" data-width="1917" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Oghren holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Oghren holds his axe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddb106f4ea3b95d86156a7a318453468" data-recommend-id="image://ddb106f4ea3b95d86156a7a318453468" data-format="jpg" data-width="1917" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Oghren holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Oghren is the type of character who could easily fall into being a comic relief party member. The dwarven warrior is a boisterous drunk, but it’s all to bury his angst at the apparent loss of his wife who disappeared into the underground Deep Roads. Oghren quickly becomes one of the Warden’s most loyal companions, even following them into the Grey Wardens’ ranks in the <em>Awakening </em>expansion. He starts out prickly but endears himself to the group almost immediately. He’s one of the best sources of banter and raunchy wit, but he’s never without heart to balance it out with substance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Carver suffers from most of the same problems Bethany does, but his equivalent to her Circle route is what gives him the upper hand. If you choose to leave him behind on the Deep Roads expedition in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s first act, he will choose to join the church’s mage-oppressive military outfit, the Templars. He does this as an act of defiance against his older sibling and it plays into the tension developed throughout the first chunk of the game. After that, he is gone for most of the game much like Bethany, only showing up during climactic moments like a glorified cameo. It’s a shame.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It is incredibly fitting that Cole, the spirit of compassion who can join the Inquisition, has the ability to make people forget about him, because that dude is unfortunately a pretty forgettable guy. Cole is by no means a bad character, but his story doesn’t quite live up to the highs of his peers. Cole’s existence as something in between a spirit and a human, and how he chooses to lean into one path or the other, creates some interesting routes for the character, but it ultimately hits with the same fervor as a fairly forgettable side quest. He’s good! He’s just unremarkable against the competition.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="003e99eaf61c81c904708492dea845d5" data-recommend-id="image://003e99eaf61c81c904708492dea845d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1378" data-height="776" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zevran looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zevran looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="003e99eaf61c81c904708492dea845d5" data-recommend-id="image://003e99eaf61c81c904708492dea845d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1378" data-height="776" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Zevran looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You couldn’t get off on a worse foot than Zevran does with the Warden. The elven assassin greets you with a dagger and killing intent and manages to talk you out of killing him on sight. Do you know how charming you have to be to go from getting ready to take someone out for good to being a (mostly) trusted member of the crew? They let him sleep in a tent with them and everything. Zevran sometimes feels like the “forgotten” member of <em>Origins</em>’ team as he didn’t go on to become a series mainstay like the rest of the game’s potential romantic interests. But despite falling into some tropes as a seductive assassin, he still always manages to win me over each time I’m passing through Ferelden.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Josephine Montilyet is the only advisor in <em>Inquisition </em>who fans didn’t have an established relationship with prior to the 2014 RPG, and she still managed to carve out her place in their hearts. As the Inquisition’s resident diplomat, Josie is always thinking practically where Cullen might send soldiers to handle a problem and Leliana would cut its throat. As her story unfolds, it’s revealed that the most buttoned-up character in Skyhold has a bit of a wild side, but is still a fan of the finer things in life, like theater and team base gossip. Despite her political expertise, Josie is one of the most grounded, charismatic characters in <em>Inquisition</em>. Her story isn’t about some massive faction or world-shattering event, it’s about a girl who is trying to make sense of a world where dragons roam and people can shoot fire from their hands.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The only returning companion from <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>is inarguably the most impactful in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>. Anders is a far cry from the wisecracking apostate we met in the <em>Awakening </em>expansion—he’s now a tortured radical after being possessed by the spirit of Justice. He becomes a healer in the city of Kirkwall, growing more and more fanatical as the game goes on and he watches injustice unfold against the mages. Eventually, whether by his own fanaticism or the spirit’s influence, Anders blows up the Kirkwall Chantry, sparking a mage rebellion that changes the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe forever.</p><p>All of that makes him a compelling but divisive character. People love Anders for his tragic angst as much as others hate him for being a terrorist. In most versions of his story, I fall into the former camp. But Anders’ rivalry path, in which you can convince him to turn on and murder the mages he just sought to free, remains one of the most baffling and cowardly decisions BioWare has ever made with the <em>Dragon Age </em>franchise. It technically works within the game’s friendship and rivalry system, in which you can have a friendly or adversarial relationship with your party that can challenge their worldview, but it’s also such an irresponsible moment that is, sadly, par for the course with how <em>Dragon Age </em>tends to “both sides” issues of oppression. As the face of this conflict in <em>Dragon Age</em>, Anders inevitably has to bear the baggage of a series that has never wanted to take a side and failed to make a case for both arguments. And it undermines him and the story of <em>Dragon Age 2</em> in the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sera, the elven rogue and Friend of Red Jenny, is an acquired taste. She’s impulsive, disruptive, and judgemental, but she is a product of the world she’s been raised in. As a city elf, Sera has seen the worst of how Thedas treats elves and anyone who isn’t seen as part of the upper class. She’s rebellious and pursues her idea of justice with reckless abandon. That means she’s also a source of tension and drama as she butts heads with anyone who doesn’t fit her idea of what elves should be. Sera is thorny but that’s what makes her delightful when you get closer to her, letting you look past the manic angst and see someone who wants things to be better.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36d44a36318ae1ab7c161ffbc7c4cfca" data-recommend-id="image://36d44a36318ae1ab7c161ffbc7c4cfca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis is shown looking at something off-screen with his wings expanding from his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis is shown looking at something off-screen with his wings expanding from his back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36d44a36318ae1ab7c161ffbc7c4cfca" data-recommend-id="image://36d44a36318ae1ab7c161ffbc7c4cfca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis is shown looking at something off-screen with his wings expanding from his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Admittedly, your mileage on Lucanis and Neve may hinge on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168">which city you choose to save in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s first act</a></span>, as not helping their respective homes will narrow the possibilities of their arcs. To be clear, I’ve seen both variations before writing this ranking, and still would probably put him at the bottom of this list. Lucanis is a web of fascinating contradictions. On the surface, he seems like a character ripe for tiresome edgy nonsense with his brooding demeanor, magic crow wings that he uses to fly around and strike his targets from above, and the fact that the demon embodiment of Spite lives within him. But he’s also kind of a golden retriever.</p><p>Lucanis drinks more coffee than any writer you’ve met, just to stay awake and maintain control of his body, cooks for the team and remembers all their favorite foods, and he is protective of those he cares about. His story is a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-esque political drama with family ties and blood magic in the mix, and unfortunately, it can feel a bit truncated on certain playthroughs. Still, Lucanis’ inner struggle with his literal and figurative demons shines through.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="481f2371fce544d3766a866fd9166bd9" data-recommend-id="image://481f2371fce544d3766a866fd9166bd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1127" data-height="634" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shale frozen in front of a hut." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shale frozen in front of a hut." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="481f2371fce544d3766a866fd9166bd9" data-recommend-id="image://481f2371fce544d3766a866fd9166bd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1127" data-height="634" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shale frozen in front of a hut." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As <em>Origins</em>’ DLC character, not enough people have gotten to experience Shale in all her glory.

Shale’s initial nihilism is somehow never exhausting because of the pitch-perfect writing of each line she utters, and watching her reluctantly grow into someone who cares about the party when she has spent hours roasting them is a delight. I’m watching videos of her banter and it is such a shame that not everyone who played <em>Origins</em> got to meet Shale.

This is a man who started out dedicated to the church and his calling as a mage-fighting Templar just to watch it fail him and others time and time again. Like several other characters in <em>Inquisition</em>, Cullen reckons with who he is after the systems he bought into have fallen apart. Depending on the player’s actions, he can grow from all he’s endured in <em>Origins </em>and <em>Dragon Age II</em>, or he can succumb to the rot the church put inside him. He’s an effective symbol for the failing systems of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and an excellent reminder that its people and the world they live in are not beyond saving.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been a lot of Qunari throughout the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but none have made an impression quite like Iron Bull. The mercenary is a double agent, but he’s refreshingly upfront about it when you meet him. He’s a fun-loving warrior who likes to drink, kill dragons, bro about with his team, and fuck. But despite his seemingly one-track mind, Iron Bull is one of the only characters who can actually betray you if you give him a reason to. Depending on your choices in the main game, Iron Bull may turn on you during the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC with seemingly no remorse; even if you’ve entered a romantic relationship with him. The Qunari spy told you who he was, and he will still be that by the end if you don’t give him a reason to be anyone else. You can’t judge a book by its cover, even if the title on the spine tells you everything you need to know.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-recommend-id="image://2de1da4a1f8944ce07a2d102d5df8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Taash is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The lone qunari on the team is an interesting one. Taash joins The Veilguard initially to help the team fight the dragons they’ll face when fighting the elven gods. Though their foes are the size of buildings, their biggest fight is the one they deal with internally as they navigate the intersection of gender and culture. Taash is standing between two worlds: the Qunari one they were born in, and the Rivain one they have grown into. They feel pulled in different directions, whether that be in the way they dress, the food they eat, or the gender they identify as.</p><p>Though Taash can initially come off as bullheaded and deadpan, it’s clear they are an introspective, thoughtful person who wants to be themself, but also seeks the approval of those who have cared for them. Finding yourself when you have so many forces telling you who you’re supposed to be is a pretty universal concept, but watching <em>The Veilguard</em> wrestle with these ideas within its own world remains one of the series’ strengths, and Taash is one of the most endearing and entertaining examples under its belt.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-recommend-id="image://bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leliana talks to the Inquisitor.

Some of this was explained retroactively through epilogues, but those did little to alleviate feelings of the spymaster being one of BioWare’s seemingly unkillable favorites. Though she serves as a case study in <em>Dragon Age</em>’s complicated relationship with continuity, Leliana’s story in <em>Inquisition</em>, much like Cullen’s, shows one of the few mainstays of each <em>Dragon Age </em>game finally becoming who they were always meant to be. After saving the world once, Leliana has gone from the once soft-spoken bard to a cunning agent of the Inquisition. She is disenfranchised from the church, but not the people she served alongside. She has the potential to become the leader of the church within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe, and depending on whether you push her to remain compassionate or steel herself, her reign can be paved with kindness or blood. <em>Inquisition </em>is all about watching the world change and seeing the people who make it happen become who they’re supposed to be, and despite the series-wide complications, Leliana shines once more in her third appearance.</p><p>Back in the <em>Origins </em>days, she had none of that baggage and was simply a repentant sister of the Chantry with a dark past and a devout demeanor. She is one of the few bright lights in <em>Origins</em>, even as the reality of who she once was becomes clear. Leliana shifts and changes to match the needs of <em>Dragon Age</em> more than once, but there is something refreshing about looking back at where she began. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-recommend-id="image://08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="506" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fenris strikes an enemy down with his sword.

He’s been made into a living weapon at the behest of his mage master, and lost his family, memory, and almost all of his sense of self before escaping to Kirkwall. It’s only natural he’s dismissive and untrusting of mages. If you press him on this, he comes to see the issues with lumping every mage into the same pile as the slavers he knew in Tevinter. Fenris is one of the best examples of how <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s friendships and rivalries can diverge in life-altering ways, and the delicious angst that comes with romancing him as rival mage Hawke is unmatched. He operates on an extreme in a game that sometimes has trouble dealing with the nuances of the conflict it centers on, but his relationship is most rewarding when you try to help him see the gray in between the black and white.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kirkwall’s Captain of the Guard is probably the most grounded of <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s companions. She’s not a radical mage, a swash-buckling pirate on the lookout for her next adventure, or a blood mage consorting with a demon. Aveline’s just a woman trying to get by and comfortably sleep at night. She starts as a member of the City Guard before her sense of honesty kicks in and she uncovers corruption in her ranks, leading to her ascending to the role of Captain. But even as she climbs the ladder of city defense, her story doesn’t escalate in scale, instead staying endearing and lowkey. Some of the most memorable moments in <em>Dragon Age 2</em> are the quiet ones away from all the political strife, and Aveline’s painfully awkward attempt at courting her husband-to-be remains an incredible sequence that perfectly pulls off how even the strongest among us can be as vulnerable and clumsy as anyone else. She is a woman of multitudes, the beating heart of Hawke’s team, and a shining beacon for the idea of using what time you have in this life to do right by others.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blackwall, or a man going by that name, is one of the most slept-on characters in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. He is initially believed to be a Grey Warden sent to find people to join their Darkspawn-killing ranks. It turns out, however, that he’s not a Warden at all, but a man named Thom Rainer who took on the name after the true Warden Blackwall recruited and was then killed protecting him. Rainer, believing his life otherwise forfeit, assumed Blackwall’s identity and strove to continue his work as a Warden. But in taking another man’s identity, he sought to erase his own, including his past crimes and treachery. As the guilt of his past failings catches up to him, Blackwall’s story can go multiple ways. He can accept his punishment, be given to the Wardens, or be given freedom to atone without hiding. A lot of those big reveals have gone unnoticed by fans because they’re buried under a story that feels like that of a pretty standard, overly stoic fantasy RPG warrior. Once all is said and done, though, Blackwall’s story is a pretty damn effective tale of owning up to one’s mistakes, and proudly being better.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54a6ac7ff6c9a2a3920b7b686be54fc6" data-recommend-id="image://54a6ac7ff6c9a2a3920b7b686be54fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Warden greets the Mabari." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Warden greets the Mabari." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54a6ac7ff6c9a2a3920b7b686be54fc6" data-recommend-id="image://54a6ac7ff6c9a2a3920b7b686be54fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Warden greets the Mabari." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It took every ounce of my self-control to not put the Mabari hound you recruit early on in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> at the very top of this list.

The elven mage, introduced as an expert on ancient elf technology and magic, seems scatterbrained if she’s not fixated on one of her interests. But as her story unfolds, it becomes clear that Bellara’s preoccupation with elven artifacts, lost history, and hobbies like fiction writing are all born out of a need to distract herself from her grief, and possibly make up for her failures.<br></p><p>When you meet her, Bellara has been hunting for a way to make the world make sense again, only for the elven gods she had known her whole life to return, and everything she knew is repeatedly flipped on its head. What does someone who seeks to restore history do when it’s constantly changing? What decisions do you make when the answers you’ve found can hurt those who have already gone through so much? Bellara is the kind of character a story like <em>The Veilguard </em>needs: as the world changes, she’s the most well-equipped to understand its significance and ponder the effects it will have on everyone when the dust settles.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-recommend-id="image://3d8946eeccb14873e15b9a18889f2726" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Davrin is shown looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Veilguard</em>’s Grey Warden companion is a man-and-a-half. Davrin is a monster hunter who carves each of the beasts he faces into wooden statues from logs he cuts himself. He’s also a great bird-cat father to Assan, one of the last griffons who was once thought extinct in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe. How could I not fall for the lumberjack bird-cat dad who is doomed by the narrative because he’s part of a faction that will one day go underground to die when they start to go mad from the darkspawn taint inside him?</p><p>But I digress. Davrin is one of the best examples <em>The Veilguard </em>has of a character whose very personal story has long standing ramifications for the world of <em>Dragon Age</em>. As a Warden, Davrin knows his time is relatively limited, and feels a great deal of responsibility to protect those around him. He wants to ensure that he leaves the world better than he found it. The revelations he finds in his quest fundamentally shift how the Wardens will be viewed in the annals of history, but he doesn’t lose sight of the good those still living under the banner can do. All of this is delivered with a heartfelt story of a man and his bird-cat son learning to love and live with each other.

The dwarven rogue started as a supporting character in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and that’s a long time for fans to project an idealized vision of the mostly jovial scout in their minds. But Harding is so much more complex in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and a lot of it has to do with its willingness to examine the cracks in the happy-go-lucky attitude she’s been known for.</p><p>Harding becomes a centerpiece for some of the biggest reveals in dwarven lore <em>Dragon Age </em>has ever dropped, and as she uncovers truths about her people, her anger for what the dwarves have lost becomes central to her world. Things are changing for everyone in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and it often feels like Harding has no one to relate to as she carries heavy dwarven baggage on her back. Rage for what she and her people have lost doesn’t have to consume her, as justified as it might be. But one way or another, someone who once played the support role for the Inquisition becomes a pillar for the dwarven people to build upon. It’s inspiring to see.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b23dc8edd9d8c5f820349e3a522151ae" data-recommend-id="image://b23dc8edd9d8c5f820349e3a522151ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1677" data-height="943" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alistair sits next to a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alistair sits next to a campfire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b23dc8edd9d8c5f820349e3a522151ae" data-recommend-id="image://b23dc8edd9d8c5f820349e3a522151ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1677" data-height="943" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alistair sits next to a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alistair has become such a focal point in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe (some might argue <em>too</em> much so) that, on any given day, he could rank at the top of an <em>Origins</em> companion ranking.

Alistair’s complexities and different possible fates put him into so many quantum states in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe that it doesn’t surprise me BioWare decided to say “fuck it” and write more stories about him in books and comics that firmly set him in one place in the universe, though they’ve done a better job keeping player choice consistent across each game than Leliana.

As much as I disagree with Vivienne’s beliefs on a fundamental level, I can’t help but be drawn in by the nuance. Vivienne is a mage who fully admits that she and people like her are dangerous, and a system like the Circle could probably alleviate everyone’s problems, but not in its current form. Whereas <em>Dragon Age II</em> paints mages as an oppressed class of people (while also simultaneously believing that they are inevitably going to become threats to society no matter what you do), Vivienne’s view of the situation is far more complex, and it makes you wonder if the catastrophic events of <em>Dragon Age II</em> might have gone very differently if only someone like her had been in Kirkwall. As a person who plays a mage in all of these games, hearing her condescend to me when I say mages should be free still feels like a particularly bad case of tinnitus, but she at least is talking more sensibly about the situation than anyone else in the room, all while having to shoulder her own personal burdens. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s inability to sit with that nuance has been the undoing of a lot of its world-building. It needed a character like Vivienne two games ago.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-recommend-id="image://acb8af2d200907522fa688e54bf69010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Emmrich is shown talking to Manfred in a dark area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every friend group needs a silly guy. Emmrich, a necromancer with a skeleton assistant named Manfred, fills that role. Though raising the dead sounds like dirty, scary work (and not everyone on the team is thrilled by the notion), this mage is an eccentric, kind hearted, and often goofy old man who is a joy to be around. Though death and grief are universal concepts that could be part of any universe, Emmrich spends much of his time studying and celebrating death as a cultural concept within Thedas.</p><p>Some of the most memorable scenes in <em>The Veilguard </em>are the quiet moments when he regales you with stories about his fascination with death, how we face it, and how he maintains respect for those who are gone as he brings them back. But what does a person who deals in life and death feel about his own oncoming end? What do they think when the death in question is no longer something abstract and related to people they’ve never known? Emmrich explores those ideas in his work, but once <em>The Veilguard</em> makes him confront his relationship with death, he is catapulted to one of the most memorable mages we’ve ever met in Thedas.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51c9e22a235031ae75bdad3f27e02440" data-recommend-id="image://51c9e22a235031ae75bdad3f27e02440" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela talks to someone off-screen in front of a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isabela talks to someone off-screen in front of a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51c9e22a235031ae75bdad3f27e02440" data-recommend-id="image://51c9e22a235031ae75bdad3f27e02440" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela talks to someone off-screen in front of a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Isabela starts out as a scheming pirate who is so cool, you want to be like her when you grow up. The rogue is cunning, promiscuous, and a bit brash, and she’s also one of the series’ best-written companions. Isabela is always found at the Hanged Man bar, tossing back drinks and ready to read anyone around her to filth, but she is nurturing, wise, and loyal to a fault…if you help her get there.</p><p>The pirate can leave the party if she and Hawke aren’t close enough by the end of Act 2, but if you’ve either shown that you’re just as much a free spirit as she is or have berated her for the errors of her disloyal ways, she shows back up in a big damn hero moment, ready to save the day. Then you have to fight for her life (or give her up, if you’re a bastard) and it’s all very romantic. While Isabela is technically an optional companion in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, her actions play a big part in setting up the political turmoil happening in Kirkwall. When she’s not there, her absence is felt, and when she is there, she makes sure everyone knows she’s the star of the show.</p><p>Isabela’s role in <em>The Veilguard </em>is probably the least dramatic of all the previous party member cameos. She leads the Lords of Fortune regardless of whatever happened to her in <em>Dragon Age II</em>. The destination is good, but her dialogue is one of the more glaring examples of BioWare not practicing what it preaches regarding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112">not treating specific choices as canon</a></span>, given Isabela is assumed recruited and on decent terms with the Kirkwall crew.

But in both routes, there’s something compelling about watching the mage detective in her element. Neve knows the name of a lot of the people you meet on the streets of Minrathous. Even as the elven gods are blighting cities and some of the biggest revelations of the Dragon Age universe are raining down upon Rook and their team, Neve doesn’t lose sight of the people on the ground who will still be struggling if and when the Veilguard accomplishes their mission to stop the gods. The question is whether she wants to fight for them from the shadows, or become a beacon of hope to pave a new path in the city.</p><p>Neve is perhaps the most concise example of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s broader thesis. Where often the series shaves down conflict and progress into factions and choices nudged by the player, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like the series finally believes in something, rather than just showing you a nuanced ideological battle and letting you choose which one deserves to be wiped from the face of Thedas.</p><p>Neve believes that the world can be better, and is willing to do whatever it takes to find that path forward. Oppression and the structures that allow it are not choices or debates in her mind; she is here to fight for the people of Minrathous, it’s just a matter of how. This world is changing, and there are people who will be written in the history books as those who charted the course. Neve may choose to omit herself from the official stories if she can, but she won’t sit idly by while those who benefit from the way things have always been try to direct how things will be.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Religious upheaval is a central theme of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and no companion embodies that more than Cassandra. She’s the first character the Inquisitor gets in their party, and she is immediately suspicious of you. As far as she can tell, you are a symbol of everything she knows of the world changing. If you’re unwilling to play along with her worldview, any potential friendship between the two of you can sour almost immediately. How is she supposed to support the Inquisition when the person at its center is a heretic? Her reckoning only unravels further as she learns that the organization she has followed for most of her life has been corrupt, oppressing mages in ways deemed inhumane by even <em>Dragon Age </em>standards. Cassandra is one of the most devout people we’ve met in a series full of radicals, and yet while she struggles with the truths laid before her, she doesn’t shy away from them in the end. It would be so easy for a weaker person to retreat, deny the truth, and become stagnant. Cassandra watches the world change and decides to change with it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Across BioWare’s catalog, there probably isn’t a character with more emotional range than Merrill, the Dalish blood mage. When Hawke first meets her, she seems young and innocent, but it becomes clear she’s viewed in contempt by her elven clan. It becomes clear shortly after that she has been working with a demon and using the much-reviled blood magic. Even as she casts spells that would be taboo elsewhere in the world, she is still somehow one of the most light-hearted and humorous characters in the entire series. Merrill is the sweetest character in Hawke’s crew, even as she is berated by just about everyone else for her “crimes” of using blood magic. Though it would be easy to make her come off like an abused puppy, she is steadfast in her decisions, as she believes she can use this magic for the good of the Dalish people by restoring a piece of their history.</p><p>Merrill’s conviction leads her and those around her down devastating paths, and her story is one of the most frustratingly complex situations Hawke deals with in their story because every decision and outcome feels painful for everyone involved. Ultimately there is no happy ending for someone who consorts with demons, nor for people who distrusted her so much that they couldn’t let her face the consequences. But Merrill is subversive, tragic, and somehow, still a joy to know.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7611a43bd87e51aec1d12ffda5ebc697" data-recommend-id="image://7611a43bd87e51aec1d12ffda5ebc697" data-format="jpg" data-width="1230" data-height="693" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loghain looks at a battlefield next to his troops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Loghain looks at a battlefield next to his troops." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7611a43bd87e51aec1d12ffda5ebc697" data-recommend-id="image://7611a43bd87e51aec1d12ffda5ebc697" data-format="jpg" data-width="1230" data-height="693" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Loghain looks at a battlefield next to his troops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ secret companion Loghain Mac Tir is, by all accounts, a reprehensible individual whose actions cost the lives of countless people on the way to recruiting him. The cost for adding him to your party is so high that most people never actually get to hear <em>Origins</em>’ villain out. Do I think his claims that he sabotaged the people of Ferelden to <em>save</em> his country are enough to exonerate him of his crimes? No. But I do find him compelling as a villain who, in a delusional patriotic mania, sought to scorch the earth and rebuild it in his image.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="552a0f019b4e2bfd5e1b1035c369faa2" data-recommend-id="image://552a0f019b4e2bfd5e1b1035c369faa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorian and the Inquisitor stand in a dark hallway." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dorian and the Inquisitor stand in a dark hallway." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="552a0f019b4e2bfd5e1b1035c369faa2" data-recommend-id="image://552a0f019b4e2bfd5e1b1035c369faa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorian and the Inquisitor stand in a dark hallway." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Throughout <em>Dragon Age</em>, the land of the Tevinter Imperium has been almost exclusively framed as a culturally homogenous, villainous place where mages rule without opposition, slavery is commonplace, and unspeakable evils made it the origin point of the Blight, one of the most ruinous phenomena in the universe. Our frame of reference for this perception, however, is largely from characters who were suffering at the ground level, at least until Dorian Pavus struts into view in <em>Inquisition</em>. By all accounts, Dorian should be thrilled with his setup in Tevinter. He’s the son of a powerful family, has been given every resource to nurture his magical talents, and is pretty much guaranteed a spot at the top of the country’s politics. But he is also his own man, and does not wish to cave to the life his family envisions for him. That includes standing proud as a gay man unwilling to continue his family’s bloodline, even as he is threatened with a magical take on conversion therapy at the hands of his own father.</p><p>Dorian escapes his home in Tevinter and is clearly jaded when he meets the Inquisitor. But as he watches the world change before him, how should he view his home country that, despite everything, he still loves? The heroes of the <em>Dragon Age</em> series have often fallen into cynical cycles of scorching the earth, as if they can’t conceive of a better option. Dorian Pavus, who’s been put through hell in Tevinter, could have easily been a cautionary tale reinforcing that his home country is just as terrible as everyone in the series has ever told us it is. But instead, he’s a shining beacon proclaiming that it doesn’t have to be this way. He is radical hope personified, living, breathing proof that history is defined by those who believe that a better world is possible.</p><p>In <em>The Veilguard</em>, Dorian is putting that belief into practice. He is a member of the Shadow Dragons revolutionary group, but he has his sights set higher. Depending on your choices, Dorian can ascend to the Archon throne in Minrathous. Having someone who cares about the people of Tevinter at the top feels like the natural conclusion to his story, and one of the more hopeful conclusions <em>The Veilguard </em>can leave off on. The elven gods have decimated Thedas, even after Rook defeats them, so it’s good to see someone who wants to build something better on top of the rubble finally have the power to do it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3cc3daf0ee4c6eb2291c996e4f75000" data-recommend-id="image://c3cc3daf0ee4c6eb2291c996e4f75000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric points at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric points at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3cc3daf0ee4c6eb2291c996e4f75000" data-recommend-id="image://c3cc3daf0ee4c6eb2291c996e4f75000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric points at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Good ol’ Varric Tethras’ debut established him as a fan favorite and positioned him to become one of the longest-running characters in BioWare’s fantasy series. The dwarven storyteller starts out as a humble businessman looking for an expedition partner but quickly gets dragged into unprecedented times as the city of Kirkwall becomes a focal point for worldwide change. Varric’s ties to the city run deep, but as he becomes estranged from his family, he finds a new one in Hawke and the others. In the end, he’s left alone as the others flee the city, and he stays behind to tell their story to anyone who will listen. It’s funny to think about how what he has to deal with here is like child’s play compared to the tasks he undertakes in <em>Inquisition</em> and again in <em>The Veilguard</em>. But his greatness has small beginnings, and he’s only become greater since we met him as Hawke in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>.</p><p>When he shows up again in <em>Inquisition</em>, Varric has become a face for the <em>Dragon Age </em>series. I have a lot of love for the dwarven storyteller, but I think my appreciation for his story in <em>Inquisition</em> has only grown stronger. Varric has gone from a simple roguish businessman in Kirkwall to a teller of tales, recalling some of the biggest moments in history to anyone who will listen. He has become quiteworld-weary by the time of <em>Inquisition</em>, but he’s never lost hope. His personal questline isn’t world-shattering, but it’s a reminder that this man has been dragged through unprecedented times.</p><p>When <em>The Veilguard</em> begins, we find Varric still fighting against impossible odds, which speaks to his determination to save the world. He recruits Rook, believes wholeheartedly in their ability to stop Solas’ plan to tear down the veil, and cheers them on from an infirmary bed for most of the game. However, something about Varric’s role in the game seems off, at least initially. But what starts off feeling like a cheap trick on BioWare’s part to sideline the series’ longest-running consistent party member turns out to be a thematic pillar holding up the story of <em>The Veilguard</em>. Rook’s presence at the center of this story is an expression of Varric’s belief in people, and the way this all wraps up in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s final hours is a devastating and beautiful tribute to the storyteller who has been at the player’s side for over a decade. For me, Varric had always been a reliable confidant as I watched Thedas constantly change. After <em>The Veilguard</em>, he was a concise expression of how <em>Dragon Age </em>has changed for the better. A man who started out as a rogueish storyteller in the slums of Kirkwall watched history uncaringly unfold for decades eventually found himself swept up in adventures of his own, and those adventures made him believe in the people he would leave behind. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11265326c44abacb0f9fa29271dcfc45" data-recommend-id="image://11265326c44abacb0f9fa29271dcfc45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Morrigan crosses her arm as she talks to Rook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrigan crosses her arm as she talks to Rook." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11265326c44abacb0f9fa29271dcfc45" data-recommend-id="image://11265326c44abacb0f9fa29271dcfc45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Morrigan crosses her arm as she talks to Rook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>From the outset Morrigan, the Witch of the Wilds, is an enigma. She’s kicked out of her secluded life in the Korcari Wilds by her equally enigmatic mother and forced to learn about the rest of the world. Typically, she does so from a high horse, judging people affected by systems that were in place long before she was even born. It’s interesting to hear an outsider weigh in on things that have always been commonplace to most people in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe, but it also exposes her ignorance about how shackles like the Circle of Magi’s mage prison come to be. Still, her words often seem prophetic, hinting at how the world will change in future games.</p><p>Morrigan always knew she was destined for something bigger than her isolation, but watching her uncover what that is throughout <em>Origins</em> as she stumbles confidently through a world she knows very little about is one of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s strongest narrative arcs. She ends <em>Origins</em> on her own terms, one way or another, and when we see her again in <em>Inquisition</em>, she has become the influential force she was always meant to be, but she has also learned to be caring and curious, and is still susceptible to that same unfortunate hubris. Morrigan is one of the most recognizable characters in <em>Dragon Age</em>, not because BioWare trots her out at every opportunity, but because when she is on screen, her presence always matters.</p><p>That is especially true in <em>The Veilguard</em>, as Morrigan once again appears to help the world change. While <em>The Veilguard </em>is being rightfully criticized for its lack of narrative carryover from previous games, Morrigan’s role in the fourth entry feels like the culmination of mysteries we’ve been looking for answers to since as far back as <em>Origins</em>. When she and Rook meet, Morrigan has found so much of the knowledge she has sought out, and all that new wisdom has brought with it humility and a desire to make up for past wrongs, all while maintaining a humanity that could easily be lost in someone who has seen and experienced so much. <em>The Veilguard </em>pretty succinctly wraps up most of Morrigan’s remaining mysteries (and ignores a few, seemingly for the sake of easy choice carryover), so whatever <em>Dragon Age </em>has in store for the future, she may finally get to rest. However, it’s not in her character to sit back while the world changes.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6cc971b6c453556a631443bb881f44eb" data-recommend-id="image://6cc971b6c453556a631443bb881f44eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas looks at something off-screen with cuts and blood all over his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solas looks at something off-screen with cuts and blood all over his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6cc971b6c453556a631443bb881f44eb" data-recommend-id="image://6cc971b6c453556a631443bb881f44eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas looks at something off-screen with cuts and blood all over his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At first, Solas is one of the less remarkable characters in Inquisition’s roster. He’s characterized by his knowledge of Fade-related magic, has some cool hat tricks to show you in his early conversations, and altogether seems a bit smug and judgy. Things start to change, though, as he reveals he is the source of Big Bad Corypheus’ magic. He shows frustration with the ways of the modern world, his personal quests solidify and reinforce his anger at how flippantly people view spirits, and when all is said and done, he leaves the Inquisition without a word. Then it’s revealed why Solas feels like a person out of time: He is the Dread Wolf, an elven trickster god who has awoken to find himself written in history as a traitor to his people. Solas reveals in the Trespasser DLC that he barely viewed his friends in the Inquisition as people, and was using them to further his plan to tear down the Veil that separates the real world from the spirit realm and bring back the elves’ long-lost immortality. That all changed as he grew to care for the friends he made along the way, but his mission can’t bend to newfound sentimentality. Underneath Solas’ pompous exterior is a man ravaged by guilt for what he did several millennia ago. Should he succeed in tearing down the Veil he created, that old guilt will be replaced with a new one as he watches the world burn to correct his mistake.</p><p>In <em>The Veilguard</em>, it’s revealed that Solas’ crimes extend far beyond the Veil and his betrayal of the Inquisitor. Though the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">no longer bears his name</a></span>, Solas is the beating heart of Rook’s story, existing as a foil for the hero and also the trigger for the cataclysm that nearly swallows Thedas whole. But <em>The Veilguard </em>isn’t just about Solas’ present, it also dives deep into the elven god of lies’ past and reveals that his history is the history of Thedas. The well of Solas’ regret runs so much deeper than we ever knew, and having to face someone who is no longer hiding who he is means dealing with all the regret, shame, and conniving fuckery he’s capable of. After you’ve learned everything there is to know about Solas, you’re left with a choice of whether or not he can be redeemed, or if you even want to give him the opportunity. That there is such hotly contested debate among fans over whether Solas’ actions were justified speaks to the complexities of his views, and solidifies his spot as the most compelling party member the series has yet put forth.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/three-upcoming-free-to-play-games-may-dominate-the-end-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>2024 has been a genuinely excellent year for video game releases, but most to date have been full price titles that drain your wallet and bank account. I don’t know about you, but even doing this job, I can’t afford every new release. It’s nice to download a new title, play it for tens or hundreds of hours, and not spend a dime. Well, that’s about to become much easier, as three upcoming free-to-play games are coming before the year’s end, and I’m sure they’ll dominate!</p>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-free-to-play-games-coming-before-2024-ends">Upcoming Free-to-Play Games Coming Before 2024 Ends</h2>



<p>Three high-profile free-to-play titles are launching in December, each within a different genre, and they’re all building momentum before release for various reasons. We have <strong>Delta Force</strong>, the upcoming “Battlefield killer,” <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>, a hero shooter with team-based PvP, and <strong>Path of Exile 2</strong>, the positively monumental ARPG with its iconic passive skill tree and class roster.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force">Delta Force</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Delta Force</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Team Jade</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 4</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: First-Person Shooter</li>
</ul>



<p>The free-to-play first-person shooter from developer Team Jade, which many consider the ultimate “Battlefield killer” (as if we haven’t had a thousand of those), has enjoyed immense success with its multiple beta test periods over the past few months. We here at Insider Gaming spent a lot of time with the <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-delta-force/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a></strong> and even called it the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Battlefield game played in years</a>.”</p>



<p>It includes countless weapons and weapon customization opportunities, vehicle combat, multiple game modes, a single-player story-driven experience, an extraction game mode, and large-scale infantry combat encounters with sizeable maps that ensure every round feels unique and thrilling.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Marvel Rivals</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: NetEase Games</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 5</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: Hero Shooter</li>
</ul>



<p>While I’m personally exhausted by the hero shooter genre after playing a few rounds of Overwatch six years ago, I know it’s still a popular competitive scene with an entire subset of the gaming community champing at the bit for a hit to release. <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>, from NetEase Games, may be that hit as a free-to-play third-person shooter that combines the classic arena-style combat of titles like Overwatch and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> with Marvel’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/39-marvel-rivals-characters-found-from-closed-alpha-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roster of heroes and villains</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals features 6v6 arena-based combat with evolving battlefields in which superheroes and supervillains utilize abilities and powers to dominate objectives and the enemy team. You can play as Rocket Raccoon, Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, and countless others, dealing damage and stomping through the environment in unbeatable action!</p>







<h3 id="h-path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Path of Exile 2</li>



<li><strong>Developer</strong>: Grinding Gear Games</li>



<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: December 6</li>



<li><strong>Price</strong>: Free to Play</li>



<li><strong>Genre</strong>: Action RPG</li>
</ul>



<p>I genuinely cannot get enough of the ARPG genre. I grew up playing the likes of Champions of Norrath and the original Diablo titles alongside my stepfather, and the love for the grind stuck with me decades later. Now, you’ll often find me in either Diablo IV or Path of Exile, and like many of you, I’m eagerly awaiting the latter’s sequel. Well, it’s time. <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-path-of-exile-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a></strong> launches in Early Access on December 6, featuring an expansive campaign, a six-player co-op, an enhanced passive skill tree, and more class and play style variety than ever before.</p>



<p>With six acts, more than 100 boss fights, over 600 unique enemies, 12 base classes, and 36 Ascendancies, Path of Exile 2 promises to be bigger, better, and more time-consuming than ever before. I welcome the challenge!</p>

href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a>, according to <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1857552038390907299" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>. So what's the reason behind Xbox's sudden reclamation of the Call of Duty crown?

The panel has voted and this year's Game Awards nominations have been announced - with Astro Bot, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, and Balatro all looking like they could be in for a very merry Geoffmas come 12th December.
</p>
<p>
Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth are the big pre-winners, having both been shortlisted across seven categories for this year's Game Awards. Metaphor: ReFantazio, meanwhile, has secured nominations in six categories, with smash-hit poker roguelike Balatro and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s sublime Silent Hill 2 remake scoring five appearances apiece. 
</p>
<p>
Only four of those games feature in this year's Game of the Year shortlist, however, with Astro Bot, Balatro, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and Metaphor: ReFantazio all making the cut, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree. As for Silent Hill 2, its nominations are primarily audio and music-related, although it's also up for best narrative, and Luke Roberts has a well-deserved nomination for his portrayal of James Sutherland.

<p>
Away from triple-A, Animal Well, Balatro, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Neva, and UFO 50 are all up for best independent game, while Balatro (again!), Animal Well, Manor Lords, Pacific Drive, and The Plucky Squire have all been shortlisted for best debut indie game. Developer Odd Meter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indika-review">marvellous Indika</a> also puts in an extremely well-deserved appearance, albeit squished slightly awkwardly into the Games for Impact category, but there's absolutely no sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thank-goodness-youre-here-review">Thank Goodness You're Here</a> anywhere, which feels like a crime of the highest order.
</p><p>
You'll find the full list of Game Awards 2024 nominees below - and if you have particularly strong opinions on who should win, the public can vote across all categories <a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/">via The Game Awards website</a> (or via local platforms in China) starting today until 6pm PT on 11th December. This year's Game Awards are being broadcast live from Los Angeles on 12th December, and Eurogamer will be on hand to bring you the highlights, Hideo Kojima or otherwise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-ps-vr2-launch-delayed-to-march-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to IO Interactive’s latest announcement, Hitman World of Assassination’s PS VR2 launch has been delayed to March 27, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hitman: World of Assassination was initially scheduled to launch for PS VR2 in December 2024. However, a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from the developers indicates that they require additional time to enhance the game and ensure every aspect is “refined, immersive, and seamless.” The delay will also allow the developers to incorporate some new features for the PS VR2 version, including active reloading.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-s-entire-campaign-is-playable-on-ps-vr2">Hitman WOA’s Entire Campaign is Playable on PS VR2</h2>



<p>PS VR2 players can experience the entire Hitman: World of Assassination (WOA) campaign. This includes free exploration across 20 unique locations such as Dubai, Paris, Miami, and more. Players will also have access to over 100 items and weapons while completing missions, adding depth to their approach in each task.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-ps-vr2-features">Hitman WOA PS VR2 Features</h2>



<p>The most requested features for Hitman: World of Assassination on PS VR2 include dual-wielding and complete ambidexterity. The developers have confirmed that these features will be available at launch. Additionally, players can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as managing a guard while holding a weapon or picking up an essential item.</p>



<p>The new active reloading feature enables players to manually eject ammunition, grab a new magazine, and insert it back into their weapon, adding a layer of immersion to gear management. The PS VR2 version of the game offers a brand-new way to experience the franchise. Instead of pressing buttons to trigger events, players must physically mimic actions to complete tasks.</p>



<p>The developers are also taking “a more physics-based approach for disguising, where players can take an outfit using positional control, grabbing, and momentum, significantly enhancing the immersion and realism of the gameplay.”&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-steel-first-preview-a-medieval-fantasy-rpg-with-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks solid so far, but it also likely won’t strike you as anything you haven’t heard before. I was given a hands-off glimpse into this medieval fantasy action-RPG set in an unforgiving world, where your actions will shape the fate of an entire land. (See what I mean?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our session, I witnessed roughly 20 minutes of gameplay, followed by a Q&amp;A with the developers, Fire &amp; Frost – a studio formed with the express intention of making a game inspired by classic RPGs from the 2000s. Think The Witcher, Fable, and the Gothic series, amongst others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the beginning the developers stressed that there would be none of the UI or map markers you find in today’s games, which could be fun or painful depending on what kind of gamer you are. For me personally, this was one of the most exciting things about Of Ash and Steel – I immediately envisioned the joy (and sometimes frustration, but fun frustration) of getting hopelessly lost while trying to pinpoint an objective with next to no direction. Mankrik’s Wife, anyone?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this will work best if there are things to enjoy, even if you don’t find your objective right away. The developers promise there’ll be a lot of that, and I saw some hints of small joys. For instance, I giggled when the protagonist at one point tripped over a rock, that silly goose.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">“You look familiar…”</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, let’s discuss the guy whose skin we’re going to inhabit. He’s a capital-D Dude: stubbled, ripped, and wearing a perpetual smirk. And, as per the classic RPG formula, he starts as a nobody and has to work his way up into heroism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He looks oddly smooth and botoxed for a guy who gets into lots of fights – I saw NPCs whose features had more personality than our leading man’s. It didn’t help that the gameplay I saw didn’t have any voiceover yet – maybe, when voiced, Dude will become more likable. We’ll see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There sadly won’t be a female version of this playable character, however Dude will be lightly customizable (for example, you can change his hair). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m most entertained by the idea of knocking out all my enemies, tavern-brawl style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">His combat opponents range from garden-variety goblins to well-equipped bandits. The combat is standard RPG fare: hack-and-slash swordplay with a bit of archery thrown in. You can unlock new combat skills as you progress, allowing you to customize your playstyle – though I didn’t really have a clear idea of the possibilities. You can pick up rocks and bottles in the immediate environment, and I’m most entertained by the idea of knocking out all my enemies, tavern-brawl style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for those into more… “gritty” combat, don’t worry: there’s a kill cam.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A cozy world</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Non-combat activities are also available, such as crafting and fishing. Though I didn’t see it in action, it sounds like various forms of crafting may get pretty nuanced: you can make specific handles or blades for swords, for instance. Other money-making ventures include cooking, alchemy… and the good ol’ method of looting the bodies of your fallen foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers promise a “cozy” world, a design decision made so players didn’t get too lost without their quest markers. I definitely got a sense of that coziness from the forest, especially as the weather changed to rain, signaling time to set up camp and stay dry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw scenes in a forest and a town, but there will be other biomes to explore as well, like underwater caves. The soundtrack doesn’t just offer music for each setting, but variations on that music based on factors like time of day. Imagine soft morning sun filtering through forest leaves, the music swelling with the promise of a new day… or the soundtrack taking on a sinister tone as night falls.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers promise a “cozy” world, a design decision made so players didn’t get too lost without their quest markers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the narrative, details are scant. You’re in an island kingdom that was once prosperous. There are two main factions, and within them sub-factions, such as bounty hunters or smugglers. (Personally, I’m looking forward to becoming a Gravedigger – acquiring valuables in an… unconventional way.) You can make choices that “shape the world around you,” but I’m skeptical how much that will affect the overall ending. I hope to be pleasantly surprised.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What’s the story?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, I must state that this was a “hands-off” preview, and my thoughts are based on observation alone. Without being able to play a build myself, it’s difficult to determine if the combat will feel particularly awesome, or if the story will really leave a lasting impression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think that’s what will really anchor this experience: the story. There are hints of humor that I’m hoping will contrast, by the end, with a more epic tale of strife and survival. Right now I’d call this a game for RPG players to keep an eye on, but if the developers can really nail that story – and elevate the Dude beyond genericism – that’s what will distinguish Of Ash and Steel within the realm of medieval fantasy RPGs.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will launch in 2025 for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <span id="more-928455"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via tinyBuild:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to world where danger lurks around every corner, yet one that always rewards curiosity and courage.</p><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is an immersive third-person open-world RPG created by a passionate team that values the essence of classic old-school RPGs and modern designs. Explore the lands of a once-prosperous island, hone your combat skills, and survive in the unforgiving realm of the Kingdom of the Seven.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928450"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Rewarding World Exploration</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>‘s world is full of hidden treasures, underwater caves, side quests and bosses, and valuable loot. Some of these can be found with a treasure map, while others with pure luck. The game has no marker system, and quests won’t lead you by the hand. Rediscover the joy of exploration and let curiosity be your guide; the world promises rich rewards for those who dare to uncover its secrets.</li><li><strong>Deep Character Progression and World Evolution</strong> – Build your characters as you like with three different skill branches: <a title="Genres > Survival [352 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a>, Craftsmanship and War. Allocate your character’s attribute points and unlock passive bonuses by exploring the world. The social system makes your progression even more noticeable: As the hero’s skills grow, the world around him reacts differently. If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin, by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet.</li><li><strong>Rich Storytelling</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is set in the low-fantasy cruel medieval world. Make your path from abandoned lowlife to a marshal of fortunes, choose your side and forge alliances on your journey to discover the truth of who you really are.</li><li><strong>Methodical <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a> Combat</strong> – The combat system in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> allows players to use three different combat stances with unique combat styles for different weapons. You are not a Legendary powerful Hero by default in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>. You need to learn the ropes of becoming one! Learn to stand up for yourself by timing your attacks, using environments, and active skills. Invest in the War branch to become more skilled not just in numbers: attacks become more accurate and stronger, and you’ll learn more tricks. For example, you’ll be able to throw bottles from the ground to stun your opponents!</li><li><strong>Immersive Atmosphere</strong> – Players are encouraged to slow down and fully embrace the world around them. The richly detailed environment comes alive with a dynamic day-night cycle, shifting weather, and natural elements like wind that sways the trees. Ambient sounds—from the soft rustle of leaves to distant birdsong—enhance the immersion, while NPCs follow their own daily routines, adding to the sense of a living, breathing world. The result is an experience that wraps players in a comforting, tranquil atmosphere, inviting them to linger and explore at their own pace.</li><li><strong>When Classic Meets Modern</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is a game for everyone from hardcore RPG fans to casual players. It is inspired by classic old-school RPGs and combines the convenience of modern gaming while paying homage to the legendary classic <a title="Genres > RPG [16,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing games</a>. There are no quest markers or enemy auto-levelling, but there’s modern user interface, environment markers, tutorials, and much more.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

			<p>This morning saw the debut of the story trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion by <a href="https://wccftech.com/aliens-single-player-unreal-engine-5-game-survios-announced-pc-console-vr/">Survios, a leading VR developer</a>. They've created numerous award-winning VR games, such as Spirit Vector, Electronauts, and Zombies on the Holodeck. Their last game, Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions, was released in 2021 as a non-VR game, and now they're back to dip their toes into the VR pool. Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to release on December 19, 2024, on PlayStation VR2 and SteamVR. Those who use Meta platforms will have access to the game in early 2025, but the date for it isn't set in stone just yet. If you want to see what you can expect from Alien: Rogue Incursion, make sure to check out the story trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Story Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e69rk-zwZvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this upcoming title, you follow the story of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks and her AI companion Davis 01, as they have to undertake a life threatening mission into an infested research facility on planet Purdan. For those who are interested in the game, you can get an exclusive weapon and armor skin inspired by Alien: Romulus if you pre-order now. Additionally, for those who want a few more extra goodies, you can get the Deluxe Edition which comes with Blue Camo Armor and Weapon skins, as well as a digital artbook of Alien: Rogue Incursion. If you want to pre-order this title, you can get the Standard Edition of Alien: Rogue Incursion for $39.99, with the Deluxe Edition costing $49.99.</p>
<p>More details about Alien: Rogue incursion have been posted to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/alien-rogue-incursion-new-story-trailer-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a> by TQ Jefferson, the Chief Product Officer at Survios. In this post, he announces that the game has officially gone gold ahead of its release date next month, as well as the breakdown of how they created the trailer to immerse those interested in the game.</p>
<p>In the post, Jefferson goes on to mention that the Alien: Rogue Incursion trailer follows a classic three-act structure, with each act having a particular focus. Whether this means that the game has the same sort of structure is uncertain. The trailer introduces viewers to Zula and Davis 01, where they begin their journey into exploring the facility. As the trailer reaches act two, "we weave in classic Alien themes like corporate corruption, personal greed, and professional hubris, all of which create a perfect storm of conditions for a Xenomorph outbreak."</p>
<p>There are some traditional weapons that players will get access to, such as the M41 Prototype Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, and, of course, the Motion Tracker. If you're a horror nerd or really enjoy the Alien movies, check this game out when it releases on December 19, 2024.</p>

Even better, on Xbox Series X, PS5, and PS5 Pro you can play <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> in 4K resolution at 60 FPS.

			<p>Today, the official nominations for the Game of the Year category at The Game Awards 2024 have been <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1858558285995241601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1858558285995241601%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a>, and the biggest news is that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was included. This is surprising because Shadow of the Erdtree is not a standalone game but a DLC that requires Elden Ring to be played.</p>
<p>Since this is unprecedented, The Game Awards organization clarified its stance on the topic with a newly added FAQ on the event's official <a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</em></p>
<p>It's fair game for everyone, then, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the obvious favorite in an otherwise less-than-outstanding year. FromSoftware's admittedly large DLC (according to HowLongToBeat, it takes 25.5 hours for the main quest but over 50 hours for a completionist run) will have to beat Atlus's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Square Enix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and PlayStack's Balatro to repeat the 2022 win of the base game. It shouldn't be too hard, although on paper, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is tied with Astro Bot and Metaphor: ReFantazio when it comes to Metacritic score (94 for all three). However, FromSoftware's latest masterpiece is far more popular, as evidenced by the larger sales.</p>
<p>The DLC got a perfect score here on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo. Here's the summarized take from his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>It did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>You can vote for your favorite game on the official The Game Awards website. The ceremony will go live on December 12 at 5 PM Pacific.</p>
