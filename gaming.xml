            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/helldivers-2-pc-install-size-tiny-smaller/</link>
            <guid>1371676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is about to get much, much smaller on PC, as Arrowhead (with some help from PlayStation’s Nixxes) have worked hard to squish the game’s install down by a staggering 85%! That’s huge news for PC players… and those that just have the game installed, but haven’t actually played it in a while.</p>
<p>Available now as a beta update, this reduces the PC installation size from ~154GB to just ~23GB, a completely ridiculous reduction in size. You’ll still be on the same build of the game, just without taking up so much space. Neat!</p>


<p>How is this possible? Well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english">in a blog post recently</a>, Arrowhead addressed the issue of the game’s installation on PC and how much bigger it was than the PS5 version of the game. The reason for the difference was that, while the PS5 is guaranteed to have an SSD, Arrowhead thought that they needed to duplicate files to keep loading times down for PC gamer playing from a traditional mechanical HDD. After the reduction in size, Arrowhead believe that mission loading times for HDD players will be increased by just a few seconds in the worst cases.</p>
<p>All of this is because Arrowhead had relied on industry data for this assumption on data duplication – a practice that has been common to aid in random read times for any kind of spinning disc media. After exploring this in tandem with Nixxes and gathering real data specific to this game (such as that only 11% of players were playing from HDD), they discovered that the majority of loading times are actually from level generation as opposed to asset loading, meaning they could safely de-duplicate game assets, as asset loading happens in parallel.</p>

<p>While testing has been very positive internally, Arrowhead is still being cautious and hosting this as a beta alongside the main version, before reversing the roles and putting the huge version of Helldivers 2 as a legacy version to help with troubleshooting. However, given the minor differences, they won’t maintain this forever.</p>

            <p>Bloody waiters. Asking you what you'd like to eat after you waltz into the restaurant at which they're employed. The absolute cheek of it. Why can't they just ingest my money and spit a vaguely edible chocolate bar out of their belly button? This is the central philosophy which serves as the "touchstone" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> and its protagonist, Judas.</p>
<p>Yep, there's another <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/02/judas-developers-ghost-story-games-discuss-the-origins-of-its-main-character/">dev blog</a> out for the BioShocky FPS in which you'll run around a colony ship and gradually force someone to dislike you so much they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-successor-judas-emerges-from-hiding-as-ken-levine-explains-how-youll-choose-the-games-final-villain">go full villain</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This time, Levine and co focus on the game's protagonist, who's called Judas. No, not the dude from the last supper, Judas is a lady who's lived her life on the game's spaceship, The Mayflower, and has had a lot of bad experiences interacting with its inhabitants. She also isn't a fan of going out for dinner.</p>
<p>As Levine recalls, when the team were trying to nail down just who Judas would be as a character, he was out for a run and cam,e up with a "speech" she might give. Said speech came to form "the touchstone we kept coming back to for the character and ultimately the entire game", and it went as follows:</p>
<blockquote>I only eat at vending machines, because I don’t like interacting with waiters. Restaurants are more complicated: there are greetings and "hellos" and "Is this table okay?" And I’m thinking, "Why should I care what you recommend? You’re not me!" But I’m not supposed to say that, so I just have to count the seconds until the interaction can end, devise socially acceptable ways of saying "Go f*** yourself." Because for me, conversation is a prelude to failure. Vending machines never ask me a question that I don’t know the answer to. The exchange is reduced to the transaction: money in, product out. Why can’t people be more like that?”</blockquote>
<p>Basically, Judas likes machines more than people. As someone who gets a bit of social anxiety when chatting to strangers, I get it, though I can't say I feel fuck off levels of strongly about waiters who're just politely trying to find me a table. According to Ghost Story Games, it's the "tension" between the robot-heavy sci-fi setting playing into Judas' hands, while her inability to play by societal rules leaves her a "pariah" or "outlaw" that forms the centre of the game, which its creators have taken to calling a "Judas Simulator".</p><p>The devs also stress that Judas' deep connection to the game's setting sets her apart from BioShock and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> leads Jack and Booker DeWitt, both of whom are strangers infiltrating unfamiliar worlds. I'm keen to see just how well that familiarity's played, with Ghost Story art director Nathan Phail-Liff's description of The Mayflower as being layered with history reflecting the twists and turns of the society inhabiting it over the years. Systems are being leaned on to manage the enivronment design in a fashion that means not everything'll be handcrafted, which'll be impressive if Ghost Story have pulled it off, but I'm slightly concerned could also imbue the game with the sterile coldness which can seep into game worlds which lean on tech like procedural generation particularly hard.</p>
<p>Breathtaking and twisted underwater city Rapture's the main thing that regularly pulls me back into BioShock, so here's hoping The Mayflower can capture some of that magic. If it does, I can't see my divergence from Judas' hardline waiter stance being a stumbling block.</p>

              <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a world where AI is increasingly sneaking into our games. Free-to-play multiplayer Steam hit <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is one of the latest examples, using an LLM-based chatbot for many of its NPCs that players can talk with. Or flirt with. Or “socially” engineer into completing quests without actually doing the work by talking to them like Solid Snake.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665">Open-World RPG <i>Where Winds Meet</i> Has It All: Evil Geese, AI Chatbots, And A $40,000 Skin</a></p> <p>Developed by Chinese-based Everstone Studio, <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is a veritable Mulligan stew of countless modern gaming conventions, as well as AI NPCs that trade scripted, canned lines of dialogue for, in theory anyway, a more dynamic and unpredictable experience. Others might describe it as lifeless. I’m inclined to agree, but the tech isn’t without its amusing quirks and exploits. One such player seems to have proven this by flirting with the tech until it…well, it did something <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pd0pgi/removed_by_moderator/?embed_host_url=https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">raunchy enough for a Reddit mod to take it down</a> (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>).</p> <p>Though the screenshot taken by Reddit user Oglokes24 is now in horny jail, we can glean some context clues from the comments. The flirting seemed to involve Okglokes24 lying to an NPC to say that “her husband died” and, well, whatever it was, one user replied: “You should be locked up.” “Sex minigame when?” reads another comment. “Ban incoming,” states another.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Oglokes24 about the contents of the now-deleted screenshot.</p> <h2>AI…Chatbots?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/chatgpt-ai-discord-clyde-chatbot-exploit-jailbreak-1850352678">Since LLMs hit the web</a>, folks have been finding all sorts of ways to trick them into doing things they’re not supposed to. Insert that tech into a game, and it’s no surprise that people are finding ways to get it to do things it’s not really supposed to. That includes some clever players realizing that if you talk to <i>Where Winds Meet</i>’s AI chatbots as Solid Snake would, by restating various phrases back to the NPC as a question, you can bypass certain quest win conditions.</p> <p>In a Reddit post documenting the so-called “<i>Metal Gear</i> method” (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/where-winds-meet/npc-chatbots-gaming">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), a user was able to end a quest just by rephrasing everything the NPC said back as a question.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000650075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650075"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650075">© Screenshot: Everstone Studio / Hakkix</figcaption></figure> <p>Based on comments from other players, the tech behind these pseudo-sentient NPCs isn’t as sophisticated as something like ChatGPT, so it’s a bit easier to find ways to screw with it. While I admit the prospect of interacting with NPCs via natural language is neat, I certainly am unwilling to trade thoughtful, well-written characters for this junk.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BACKBONE ONE Review—Small But Mighty for Mobile Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/backbone-one-review-mobile-gaming/</link>
            <guid>1371655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I’ve never been a huge mobile gamer, but I can fully appreciate that it makes up a <strong>massive </strong>portion of our industry. In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly intelligent, and AAA titles are finding their way onto mobile devices both natively and via cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that, if you want to enjoy mobile gaming as much as possible, you’ll want a solid controller with which to do so. That’s where the BACKBONE ONE comes in, an innovative, handy, and powerful little device that holds your phone and provides a solid base on which to build a strong mobile gaming experience.</p>



<p>I’ve been trialling the BACKBONE ONE for a couple of weeks and have been nothing but impressed. Here’s my full BACKBONE ONE review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-backbone-one-worth-99-99">Is The BACKBONE ONE Worth $99.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this BACKBONE ONE review, the device was selling for $99.99. I’d picked up the ultra-limited Death Stranding 2 edition, which came in a fabulous themed box and boasted a unique shell that’s to die for, but the standard is much more accessible and easier to find online.</p>



<p>As I write this, the <a href="https://backbone.com/pages/death-stranding-2-le">Death Stranding 2 edition</a> is fully sold out, but BACKBONE has teased that another wave might arrive soon. If you’re a fan, you’ll want to secure one of these, as it’s a gorgeous item to have in your collection, even if you don’t actively play mobile games.</p>



<figure><figcaption>My BACKBONE ONE Death Stranding 2 Edition is a beautiful thing.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Now, to the BACKBONE ONE review.</p>



<p>The BACKBONE ONE is a relatively simple thing that works right out of the box with almost no setup required. You simply pull it apart, insert your mobile device, and snap it closed again. It has a USB-C connection (or a Lightning connection) built into the device, which means it works with almost all modern devices.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market and looking to make known your allegiances, you’ll be happy to know you can purchase the BACKBONE ONE in both an Xbox or PlayStation-based theme.</p>



<p>It basically takes your phone and turns it into a cheap, portable gaming device, which, when paired with something like Game Pass, becomes a formidable thing. It’s small but mighty, and while the inputs and the overall form factor are pretty tiny compared to something like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, it’s perfect for gaming on the go.</p>



<p>In recent years, BACKBONE has evolved this device, and now, there’s a handy app, more responsive inputs, magnetic adapters that ensure a better fit for a wider range of devices, and more tactile buttons. There’s even a nice 3.5mm headset jack on the side if you want to game on a train or while sitting in an Uber.</p>



<p>It really is that simple.</p>



<p>I’d say it’s worth $99.99, without a doubt. If you want to game while travelling and don’t want to splash out almost $1,000 on a top-tier handled gaming device, this is where you’ll want to get involved. It weighs almost nothing, shrinks down into the tiniest space in your backpack (or even a pocket), and it looks nice.</p>



<p>It’s also durable, which I’ve tested by aggressively pulling it open and shut again and dropping it a few times. There’s very little in the way of working parts inside the BACKBONE ONE, so you don’t have to worry about it being devastated by a slip of the hand. Just try to make sure your phone isn’t in it when you do drop it, because that’s not guaranteed to be protected.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing I can complain about, it’s that my ‘armoured’ phone protector couldn’t fit properly in the BACKBONE ONE as the charging port was a bit obscured, but that’s a ‘me’ problem.</p>



<p>I’d recommend the BACKBONE ONE if you want to game on the go on the cheap; it’s that simple.</p>







<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your favorite mobile game is and if you’d buy the BACKBONE ONE.</p>

        <p>After your father’s passing, you inherit the apartment he left behind.</p><p>Then one day, a mysterious man appears with a warning for you—the new landlord:</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>From that moment on, your journey to uncover the cleverly disguised Yokai begins.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>A social deduction adventure where monsters wear human faces.</p><p>This is a social deduction adventure game where you, as the landlord, must uncover Yokai who are blending in among your apartment’s tenants by gathering clues and presenting evidence.</p><p>The game is a single narrative divided into multiple chapters.

                <p>Late last month, Santa Ragione, the developer behind the indie horror game Horses, revealed that its title had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">banned by Steam in 2023</a> while the game was still in development. The game had been set to release on Epic Games Store this week, but now Epic has banned Horses as well.</p><p>Santa Ragione shared <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy statement on its site</a>, as well as reproduced messages from Epic that broke the news about the cancellation a day before launch. The dispatch from Epic cites violations of its inappropriate content policy and hateful or abusive content policies. Epic also stated that Horses got an Adults Only rating, and those games are excluded from the store.</p><p>In response, Santa Ragione mentioned that Epic approved the game for release just over three weeks ago, and that the actual rating for the game was M for Mature under the ESRB and PEGI 18 in international territories. The studio went on to explain again that Horses is not a sexually charged adult game.</p><p>"We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels, stating clearly that the game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," reads the statement from Santa Ragione. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera. And finally, we explained that the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general."</p><p>Although Santa Ragione was given an opportunity to appeal, the judgment was quickly upheld and now the game is banned from the two biggest PC storefronts... and possibly a third as well. Horses had been set to be released on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Store</a>, but the listing now redirects away from the game's page and it doesn't appear to be listed on that site any longer. GameSpot has reached out to Humble for comment.</p><p>Santa Ragione previously disclosed that it invested $100,000 in the development of Horses, and that it may close as a result of being locked out of Steam. Getting banned from Epic may have made the studio's situation even more difficult. Regardless, Horses is now available for $5 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a>. And while it's not an adults-only game, some aspects of it are very disturbing. The horses at the center of the game aren't really horses at all. They're people who have been forced to wear horse masks and live like a horse.</p>

            <p>Fresh footage of Resident Evil Requiem was shown on Japanese television, and it's very reminiscent of classic series gameplay.</p>
<p>The footage was part of a special programme, and has been shared on social media by series insider Dusk Golem.</p>
<p>It's only thirty seconds long, but it shows protagonist Grace Ashcroft exploring a creepy mansion in third-person, shooting at zombies before being grabbed and nibbled on.</p>

<p>It's not much to go on, admittedly, and that description alone probably sounds incredibly trite. But it does suggest a return to the sort of gameplay and setting that made Resident Evil such a popular series, which will be music to the ears of longtime fans.</p>
<p>Specifically, it looks very reminiscent of Resident Evil 1 - although that's likely not the iconic Spencer Mansion we'll be exploring.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Dusk Golem clarified the footage will be from a censored Japanese version, which typically censors headshots and dismemberment, for example.</p>
<p>The mainline series has strayed from its roots somewhat from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> onwards, experimenting with new settings, new perspectives, and new protagonists. Resident Evil Requiem, meanwhile, seems to be attempting to appease a wide spectrum of fans: there's a new protagonist, but linked to the older games; it allows players to shift between first and third-person perspectives; and it returns to Racoon City at last. </p>
<p>Now we know there's a new mansion to explore, to boot.</p>
<p>Further, producer Masato Kumazawa <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who">confirmed characters from previous games in the series will return</a>, though told fans not to "over-expect or hype it". Fans have long been speculating the return of series favourite Leon Kennedy, but we still don't know for sure if he'll appear.</p>

<p>Gardener's World</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We were delighted to see Ustwo Games' gorgeous mobile puzzler, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley 3</a>, make the jump to Switch earlier this year, and today the dev has given us even more story chapters to sink our teeth into — <em>for free</em>!</p>
<p>The 'Garden of Life' expansion is now available on Switch, bolting four additional chapters onto the end of the main game, packed with even more of the series' signature perspective-bending puzzles. There are even some hidden optional puzzles to find in the bonus levels, for those after even more.</p>
<p>The expansion drop accompanies the news that MV3 is now back on mobile, so you can check out all the extra content wherever you please.</p>
<p>If the above trailer didn't do enough to sell you on the new freebie, here's a statement on what you can expect from the expansion by lead designer Emily Brown, and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am really pleased to be able to share these new chapters and puzzles, because<br>
they bring together the skills of an incredible team who care deeply about what<br>
they make. After the events of the main game, we wanted The Garden of Life to<br>
tell a story of people coming together to build a new future. A story of hope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll find Monument Valley 3 and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_1and2_bundle">previous two series entries</a> on the Switch eShop right now. Those who want to experience the full trilogy from start to finish can even pick up the collection in physical form from <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/monument-valley-the-trilogy-nintendo-switch-exclusive-edition">iam8bit</a>.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time with Monument Valley 3 earlier this year. Despite our confusion around the lack of touch controls at launch, we stated that the game "lives up to its predecessors as an excellent little puzzler with mind-tickling structures and stunning presentation sewn together with a delicate narrative thread" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/monument-valley-iii">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Soulslike is dead. The age of the Souplike has begun. Indie developer Kite Line has just published Soup Rooms - a sequel of sorts to dong yarhalla's <a href="https://yh.16dimensional.com/soup/">videogame concept album</a> from 2007, in which you visit small square rooms with feverdream aesthetics and a peculiar entity in the middle.
</p>
<p>
What was I doing back in 2007? Alas, I was not playing Soup. There's a high probability that I <em>cooked</em> soup in 2007, but it wouldn't have been very interesting soup. It would not have featured any spirit wolves, whiny fallen clouds, consumptive Casio men, "boinglers", or Willem Dafoes.

<p>
Available <a href="https://kiteline.itch.io/soup-rooms">for free on Itch</a>, Soup Rooms features contributions from such leftfield big bananas as Mike Klubnika (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>), Modus Interactive (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armored-shell-nightjar">Armored Shell Nightjar</a>), and scumhead (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/franzen">Franzen</a>). The new rooms were created using Kira's tool <a href="https://akuma-kira.itch.io/bap">Bapalon</a>, which lets even people with no gamedev or programming experience (hello!) devise their "own small walkable spaces that link together to showcase different art, atmospheres, and music".
</p><p>
There's nothing to do in the rooms save orbiting the central sprite,  sizing up the inevitably mind-boingling decor, and listening to the audio, which varies from vapourwave licks to DECtalk bedtime stories about wireframe dogs. I say "nothing to do" but I have spent 30 minutes in the room with Willem Dafoe doing the splits while gazing at you intently. It is hard to leave a room in which Willem Dafoe is doing the splits while gazing at you intently. Those thighs... they refuse to let go.
</p>
<p>
I had no idea about Soup Rooms before catching Kite Line's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kiteline.bsky.social/post/3m6rsibyjm22r">Bluesky announcement post</a>. I may never need another game. Disappointed by a room? Simply drift through the wall to the next. Weary of soup? Perhaps you will prefer exploring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wikipedia-is-now-an-endless-3d-museum-and-admission-is-free">an endless museum generated from Wikipedia entries</a>. See if you can find the entry for Soup Rooms, even. There's probably a lot of fascinating development history I'm missing.

              <p>I’m a humble man with simple needs. It turns out what I really look for in games is a really good bumpity-bumpity-bumpity noise while sliding down a flight of stairs. If it weren’t already <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">packed with a squillion other good reasons</a>, this would still be enough on its own to have me booting up <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <p>Let’s not mince words: sliding down a flight of stairs is great. From bumping down the carpeted steps on my bottom as a child, to launching myself down headfirst on a sleeping bag as a teenager, it’s an ideal way to spend a wet afternoon before a trip to the ER. As an adult, however, my significantly less resilient frame tends to object to such antics, and falling down the stairs has become the stuff of nightmares, likely to bruise a bone such that I’ll complain for a month. So thank goodness for <em>Arc Raiders</em> and its simulation of the joyful action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650070">© Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Arc</em>, like so many first- and third-person shooters, when you hit the crouch/crawl button while sprinting, it plunges your character into a sliding skid that is primarily programmed into most games to look cool. However, in Embark Studio’s extraction shooter, the action has multiple benefits. First and foremost, there’s the looking cool, but beyond this, skidding is a fast way to descend hills without draining your stamina. In fact, you can actually regain stamina during a skid, and when well-timed, it’s the perfect means of escape from a feisty gang of angry drones. Run, crouch, and slide down the dusty slopes, then regain enough energy to sprint off into a nearby doorway at the bottom.</p>

 <p>But it’s not until you attempt this move at the top of a flight of steps, whether they’re in a concrete bunker or from a metal walkway, that you discover the utter life-affirming joy that’s on offer here. Sliding down steps is the smoothest, most satisfying movement in a video game since&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning</em>‘s forward roll. Its perfection is a combination of factors that I shall lay out for you, scientifically:</p>

 <ol> <li>It’s not just a gimmick, but a very effective means of movement, especially when trying to escape danger</li> <li>It’s an uninterrupted and effortless slide with no tiresome movement penalty at the end</li> <li>You go “ba-dada, ba-dada, ba-dada” as you bump down the stairs at such speed in the most rewarding aural element in all of gaming history</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes when I’m playing, I’ll see other players just running down stairs and not sliding, and I worry. I worry that either they&nbsp;<em>don’t know</em>, and thus the vital necessity of this article. Or far, far worse, they&nbsp;<em>do&nbsp;</em>know and yet choose not to. These are broken people, and we need to have a way to report them not for bad play, but for the emotional support they so desperately deserve.</p> <p><em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ stair slides are a deep pleasure in difficult times, a sublime all-rewarding action that delivers both function and form, and it would be a sin against all that is positive not to celebrate them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-flex-bluetooth-speaker-drops-to-all-time-low-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-options-2000650056</link>
            <guid>1371613</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is still running Cyber Monday prices well into December, so people who missed the first sales rush can still get the <strong>Bose SoundLink Flex</strong> at a lower price. This portable <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/">Bluetooth speaker is now $119 instead of the regular $149 price</a>&nbsp;which means that premium Bose audio is now available at a mid-range price, where you would normally find speakers with bad sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Sound</h2>
<p>The SoundLink Flex has PositionIQ sensors that can tell if you’ve put the speaker upright, flat, or hanging from its utility loop. It then automatically changes the audio output to keep the sound quality at its best no matter how the speaker is positioned. This awareness of space is important because speaker drivers send sound in a certain direction, and what sounds balanced when you’re standing up can sound muddy or thin when the speaker tips over. The onboard processing changes the audio profile in real time, so the speaker works the same whether it’s on a picnic table, in your shower, or clipped to your backpack while you hike.</p>
<p>Bose designed the acoustics around a custom transducer and two passive radiators that give the small enclosure (3.6 by 7.9 by 2.1 inches) a surprising bass response. The passive radiators vibrate in sync with the active driver, which makes the low-frequency output go beyond what the small cabinet volume would normally produce. This bass emphasis doesn’t drown out the mids and highs because Bose tuned the frequency response to keep vocals and instruments clear even at high volumes. With complex music, you’ll be able to hear the different parts clearly instead of everything blending together into a mushy mess like cheaper portable speakers do.</p>



<p>The IP67 rating means that this speaker is truly waterproof, not just splash-proof like many of its competitors claim. It can also protect against dust and submersion up to one meter deep for 30 minutes. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the faucet or let it float in the pool without worrying about water damage. The outside is covered in silicone, which protects against scratches, rust, and UV damage when the device is outside for a long time.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 5.3 lets you connect to your paired device wirelessly up to 30 feet away and uses less power than older versions of Bluetooth. This helps the battery last longer between charges, up to 12 hours. Bluetooth 5.3 has more bandwidth, which means that audio compression artifacts that can make sound tinny or distorted on lower-quality speakers are less likely to happen. With multipoint pairing, two devices can connect at the same time. This means that you and a friend can take turns controlling music without having to keep disconnecting and reconnecting through Bluetooth settings.</p>



<p>The speaker charges through USB-C instead of the older micro-USB standard which means you can use the same cable that charges new phones and laptops to charge the speaker. The battery can charge quickly to a partial charge when you need to leave but forgot to charge it overnight. The speaker is only 1.3 pounds, so you can easily fit it in a daypack without adding too much weight or bulk.</p>
<p>The SoundLink Flex is a strong competitor with brands that can’t match its combination of sound quality and durability because it costs $119, which is a lot less than what you’d normally pay for Bose audio quality. The $30 off might not seem like much compared to some holiday deals, but Bose doesn’t often offer big discounts on its speakers, so any price drop is important.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> have been just as big without <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-2025-new-releases-doom-fable-ninja-gaiden-1851746651">a Game Pass deal</a>? Sandfall creative director creative director Guillaume Broche doesn’t seem to think so. On Wednesday, Microsoft crowned the RPG its most popular third-party Game Pass launch of 2025, and Broche thinks the marketing and word-of-mouth from subscribers trying the game for free helped propel it to being one of the year’s biggest hits.</p> <p>“Fresh from sweeping the Golden Joysticks and poised to do the same at The Game Awards, Sandfall Interactive’s phenomenal debut RPG is one of the most buzzed-about releases of the year, so it should surprise no one when we announce that <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;is the biggest new third-party game launch on Xbox Game Pass of 2025,” Microsoft announced <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">in a new blog post</a>. “That’s based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of its availability, which means a huge number of Xbox players joined Maelle, Gustave, Esquie, and the gang on their journey right from the beginning.”</p>

 <p>If that sounds a bit like Xbox trying to steal some credit for the game’s success, Broche doesn’t seem to think it’s completely unwarranted. “From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players,” he said.</p>

 <p>Being on Game Pass also let “a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before.” The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans, but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off. Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first.”</p>

 <p>That was back in April when Game Pass was still just $20 a month. If <em>Clair Obscur</em> were coming out today, players would need to shell out <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">$30 a month</a> to have that same barrier to entry lowered. The Game Awards frontrunner is a good example of a Game Pass deal working out for everyone involved, but is it just the exception that proves the rule? As the service gets more expensive and deals for most indie releases get smaller, it’s unclear if Game Pass can keep a good thing going or will <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">continue to enshitify</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft says the service is profitable and generated $5 billion in revenue, but it also hasn’t released new subscriber numbers in over a year. Maybe the platform will land another <em>Clair Obscur</em>-sized hit out of nowhere in 2026, or maybe this year will be remembered as the one that Game Pass peaked in.</p>

<p>No Man’s Sky creator has recently responded to Once Human, allegedly using their assets in a premium loot box, stating, “jokes on them.” </p>



<p>Hello Games No Man’s Sky was released all the way back in 2016, but has still been going strong almost a decade later. The developers recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-patch-notes-improved-ship-building-space-wrecks-salvaging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new update</a> for the title, introducing improved shipbuilding, space wrecks, salvaging, and more. Once Human, on the other hand, is a more recent title, releasing in 2024. However, Once Human was recently accused of ripping off assets from No Man’s Sky, and the founder has responded. </p>







<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-founder-says-jokes-on-them-in-response-to-once-human-allegedly-ripping-off-assets">No Man’s Sky Founder Says ‘Jokes on Them’ in Response to Once Human Allegedly Ripping Off Assets</h2>

The user has revealed that Once Human’s cosmetic item, Sky King, looks very similar to No Man’s Sky’s Teleport Module. The item from Once Human can only be obtained as the highest-tier reward from a premium lootbox, whereas in No Man’s Sky, you can acquire the item just by progressing through the game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post caught the attention of Hello Games founder Sean Murray, who responded on <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Murray stated, “jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets,” with an image of the asset in question. For those wondering, LOD stands for Level of Detail, a process in game development that optimises performance by displaying simpler versions of 3D models when they are far from the camera. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has announced that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has set the record as the best third-party title to release on Xbox Game Pass in 2025, adding a further accolade to Sandfall Interactive’s debut title.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is widely regarded to be one of the best games to release this year, with the expectation that it will sweep up numerous victories in The Game Awards next week, and the Game Pass record shows just how impressive the release of the title was.</p>







<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-game-pass-best-third-party-title-of-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is Game Pass’ Best Third-Party Title of 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft’s announcement of Clair Obscur’s impressive accolade detailed how it was based on the data of the number of unique players who played the title in the first 30 days of launch.</p>



<p>Sandfall’s creative director, Guillaume Broche, said the success was “so far beyond what any of us could have imagined,” detailing how nerve-wracking it was to release a title, but the “support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream.”</p>



<p>Broche also thanked Xbox and Game Pass for their support, noting that the game’s addition to the service allows people to “try our game when they might not have before,” particularly as the turn-based RPG genre can be off-putting for newcomers.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several major honors at The Game Awards</a>, having been nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, Best Audio Design, Best Independent Game, Besty Debut Indie Game, and Best Role-Playing Game, while Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr make up half of the contenders for Best Performance.</p>

Jennifer Hale, probably best known as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy, previously provided the voice for Samus in the first three Metroid Prime games. But for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Erin Yvette voices the protagonist and Krystle Martin provides the motion capture, per <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-credits-reveal-a-plethora-of-assist-devs-including-next-level-games">Nintendo Life</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Yvette has worked with Nintendo.

"I don't know," Hale said. "I have no recollection of recording it or signing a contract, so it could be no." Hale has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-3-actor-says-she-was-thrown-under-the-bus-after-recasting/1100-6536607/" data-ref-id="1100-6536607">on the flip side of this before, too, with Bayonetta 3</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass this year, with game director Guillaume Broche stating the subscription service allowed the studio to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The stat, shared on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">Xbox Wire</a>, is based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of the game's availability, meaning it made an immediate impact on the service.</p>
<p>"This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it's down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality," said Broche. "It's really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream."</p>

<p>Broche added the game's inclusion on Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before".</p>
<p>He continued: "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realise there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren't expecting it at first."</p><p>Expedition 33 also released on PC and PlayStation 5 at the same time as its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass. In its first three days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">the game sold a million copies</a>. It then reached the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">fitting milestone of 3.3m copies in a month</a>; most recently, the studio announced it had sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats. Presumably, the number of overall players is even larger thanks to Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">stiff competition at launch with the surprise release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which also released on Game Pass. However, publisher Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>
<p>Xbox will be keen for positivity around Game Pass following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike earlier this year</a>. And while Expedition 33 is a success for the subscription, without actual numbers it's hard to ascertain how it compares with other platforms. Still, it's further proof <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-xbox-game-pass-dies-then-well-have-lost-one-of-gamings-best-tools-for-discovery">Game Pass remains a great tool for discovery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">An update is in the works for Expedition 33</a>, which Broche teased to Eurogamer will have "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">reflected on the game's success</a>, stating the team is "incredibly moved and grateful at how big [the game] got and how it emotionally resonated with people".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released an update for their wheelchair basketball multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. Patch 1.2.0 adds a new game mode for the full game, while also revamping the Global Jam beta test into a regular demo for all to try.</p>
<p>The new game mode is Survival Tag, which is basically exactly what it sounds like. Survival Tag can be played throughout the park lobby with friends, local wireless and LAN, and needs to be started by the lobby host from the X menu.</p>


<p>Elsewhere there’s just some general bug fixed and improvements to the game, which are outlined in the patch notes below.</p>
<p>As for the demo, this allows you to check out the game offline, playing the tutorial, challenging bots in 3v3 matches, and exploring the park. You’ll generally be able to get used to the Joy-Con 2 mouse mode controls and how they work to play the game.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see the game getting some support still, but will it entice any new players to really dive into the game? Looking back on our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/drag-x-drive-review/">Drag x Drive</a>, I said, “Drag x Drive makes good use of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for a simple game of wheelchair basketball, but it lacks the charm and personality you’d expect from a Nintendo game.”</p>

<p>Here’s the full Drag x Drive 1.2.0 patch notes:</p>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the chasing game Survival Tag to friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: To play Survival Tag when in the parks listed above, the player who created the park opens the X Menu, then selects <strong>Start Survival Tag</strong> on the Players tab.</li>
<li>Depending on the wireless environment, there may be times where player positioning does not perfectly match between users. For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats. Previously, it counted the total number of Isos, not just wins.</li>
<li>Added Rope Jumps to Other Stats tab under Stats.</li>
<li>Changed the target of the Focus Cam when near the sumo ring to the sumo ring itself.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to bots in friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: We slightly lowered the strength level of the Easy and Standard bots that the player who created the park can add under the Players tab of the X Menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a feature to enable players to delete their own records.
<ul>
<li>On the screen that displays players’ records before starting time trials or shooting contests, simultaneously press and hold the ZL Button, left directional button, and right directional button on the Joy-Con 2 (L) for 10 seconds to delete the record.</li>
<li>Once deleted, records cannot be restored.</li>
<li>Obtained trophies will remain, even if records are deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a very rare issue where, due to unintended behavior, the displays for level or total distance would reach the upper limit.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue in Circuit Sprint where players sometimes passed through terrain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bunny hops made it possible to accelerate to and maintain speed that exceeded top speed.
<ul>
<li>The intended design is that it is only possible to accelerate beyond the normal top speed when driving down a slope or successfully pulling off a halfpipe or ramp trick. However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed. We fixed this because this issue required players to control their character in unintuitive ways in order to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Version 1.1.1 for the <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em> (formerly <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em>) was also released.</p>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed software title from <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> to <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em>.</li>
<li>Changed the software icon that displays in locations such as the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>Made it possible to play the tutorial and certain bot games any time.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[MLB The Show Mobile Announced, Out Now In the Philippines]]></title>

			<p>Sony and San Diego Studio are bringing MLB The Show to iOS and Android devices with MLB The Show Mobile. Published by Sony and developed by San Diego Studios, it's already available, though only in the Philippines. It's getting a limited regional release to start, and will roll out globally as development on the game expands.</p>



<p>The free-to-play mobile game will be "<em>a new standalone experience built from the ground up to deliver realistic baseball gameplay on mobile devices</em>," <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">according to the game's website</a>. If you're keen to swing for the fences with MLB The Show Mobile but you don't live in the Philippines, you can sign up on the website to receive an email when it is available in your region.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases a bit of gameplay and the touch-control-optimized user interface. It also shows a bit of the card system, where players will be able to collect cards and create their all-star team, which will also likely be where the game makes its money.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Preview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctcq_G3UclA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This is the latest mobile venture for Sony, and it's arguably the one that makes the most sense. Baseball lends itself to mobile devices better than other sports and definitely better than some of the other intellectual properties in Sony's portfolio. It's also the latest platform expansion for MLB The Show, which was the first PlayStation exclusive title <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-early-march-2024-mlb-the-show-24-control/">to make the jump over to Xbox </a>after the MLB forced the issue to make it happen. </p>



<p>The limited regional release is perhaps the most interesting aspect of this. It feels like Sony and San Diego Studio are trying to take their time before bringing it elsewhere, like the United States, which is, of course, a significant chunk of the baseball market. Though this could just be a quick test ahead of a global launch that'll <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/">coincide with the release of MLB The Show 26</a>, which will arrive somewhere in its regular window of early 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-remake-dragon-quest-yuji-horii-rpg-2000650055</link>
            <guid>1371547</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Chrono Trigger</em> is very special. It’s a bold and beautiful RPG assembled by some of the best developers working in gaming at the time. Perhaps just as importantly, it holds up remarkably well for a game that <a href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-jrpg-snes-30th-anniversary-square-1851769192">released on the SNES over 30 years ago</a>. Go play it right now if you haven’t. I promise you it sill looks great, sounds amazing, and packs a neat, evocative, one-of-a-kind story into an incredibly streamlined but satisfying time-travelling structure. I mention all this because <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-changes-horii-gender-elon-musk-1851665687"><em>Dragon Quest</em> creator Yuji Horii</a>, who was also one of the writers on <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, is once again playing coy about Square Enix’s plans for a remake.</p> <p>“I can’t talk about that,” Horii said on the latest episode of the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA&amp;t=6628s">KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku</a>‘ talk show livestream (translated by&nbsp;<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>) when asked if <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5Edfec9381ad5a12d366a05615b17599a5209267ae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">anniversary events</a> for the SNES classic might be leading up to a bigger project. He continued to say he couldn’t talk about it in a way that heavily implied there was something to talk about. “Wait, if I say that, you’ll figure it out!” he added, followed by “Don’t ask!” and “I’ll get in trouble!”</p>

 <h2>Square Enix is in the middle of a remaster frenzy</h2> <p>This might feel like a bit of smoke with no fire if not for the fact that Horii has done this before. At Napoli Comicon, the designer appeared to let slip that <em>Chrono Trigger</em> was getting a remake before following it up with “You have heard nothing.” There <a href="https://x.com/buzz_95b/status/1918366504048804155">was video</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/1kd11di/comment/mq7liqb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">first-hand accounts from attendees</a>, but it was all a bit messy to parse due to the translations and loud audience reactions. Square Enix later <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1923998070309781720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923998070309781720%7Ctwgr%5E96578349a12f5ffb6114b601fc5b0fd5fd94b346%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Frpg%2Fit-is-a-mistranslation-regarding-a-chrono-trigger-remake-says-square-enix-further-dashing-hopes-of-a-new-version-of-the-iconic-rpg-30-years-after-its-release%2F">followed up</a> to say that Horii had been “mistranslated,” which only convinced fans the remake was even more real.</p>

 <p>But while I absolutely believe at this point that Square Enix is working on something related to <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, what exactly it will be and when, if ever, it’ll see the light of day, is harder to pin down. Square Enix has released all sorts of remasters and remakes running from simple HD updates (<em>Chrono Cross</em>) to HD-2D glow-ups (<em>Dragon Quest III Remake</em>) to complete 3D overhauls (<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>). There’s even Horii’s own upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-7-remake-ps1-switch-2-graphics-chrono-trigger-2000625721"><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></a>, which falls somewhere between those last two categories.</p>

 <p>In other words, <em>Chrono Trigger</em> could get a straightforward <em>Pixel Perfect</em>-style upgrade or a full-blown reimagining. My money’s on something simpler. Square Enix has shown a desire to remain pretty conservative when tampering with its classics, and doesn’t necessarily <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">have the resources</a> to be throwing at a more ambitious remake. Then there’s the fact that things like a rumored remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-anniversary-merch-rpg-1851773483"><em>Final Fantasy IX</em> are still MIA</a>. As it pulls from its back catalog, Square Enix seems a bit less predictable with what will come out when and in what form.</p>

 <h2>Yes,<em> Chrono Trigger</em> really is that good</h2> <p>Maybe there’s also a little bit of trepidation with trying to “improve” on what’s widely considered to be one of the all-time greats. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> game director Brandon Adler was recently gushing about the game with zero caveats. “Let’s just take the actual visuals and the music on that thing,” Adler said on a recent episode of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/04fCqmmagL4Nz56PAMcvA4?"><em>My Perfect Console</em></a>. “Just aesthetically, the game is gorgeous on so many different fronts. I can still hear the music. The characters, they made such an impact, and they did such interesting things, even in terms of the actual systems behind them, like the [techniques] that were being used.”</p>

 <p>He also complimented the pacing which remains unmatched in the genre. “It doesn’t get enough credit for, although I think the real RPG heads will know this, is the pacing on it is just amazing,” he said. “It’s one of the only JRPGs I can think of where you don’t actually have to grind. You can just play through the entire experience and you don’t have to worry about that aspect of JRPGs. Which, some people like that, but also it’s a grind.”</p> <p>This is the kind of stuff people think about when they call <em>Chrono Trigger</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-the-kotaku-review-1826393914">a “perfect” game</a>, and the kind of thing that would be easy to mess up with a remake that starts reorganizing things at a deeper level than just the look and sound. Those things are precious too, though. Trying to remake that first glimpse of the Kingdom of Zeal would be like going in decades later and trying to monkey around with <em>Laurence of Arabia</em>. Good luck! But also I would 100 percent use it as an excuse to go back and replay<em> Chrono Trigger</em> either way. Some games are too good to be remade. Others are so good that no remake could ever take anything away from them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[To The Moon Founder Promises To ‘Make It Better’ For 2026 Following Disastrous Expo]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-founder-make-it-better-for-2026/</link>
            <guid>1371541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>To The Moon’s inaugural event took place last month in the United Kingdom, and it was, by all accounts, a complete shambles. The images and clips shared on social media painted a picture of a sorry affair in every respect, and many creators made videos exposing the event as an utter failure.</p>



<p>Weeks after the event, To The Moon’s founder, Monty Stewart, has surfaced on LinkedIn with a lengthy statement about what comes next for the expo. He stressed that <strong>it will </strong>be back, and suggested that this year’s expo wasn’t all that bad.</p>







<h2 id="h-to-the-moon-will-return-in-2026">To The Moon Will Return in 2026</h2>



<p>Early in November, To The Moon was on a little marketing kick, and the materials provided suggested that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-expo-recover-uk-games-expo/">planned to revive</a> the UK’s failing gaming expo scene. Fast forward to a weekday in the middle of November, and To The Moon had arrived, halted temporarily by bad weather, poor planning, and an almost empty conference hall in Birmingham, England.</p>



<p>On social media, creators wasted no time sharing images of the event, with some claiming they’d spent hundreds to reach the venue and were left feeling extremely sour and disappointed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Alright last little photo dump of To the Moon Expo. These feature the VR Arena, B2B Trade stage, the Indie ‘City’ and the LAN Zone</p><p>Honestly my favourite part is flat hall lighting considering we were meant to be in a (checks notes) Spaceship… <a href="https://t.co/yINWrmiGpW">pic.twitter.com/yINWrmiGpW</a></p></div>— 💽 CaptainAshtro🔜DreamHack (@CaptainAshtro) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainAshtro/status/1989293562169843739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>There was almost nothing good to take away from To The Moon, but that’s not how the expo’s founder, Monty Stewart, put it on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7401872276251631616/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>On a personal level I wanted to say thank you to every single person that has supported and continues to support the vision of To The Moon Expo and attended. Every speaker, exhibitor, attendee and the like.</p><p>Seeing the vast majority of posts on LinkedIn being positive, hearing that some of our indies acquired investment meetings and received invaluable feedback on their games is a check box for me; alongside gamers being able to interact with actual games and their favourite IP’s, not just merch stalls. And let us not forget, we were the largest gathering of unique studios and games under one roof nationally within the UK for 2025.</p><p>If we can help people realise their dreams, acquire the funding they need to shoot for the stars and follow their creative passion; that is a win.</p><p>Were there some learning curves? For sure. Definitely some curveballs with the weather and a couple other aspects, but we continued onwards and adapted with the hand we were dealt.</p><p>Can we make it better? Damn right. How are we going to do that? We are looking to 2026 and moving forward with experience that only progress can teach!</p><p>I cannot wait to share with you what is coming for next year. I am also incredibly grateful to not have to handle the mantle by myself moving forward into 2026.</p><p>Innovation has always belonged those willing to challenge the status quo, not those who cling to it. So to the certain few people who have spent more energy on blocking new ideas than building their own; don’t worry, we aren’t here to replace you. Time will handle that for us.</p><p>We will continue to stand at the Vanguard for our creative industry and our movement to ensure that exhibiting at events is not fiscally gatekept and that creative passion within the UK and the globe can thrive.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Not only does Stewart think the event wasn’t all that bad, but he also intends to come back in 2026 with a new expo, seemingly expecting it to be better received just because he promises it will be.</p>



<p>Some reports came in ahead of the event that revealed how ill-planned it was, even before it landed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I will not be speaking at To The Moon Expo next week</p><p>I was asked to be part of an Esports advisory group for the event some months ago; however, after the announcement, we were never consulted</p><p>The panel that I was put on last minute, had little to no structure &amp; a loose topic</p></div>— Jeff Simpkins (@HereLiesJeff) <a href="https://twitter.com/HereLiesJeff/status/1986463348821467570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Everyday gamers went to the expo at the NEC in Birmingham expecting a spectacle of an event because of bold marketing claims, but were met with almost nothing to do. One user wrote on X (formerly Twitter), <em>‘Went to see the To the Moon expo today as it was my first ever time heading to see one, it’s just disappointing how little there was to do there, legitimately one area just has consoles connected to monitors with Minecraft installed.’</em></p>



<p>This is a little first-person perspective, but I was invited to attend To The Moon and got cold feet in the morning before making the 2.5-hour drive to Birmingham, instructing my colleague to ‘stay in bed’ because I had some ill juju about the expo. Was that a lucky escape?</p>



<p>Sadly, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/">EGX has died a death</a>, Insomnia appears to be coming back under some distrustful banner, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-london-wasd/">WASD has also faded</a> into an abyss; there’s effectively nothing left in the United Kingdom for gamers.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord if you attended To The Moon</a> and what you thought about the event.</p>
