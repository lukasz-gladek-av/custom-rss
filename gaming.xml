<p>2026 with the genre mix</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Silver Lining Interactive has just announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/death_howl">Death Howl</a> — which is currently sat on a rather healthy <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/death-howl/">Metascore of 84</a> — will release for Switch on <strong>20th February 2026</strong> (it's out today on Xbox and PC). Oh, and there's a physical version and everything. Hooray!</p>
<p>The game itself has a very intriguing art style and set-up, which you can check out for yourself in the trailer up top, and gameplay is described as melding Soulslike combat with your usual deckbuilding strategy aspects. It's a lot of stuff we really like, in other words, all mixed together.</p>
<p>In Death Howl, you assume the role of Ro, a grieving mother who seeks to resurrect her dead son. So, keeping it all nice and light on the narrative front.</p>
<p>In order to do said resurrecting, Ro needs to "craft cards, harness shamanic totems, and face tormented spirits across mystical realms, blending tactical deck-building with intense grid-based combat."</p>
<p>Here's some further details from ye olde press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A journey to the spirit realm</strong><br>
In forgotten lands cloaked in myth, Ro, a hunter from a humble tribe, descends into the spirit world guided only by grief and distant whispers. Her path uncovers love, loss, and resilience as every step reveals hidden memories and long-buried truths.</p>
<p><strong>Master your deck-building skills</strong></p>
<p>Explore eerie regions, gather ingredients, and craft cards to expand your tactical options. Shamanic totems unlock powerful abilities, while melee and ranged spells allow you to balance offence and defence. Every card shapes your survival strategy against relentless enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Engage in grid-based combat</strong></p>
<p>Test your wits against unique enemy types and towering bosses in tense, grid-based encounters. Adapt your deck to carve a path through haunted lands like the <strong>Forest of Howling Shadows</strong> and the <strong>Meadows of Delusion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A mother’s grief, a spirit’s journey</strong></p>
<p>Beyond combat, <em>Death Howl</em> is a moving tale of grief, healing, and acceptance. Ro’s journey into the unknown is both harrowing and hopeful, weaving an atmospheric story where every victory carries the weight of love and loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the physical edition, pre-orders are now open over at <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/products/absolum-standard-edition-nintendo-switch-copy?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4c4b6d51e&amp;_ss=r">Silver Lining's official website</a> and priced at £29.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are). Given that the game has garnered so much positive feedback thus far, we'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it as that Switch release date draws near.</p>

            <guid>1377100</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been able to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deadpool-vr-review-merc-with-headset" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="12ddfe5a-7798-4d72-9058-9b474607a06e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool</em> </a>and<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/men-in-black-most-wanted-review-once-you-go-worm" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8f5e286b-3833-487f-a7f5-e19a75067d5e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em> Men In Black</em></a> recently, so I was more than excited when the opportunity was presented to me to slip into a turtle shell and get hands-on with the opening sequence of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> for Quest 3.</p><p>Developed by Cortopia Studios, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> is a co-op action adventure game where you can swap between each of the different turtles to protect the city streets (and roofs, and sewers, etc) from the Foot Clan.</p><p>The gameplay demo began immediately as I was able to look down and see my three-fingered green hand and a blue wristband. The games opening immediately introduces you to a number of the core features of the game; movement, stealth, and how to draw your weapon.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-sneak-attack.jpg?itok=_9w3NURn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1072" height="1079">

  </picture><h2>Heroes In A Half Shell</h2><p>A brief amount of story was set up in this opening. With a call from April O'Neil, which was frequently interrupted by Master Splinter and Casey, it is established that the Turtles have been gone from New York City, exploring the world for some time.</p><p>In their absence, the Foot Clan has started to make moves, raising the crime rate in the city. An off comment about having to defeat Shredder all over again tells us that this isn't the first time that the turtles have had to kick Shredder from power.</p><p>Later in the gameplay demo, when I had some time to explore the Turtles' Lair, I was presented with a number of screens showing 10-12 different regions with a high crime rate. I'm sure that will evolve into the level system of the full game when it releases in 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>There was no immediate sign or any of the other larger than life characters from TMNT, like Bebop, Rocksteady, or Krang… but I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't far away from the rest of the criminals.</p><h2>Run, Jump, And Attack Like A Ninja Turtle</h2><p>There's a lot here that you'd expect, moving with the left stick, a UI system built into your wristwatch, and drawing your weapons over your shoulder.</p><p>For the most part, the melee combat was as you'd expect for a VR game, while you can come into an encounter with precision, it's not too long before you learn the most efficient way to attack is just by flailing your arms. The most fun weapons to handle were Mikey's nunchucks and Donatello's bo-staff.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-nunchuk.jpg?itok=PWpc8Ffh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-nunchuk.jpg?itok=xs4UvHKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p>The physics of the nunchucks were a lot of fun to flail around with, and even better, the faster you spun them, the more powerful they'd become. The bo-staff is unique in that you cain wield it with one hand as a long pole to hit with, or with both hands to move it quickly around. The nunchucks let you go crazier, while the bo-staff makes you feel like you need to be a bit more deliberate with your actions.</p><p>Outside the turtle's standard weapons, there are a few smoke and electricity grenades that you come across, but those seem pretty situational. There are teases of additional weapons, but I'll have to see how they play out in the full game.</p><p>An interesting change to exploring the world is having looking left and right mapped to the right stick, but that up is jump and down is to crouch.</p><p>It took a bit to initially get into, at that point I'd been pressing buttons and just rationalized that there was no jump, but after spending some time practising moving and jumping in quick succession, it did feel easy to have it all in one place, as opposed to having to quickly swap between looking and jumping with a button.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Throw Yourself Into The Air</h2><p>The freeform movement is enhanced further by the ability to propel yourself off different fixtures like window frames, lightpoles, and ledges. Holding onto one of these with a hand you can throw yourself, propelling yourself through the air.</p><p>Leaping from rooftop to rooftop was immediately a fun experience, running and jumping, and even if you missed, you could quickly throw yourself back up onto the rooftop using the environment.</p><p>One accidental downside of this freedom of movement that I did experience was that I missed a trigger in the game that meant enemies didn't spawn correctly, and I got stuck in an alleyway with nowhere to go. It took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong… I just needed to retrace my footsteps and take the 'correct' path through the city.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Hints Of The Full Edition</h2><p>After completing the brief tutorial, I got to return to The Lair, the Turtle's sewer hideout. Complete with a common space, a dojo, and personalized rooms for each of the Turtles. There were a number of good hints about just how much there will be to do in the full game.</p><p>A few collectibles leaned into skill points that will be able to be used to upgrade the turtles, an old-school TMNT Arcade Cabinet was the mechanism to change between the four Turtles, and a vending machine showed a variety of sillouetted items.</p><p>It's clear the team at Cortopia studios is going for a lot of replayability, reasons to swap between the turtles, and reasons to replay levels hunting down goodies.</p><p>While I didn't get to get too far in my <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> preview, what was there I did like. The use of the control stick to handle turning, crouching, and jumping at the same time did a good job to free up other buttons, and I look forward to seeing how your options expand.</p><p>I do feel like this will suffer from the 'VR Melee' combat issue with no weight behind the objects and no collision, but if you're fine to flail in VR for a TMNT power fantasy, then you'll be just fine.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Most Wanted </strong>was previewed on Meta Quest 3 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 30 minutes of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Kirby Air Riders: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657</link>
            <guid>1377094</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Shake </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> up in a two-liter bottle and crack it open over my face. A blast of color, speed, and delightful nonsense confront my senses at 200 miles per hour. This is a game in such a rush it will have you craving a dedicated acceleration button—like every other racing game—just so you can choose not to press it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And under its sugary waterfall of selectable characters, meaningfully different vehicles, distinct game modes, and endless permutations of stat-boosting power-ups, the game tries to seduce you into believing it must be substantial. How could something with this many moving parts not be?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s the same confidence you get from a Snickers commercial: all those layers, the caramel stretch, the peanuts tumbling in slow motion, the cross-section of nougat and chocolate shown off like a slice of Earth itself. “Snickers really satisfies,” they say, and for a moment you might believe it can take the place of a meal.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it can’t. And we shouldn’t pretend it can. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> is not deep; it’s candy. Good thing I like candy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whether you’re playing the standard race mode, Air Ride, or pinballing through the labyrinthian city of City Trial, the same thing becomes clear almost immediately: this game is an absolute delight in the moment. Rick the Hamster zooms past me like he’s running the most important errands of his life. King Dedede launches himself at enemies like they owe him rent.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Vehicles vary wildly. Some soar through the sky with an ease that feels like cheating. Some never leave the ground and exist solely to plow through anything unlucky enough to be in the way. One machine refuses to turn unless you come to a complete stop and pivot it like a couch wedged in a stairwell with rockets glued to its cushions. You pick a ride, angle your landings, follow another racer’s star trail for a boost. You are making decisions—just not always at the pace the game makes them for you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Air Ride</span></i><span>’s endless forward propulsion means half the race is happening before you can even consciously participate in it. You slam into enemies you didn’t intend to hit, scoop up items you didn’t know existed, and cross the finish line because your momentum got you there five seconds before your intentions did. The tracks don’t present information so much as hurl it at you like a piñata detonating point-blank. Walls, enemies, items, other racers all fizz past faster than your brain can sort them. At times, I have no sense that I’m competing with other racers at all—just running my own little Kirby marathon and hoping the game taps me on the shoulder afterward and says, “Yeah, sure, you did it!”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651659">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>City Trial should be the moment all this chaos finally gels into structure. Five minutes in a sprawling city full of crates, pickups, random events, and machines parked like abandoned shopping carts: it sounds like the place where all your choices might finally matter. The mode where the candy bar reveals its hidden protein. In practice, however, I’m mostly just sprinting toward whatever glowing object catches my eye like a foaming-mouthed raccoon loose in an arcade.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every run starts the same way: I spawn, immediately spot some sweet nectar in the form of a giant stat icon, and chase it without a second thought. I crack open crates for upgrades I may or may not need the way I once tore open packs of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> cards. I swap vehicles entirely on impulse: Do I want to bulldoze players with a bruiser or sprint around scooping up gold? Some of the best moments happen when I accidentally fly into an item that arms my ride with a bazooka while another player is in view. It all feels impulsive and reactive—less like strategy and more like a string of magnificently sweet accidents.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Then the timer expires, and City Trial’s other half reveals itself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No matter what I’ve built—speed freak, flight savant, combat gremlin—the final Stadium event always comes down to choosing the challenge that flatters whatever numbers I’ve stumbled into. End up with a flying machine? Pick “soar as far as possible.” Stuck with the brick with a steering wheel? Smash into things. It’s not strategy; it’s choosing the activity that best matches the outfit you accidentally showed up in.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What makes it stranger is that everyone is making this same calculation at the same time. We all wander off into finales tailored to our own careless smoothies of a build. My friend and I can spend five minutes in the same City Trial, diverge into completely different Stadium events, and both walk away clutching first-place trophies like we attended different sporting events at the same festival. The victory is immediately fleeting for any player who forgets to tap the screenshot button.</span></p>

 <p><span>I say fleeting because the game barely acknowledges any of it. Your character enthusiastically devours the center of the frame while a tiny scoreboard off to the side reveals the truth—another moment swallowed up without a thought, just one more sugar-coated delight Kirby inhales before moving on to the next.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>His appetite is insatiable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Mine is not.</span></p> <p><span>Kirby can swallow moments whole without worrying about what comes after; I start noticing the repetition long before he would. And City Trial, for all its clippable glory, reveals its limits fast. The same sprint toward giant icons, the same bullying of whoever pinballed into my crosshairs. Matches blend together like different colors of M&amp;Ms. If I experience “chaos” the exact same way every run, is it even chaos anymore? No. It’s just candy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After hours of trying to taste a fire hose of content sprayed into my face, Top Ride is the first mode that politely hands me a plate and asks if I’d like to really appreciate what’s happening. Top Ride looks, at first glance, like the kind of small bonus mode many players might never click on. But in practice, it’s a compelling part of </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It reveals that the chaos in the other modes was never incomprehensible. It was just loud. </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> throws so much flashy information at you that it tricks you into feeling overwhelmed, even though most of that information is negligible. Top Ride simply pulls the camera back and proves it. With a little distance, everything becomes legible.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651662">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Unlike other modes, in Top Ride you see every racer at once. Cause and effect—usually buried under spectacle—becomes clear. Misjudge a drift and you feel the punishment instantly. Take a cleaner line and you watch yourself gain ground in real time. It still uses the same propulsion-based movement as the rest of </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, but now the information arrives at a pace a human being can actually process. And with that clarity comes something the rest of the game rarely offers: the feeling that I can learn, improve, and shape the next round through actual decision-making rather than chaos washing over me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Road Trip attempts to congeal a sampler platter of the same short Stadium games from the other modes into a single-player roguelike. Every mini-game leads to a stat boost, but in all my runs, the boosts ramped up so evenly that the joy of creating a specific build surrendered to an experience where every number simply climbed at once. The choices don’t give way to branching paths so much as gently funnel toward an eventual victory over CPU opponents that never stood a chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Every so often Road Trip rewards players with a treat: a cinematic cutscene featuring production values that far exceed what the mode prepares you for. The sheer melodrama might seduce you into believing the story here is mysterious and chaotic, but it’s really just a simple storybook tale of good versus evil. Charming, fun, and no more than a little treat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> also comes bundled with a customization suite that lets players decorate their own machines with decals and silly hats. The most-downloaded creation online briefly included a Warp Star made to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-custom-vehicle-designs-market-best-2000645836"><span>look like Chef Kawasaki in a bikini</span></a><span>.

<p>A new report by Capcom reveals that they will bring new releases and remakes of Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and Ace Attorney to new hardware. </p>



<p>Capcom has some massive franchises under its belt, which include Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter. However, they also have smaller franchises, which have a considerable user base. Capcom has stated that it will work to bring more projects for these franchises as well. </p>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom has released its <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 integrated report</a>, in which COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto has spoken about developing new projects, remakes, and ports for its other IPs. The statement first talks about Capcom aiming to sustain their “KPI of 10% or better annual operating profit growth along with our long-term goal of annual software sales of 100 million units.” Their efforts are “focused on core IP such as the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter franchises, and mapping out mainline series entries and sequels, remakes, new IP, and ports of content to the latest hardware.” </p>



<p>The statement adds that the developers release “two or three major new titles each year,” but have recognised they need to grow their pipeline. Capcom owns popular IPs such as Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Mega Man, and their goal is to expand the user base and improve performance “through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware.” They will grow these franchises into core IPs “by enhancing the brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan wants to play Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption adaptation.</p>



<p>During a recent appearance at a convention, the The Walking Dead star took part in a fan Q&amp;A session. As part of that session, one fan as him if he’d be at all interested in playing the main protagonist from Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>







<p><strong>“That’s the one that I want to do,” </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/__GLLVjR2O0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he&nbsp;told the fan</a>. <strong>“It’s not even a question. One, the only genre… My favorite genre is western and there’s not even a close second. And my son plays that game and it’s freaking awesome. In a heartbeat, I would do it for free.”</strong></p>



<p>Though he’s mainly known for film and television roles, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is no stranger to lending his voice to video games. Back in 2019, he voiced a virtual version of his The Walking Dead character Negan for Tekken 7 DLC. </p>



<p>Do you think Jeffrey Dean Morgan would make for a good Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption show or movie?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of insane that I never realized how perfectly Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would work as a VR game. VR action games famously feature loads of jumping and climbing, which our turt bros do a whole bunch of on Manhattan rooftops. Sneaking around to do melee combat, and having to learn how to parry and dodge incoming attacks is also something the reptilian heroes are known for that has been done well in many VR games. And because these heroes in a half-shell appear most commonly as cartoons, you don’t have to worry about shooting for photorealistic graphics and the technical VR bottlenecks that sometimes come with it. In other words, why in the heck did it take us so long to get this pizza-powered quartet into a VR game? No matter the reason, I’m glad it’s finally happening with TMNT: Empire City, and the 15-minute demo I played was enough to sell me on this tubular action-adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City is exactly the kind of action game you’d expect from the titular masked heroes. I spent my time fighting members of the Foot Clan as each member of the TMNT crew (including their iconic weapons of choice, like Leonardo’s katanas and Donatello’s bo staff), running and jumping across city skylines in pursuit of justice, and hanging out back in my sewer base and eating pizza. Doing all of that in VR is exactly as fun as it sounds (meaning, it’s super fun!), and it’s especially amusing to look down at your turtle body and remember, “Oh, yeah. I’m an anthropomorphic mutated reptile.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">TMNT: Empire City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the section I played was limited entirely to the tutorial, so I was mostly just learning the ropes, like how to hack into electronic devices as Donatello (since he does machines) or how to perform parries on those pesky Shredder-following Foot Clan. The fundamentals were definitely strong, as I was grinning ear-to-ear pretty much the whole time, but I’ll be curious to see if Empire City can build on that to keep it interesting across an entire campaign. For example, I only got to fight one boss at the very end of this introductory mission, and it lasted all of – I kid you not – five seconds as I dodged her opening attack and then whaled on her until she tapped out. Obviously this fight was also a part of the tutorial, so it’s hard to tell if things will get more challenging, but here’s hoping.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Building a Better Turtle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Something that would seem to indicate a deeper level of challenge is the fact that back at the base there’s a whole menu of upgrades to deal with. None of these were unlockable in the build I played from what I could tell, but it reminded me a bit of the upgrade system in Half-Life: Alyx, where you’re collecting parts throughout levels, then funnel it all into a machine to craft certain upgrades for your character. It’s also just great to see them using Donatello’s propensity for crafting gadgets brought to life via all the junk he stuffs in his pocket along the way, which his brothers made fun of him for doing, of course.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I never forgot which of the brothers I was because Empire City did such a good job or reminding me with its banter that was completely on point with the surprisingly good writing for which the series is known.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me to one of my favorite parts of the demo: how perfectly Ninja Turtles it was! The banter between the brothers and their recognizable idiosyncrasies left me smiling, whether it was Leonardo’s tendency to be way too serious all the time, Michelangelo’s wise cracks, or Raphael’s intensity and impatience. The unique weapon aside, I never forgot which of the brothers I was because Empire City did such a good job or reminding me with its banter that was completely on point with the surprisingly good writing for which the series is known. I could easily imagine a world where this thing felt like a reskinned ninja game that felt completely generic, but that doesn’t seem to be the case here. Huge relief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They also do a really good job capturing the comic book/Saturday morning cartoon art style, with environments that look cel-shaded and goofy voice performances that are over-the-top and amusing. Sure, lots of the textures are fairly undetailed, but that works pretty perfectly with the straight-from-a-comicbook vibe that this game is clearly shooting for. I could easily see myself spending a lot of time just hanging out in this world, exploring and fighting alongside friends. Which reminds me: will there be skateboarding in this? Why haven’t they let me skateboard yet?!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">(Multi-)Turtle Power?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One pretty huge thing I didn’t get to see in action is how this will all work in four-player co-op. I can only imagine how much of a blast it’s going to be to roll through with the full shell squad smacking enemies around, but the section of the demo I played felt pretty designed for a single player and it’s a bit difficult to imagine how this kind of gameplay might scale up for four-player bouts. Presumably there’d need to be many more enemies and fewer linear paths than the ones I crept through to make it work. Also, I can only imagine how silly it’ll look to have teammates running around as big ol’ green cartoon characters while swinging around nunchucks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll still need to see a fair bit more of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Empire City before I can speak definitively on it, but so far I’m pretty stoked by the potential here and am absolutely flabbergasted that it took us this long to get a first-person TMNT game.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tmnt-empire-city-hands-on-preview-why-the-ninja-turtles-might-be-perfect-for-vr]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, December 9, 2025. Below, we examine how it carried the torch of the classic films to create the best new piece of Indy fiction in decades.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones is one of the most revered blockbuster stories of the 1980s. Spielberg and Lucas' work on the original trilogy stands alongside Jaws and Star Wars as timeless classics that are worth revisiting regularly. The more recent entries--the Crystal Skull and the Dial of Destiny--do little to live up to the standard that the first three set. But the game Indiana Jones and The Great Circle brings everything about that original trilogy back, like a careful archaeological dig. It's the true successor to one of the original blockbuster trilogies.</p><p dir="ltr">As we hit The Great Circle's first anniversary, it is clearer than ever that MachineGames accomplished something the film series has struggled to for the last 20 years. The Great Circle feels like the real successor to The Last Crusade, not because it imitates it beat for beat, but because it understands the core ingredients that make an Indiana Jones story timeless. It is a globe-spanning mystery built on discovery and the thrill of pushing deeper into the unknown. It captures the charm of a character who is smart, stubborn, curious, and always one quip away from a bruised rib.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1781615812" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

There is an artifact, a lead, and a hint that the past is far more complicated than any textbook suggests. But what stands out is the tone. MachineGames focuses less on spectacle and more on the physicality of exploring dusty ruins, studying clues, and approaching history. Rather than overwhelming the player with nonstop action, the game treats archaeology as an adventure in itself. Every carved mural and hidden chamber carries a sense of meaning. Every step feels like it matters as you explore beautiful sandboxes within places like Italy and Egypt.</p><p dir="ltr">That approach immediately recalls The Last Crusade. One of the reasons that film resonated so strongly was its belief that the past could speak to the present. The Holy Grail was not just a treasure, but also a test of humility and understanding. The Great Circle taps into that same idea. Its central mystery is intertwined with ancient belief systems, cultural legacies, and the gaps between historical interpretation and the supernatural.</p><p dir="ltr">MachineGames leans into that tension. Indy knows his history, but realizes there is far more he doesn't know--especially when giants show up out of nowhere and knock him around. The game lets him be wrong and momentarily outmatched by the worlds he explores. That humility makes the discoveries feel more genuine. Instead of watching a larger-than-life hero breeze through challenges, the player sees a man carefully piecing together clues and reevaluating his assumptions as the mystery grows stranger. It brings back the sense that the world still has secrets worth chasing.</p><p dir="ltr">The game’s puzzles reinforce this theme. Turning ancient mechanisms, studying inscriptions, and matching clues across continents creates a slow, satisfying rhythm. The Great Circle understands that idea and expands it across the entire journey. Solving puzzles becomes a way of understanding the cultures and beliefs that shaped the mystery, not just a way of unlocking the next hallway.</p><p dir="ltr">Character work is another place where The Great Circle succeeds. Indiana Jones stories thrive on personal stakes and complicated relationships. MachineGames builds a cast that challenges Indy in ways both emotional and intellectual. Allies are not always reliable. Enemies are not always predictable. The game gives space for Indy to react, worry, and rethink his choices. The tension is not purely about the treasure but about what chasing that treasure means for the world around him.</p><p dir="ltr">This is one of the areas where later films sometimes drifted. They often leaned toward larger spectacle, broader stakes, or downright silly moments. An image of Shia LaBeouf swinging with monkeys is not the image you want moviegoers remembering after leaving the theater. The Great Circle brings those intimate pressures back. Indy’s journey is tied to his belief that history can still reveal truths worth risking everything for. The mystery challenges him not just physically, but morally.</p><p dir="ltr">Action scenes in The Great Circle also feel more connected to the old films. Combat is scrappy and improvisational. Indy does not move like a superhero, but like a tired professor who has learned to survive through grit, instinct, and whatever object is within reach. The whip feels like a tool rather than a gimmick. Fights are messy, loud, and shaped by the environment. Even in the biggest moments, the action feels rooted in physical spaces instead of glossy abstraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618383-4410081-whip-cracking-action.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618383" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618383-4410081-whip-cracking-action.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618383"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618383-4410081-whip-cracking-action.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Most importantly, the game revives the sense of adventure that comes from simply not knowing what lies ahead. Later films sometimes struggled with pacing or leaned heavily on modern blockbuster formulas. The Great Circle trusts silence, mystery, and slow discovery. It makes ruins feel ancient and dangerous. It lets riddles feel like riddles. It lets Indy pause, think, and listen. Those quiet moments make the dramatic, loud ones matter more.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is a story that feels in conversation with The Last Crusade rather than competing with it. It respects the character and the mythology without slipping into imitation. It treats faith, history, and myth as forces that shape people, not props. It gives Indy room to be fallible. It understands that the thrill of Indiana Jones is not just the treasure he seeks, but the journey he takes to understand why that treasure mattered to the people who created it.</p><p dir="ltr">As the game's first anniversary hits today, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stands as one of the most confident and authentic takes on the character in decades. MachineGames did not reinvent him--the studio simply remembered who he was and what made his world so exciting. It remembered that the best Indy stories are about stepping into the shadows of the past and finding something worth believing in.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0871e01975892"><a title="Resident Evil 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0871e01975892/resident-evil-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hideki Kamiya, the famed game creator who made his directorial debut with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/resident_evil_2">Resident Evil 2</a>, has been talking a lot about the survival horror series in recent days.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1998, Resident Evil 2 was a significant step up from the first game, though its production was troubled, to say the least. After completing around 60-80% of the initial build, development was restarted when script writer Noburu Sugimura was added to the team. Prior to this, in what is now known as Biohazard (Resident Evil) 1.5, the game had almost no connection to the original, and certainly no returning characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="53peCvnRDq8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt53peCvnRDq8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53peCvnRDq8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938a0lvgpmu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>In responding to a fan's comment speculating on the inclusion of Rebecca Chambers in Resident Evil 2, Kamiya explained the reasoning behind the decision to go with completely new protagonists. He states that he "didn't consider the feelings of the users" at the time and wanted to provide his own vision for the sequel. When Sugimura joined, however, Kamiya was convinced to create Claire Redfield, whose brother, Chris, was one of the primary protagonists of the original.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At the time, I was a selfish idiot who didn't consider the feelings of the users, so when I was making Biohazard 2, I decided to remove all the characters from the previous game and start a new one.</p>
<p>"In the end, this was buried in the dark as Biohazard 1.5, and when Sugimura-sensei joined the team later, he got mad at me, saying, "Why aren't you including the characters from the previous game?", so I added Chris's sister, Claire..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Biohazard 1.5 is not available in any official capacity, fans have been diligently working on creating a playable version, with various builds available since around 2013. Capcom itself officially recognised 1.5 in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a> remake, adding in a special costume for Claire based on concept art for the scrapped protagonist Elza Walker.</p>
<p>Fans of the series on Switch 2 can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, all of which will release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Ride 6 has been developed using Unreal Engine 5 which has allowed Milestone to add in a new dual physics system. This is split between Pro for players who want to get right into the simulation side of Ride 6, and Arcade for players who just want to ride around without having to fiddle too much with different bike parts. The Riding School will allow players to learn different parts of the game and complete challenges, and Ride 6 will also support cross platform play multiplayer. Split screen multiplayer and a race creator are not going to be available at launch for Ride 6, but will come later down the line. The game will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios' Head and game director for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series (as well as Starfield), Todd Howard, recently chimed in on the hottest topic across most industries: the usage of AI.</p>



<p><span>Eurogamer<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games" target="_blank"> interviewed Howard</a></span> during a preview event for the second season of Fallout's Amazon Prime Video show, which starts airing on Wednesday, December 17. On that occasion, the veteran developer mused that AI is effectively a tool that can make development go faster, but it won't replace the human intention, which is what really makes Bethesda's games (and great games in general) special. </p>



<p><em>I view it as a tool. Creative intention comes from human artists, number one. But, I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things.</em></p>



<p><em>I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop. That's our view on it. But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special.</em></p>



<p>It's a similar view to that of fellow games industry legend Hideo Kojima, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> to consider AI as a 'friend' that could perform tedious tasks, thereby boosting efficiency, while he and the rest of his team at Kojima Productions focus on creative tasks.</p>



<p>Efficiency is definitely among the top priorities of large, triple-A game developers and publishers nowadays. With the continuous rise of budgets, AI is seen as an essential tool to reduce costs. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that efficiency, expansion, and transformation are the three key areas of innovation that AI amplifies. However, as noted by Todd Howard, its application cannot come at the expense of human creativity. </p>



<p>As a side note, Eurogamer also asked Howard about his game of the year, and the Elder Scrolls and Fallout director joined the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-goty-votes-phil-spencer-naoki-hamaguchi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chorus of creatives and executives who voted for Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-ryzen-9-gets-another-price-drop-after-black-friday-as-amazon-clears-out-best-selling-cpu-stock-2000651635</link>
            <guid>1377040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your regular days involve running demanding creative software or playing high-end gaming titles, an average laptop isn’t going to cut it. You need a high-performing processor that’s specifically built keeping these use cases in mind, and today is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/">The ultra-powerful, 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 9950X desktop processor, which usually goes for $649, is available for $530, after a nice 18% discount.</a> It’s a straightforward $119 drop, meaning there are no long coupon codes to remember or complicated checkout steps to follow. This is the lowest it’s dropped to in the last 30 days, and we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. Place your orders before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smooth Performance for Demanding Tasks</h2>
<p>This processor is made keeping creatives and gamers in mind. The 16 Cores and 32 processing threads are based on AMD’s Zen 5 architecture that evolves with your needs, letting you push all creative and entertainment limits without holding back. It’s packed with the power you need to level up with its 5.7 GHz Max Boost clock speed during demanding tasks, plus offers features like AMD Expo tech, one-touch memory overclocking for instant lift when it’s showtime. In simple words, the processor is more than capable of handling tasks like heavier video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming. Need even more power for a larger project? It offers that too, helping you stay on top of your game, regardless of what the day requires.</p>



<p>DDR5-5600 support lets you multitask faster, which can especially come in handy when you’re trying to manage a bunch of things at the same time. There’s PCIe 5.0 support on select motherboards just as well. This makes your system future-proof, plus lets you enjoy quicker transfer and boot times. Even better, AMD Ryzen 5 offers built-in AI acceleration and enhanced AI capabilities for unmatched productivity. For an even smoother experience, it’s best to pair the processor with the Radeon RX 7000 Series graphics card for a complete, ultra-fast setup.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to perform heavy-duty creative tasks like video editing and modeling more efficiently, or game like a pro, having the right processor in your setup can make all the difference. This one, in particular, offers incredible performance for all your tasks, no matter how demanding they get. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/">On a regular day, it would run you around $649, but this deal lets you grab it for $530.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, sure, but one that’s going to be worth it. The offer is selling out fast, though. At this rate, the stock could run dry sooner than you anticipate, which is why we highly recommend grabbing yours without wasting time. Ordering now will also help you get it before Christmas; great if you’re planning to surprise a loved one with it this holiday season.</p>

<p>The 'Dig to the Beat' event gets underway on <strong>16th December</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>23rd December</strong>, so you have plenty of time to rack up an Emerald Rush high score and pick up the reward statues.</p>
<p>And what rewards they are! Hot off the back of Lanky and Chunky Kong's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/donkey-kong-bananzas-next-dlc-in-game-event-swings-into-action-next-week">statue appearances last month</a>, the upcoming event features Jungle Beat's Ghastly and Ninja Kong, immortalised as unlockable island accessories.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ogstuh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>For reference, here is the exact time that the 'Dig to the Beat' event will kick off in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As was the case with the two debut events, this one will challenge you to complete Emerald Rush runs with a limited, pre-determined set of perks available, so prepare to switch up your gem-collecting tactics on the fly.</p>
<p>This will likely be the final in-game event of the year, but we expect to see more swing over to the DLC package in 2026.</p>

              <p>Looking to game better this holiday season? The right controller can make playtime a lot more fun. If your current controller no longer feels comfortable to hold, and you’re dealing with stick drift or weak triggers, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">We just spotted the PlayStation DualSense wireless controller in Chroma Teal going for just $60 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 25% off its $80 price tag. Is Green not your vibe? There are several other color options going for less, too. The stunning black version, for instance, is sitting at $54 after a 28% drop, while the bold Volcanic Red color can be yours for $59, at a sweet 26% discount. There’s quite a lot to choose from, but there’s a catch. These deals are selling out fast, and the stock is likely to run out soon. If you’ve been looking to enjoy your favorite titles to the fullest during the holidays, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>It’s made to feel comfortable in the hands with an evolved design, featuring responsive sticks and a familiar layout. The integrated touch pad, accelerometer, and gyroscope come together to provide motion controls for tracking movement and rotation. In-game actions will be felt physically with dual actuators, and in select titles, these vibrations can simulate even the feeling of the digital environment for a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>There’s a built-in microphone to chat with friends during the games, record your own voice to save your reaction, plus use voice search for apps or the console’s menu. The 3.5mm jack lets you connect a headset to the console for a private listening experience, meaning you won’t have to rely on your TV speakers or face audio delays. The dedicated mute button makes it easy to switch voice capture on or off with a single push without having to go through a complicated settings menu.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, it works primarily with the PS5, but you can also connect it via Bluetooth or USB to other devices like Windows, PCs, Macs, iOS, Android, select tablets, and Apple TV. That means you don’t limit yourself to a single device. Maybe use it with the console during a solo session, and switch to a bigger screen when playing with friends!</p>
<p>All things considered, if you have been looking to play your favorite titles in a more immersive way and need a new controller without stretching your budget, now is the time to act. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">This deal takes 25% off this responsive controller that typically goes for $80.</a> There are multiple colors available, so there are quite a lot of options to pick from. This also makes it a good time to pick a couple of options, if you’re also looking to gift one to a loved one, or just want to have a spare one lying around for when friends come over. That said, there are plenty of other tech gadgets going for less, too, so now is a great time to stock up on other essentials like laptops, chargers, and consoles if you missed grabbing something during Black Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has revealed an odd but intriguing crossover for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, as the popular flight-sim game is bringing Netflix’s Stranger Things to the game, and in this day and age, stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>Stranger Things Season 5 is all the rage right now. Netflix’s hit show is into its fifth and final season, bringing down the curtain on one of the most-watched TV shows ever. In the gaming world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has launched on PlayStation 5, marking the first appearance for the franchise on a Sony console.</p>



<p>Someone behind the scenes was clearly interested to see what would happen if you joined these opposing forces together, and now there’s an answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-visit-iconic-stranger-things-location-in-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">You Can Visit Iconic Stranger Things Location In Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stranger crossovers have happened. Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll be able to explore Hawkins like never before. See and visit real locations from the show in the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: Stranger Things expansion, available December 9.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-introduces-netflixs-stranger-things-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a> Blog said: “You will be able to explore a highly detailed map and recreation of the town with more than 40 iconic locations made famous by the show.”</p>



<p>Some of the locations include Starcourt Mall, Hawkins Middle School, and Hawkins Junkyard.</p>



<p>The expansion includes five new missions taking you around the town in a Bell UH-1H Huey helicopter, and you need to rescue residents in danger. It makes sense for any game right now to cash in on the Stranger Things final season hype, but a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 wouldn’t have been near the top of your lists!</p>

You don't have to worry about dragons, wizards, or orcs killing you in this game, but you still have to survive in some harsh conditions. Now, a free update for Medieval Dynasty is adding some new touches for the game that go beyond mere survival.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzajklWJTDI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dzajklWJTDI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There were pregnancies and children in this game prior to the Labor of Love update, but there are now more realistic depictions of it including visibly pregnant women, new animations and conversations, as well as a productivity boost for the player during the pregnancy and while the mother takes care of the child. In this game, players go on to play as their children after the death of their characters. Additionally, pregnant women will stop working during their second term.</p><p>This free update is also accompanied by a paid DLC called The Exquisite Pack. The cosmetic options include two new outfits: a dress and jewelry for a female character and something resembling formal wear for the men. The DLC also gives players an exquisite sword, new hairstyles and mustache designs, as well 13 emblem patterns for players' settlements.</p><p>From now through December 18 at 7:00 AM PST, Medieval Dynasty and The Exquisite Pack are on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4159030/Medieval_Dynasty__Exquisite_Pack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The core game is available for half of its regular price, which comes out to $17.50, while the DLC is only slightly discounted to $3.99. The previous Medieval Dynasty expansion, Echoes of Nature, is also for sale at the $3.99 price.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/09/cloudheim-early-access-review/</link>
            <guid>1376998</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Ragnarok shattered the world, but don’t worry, you have the chance to shape what comes next. As openings go, Cloudheim certainly knows how to put a lot on your shoulders, but, as Noodle Cat bring their one-to-four-player physics-based action adventure into Early Access, you’ll find this is a burden that can be shared. Or kicked off a cliff, if you prefer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cloudheim - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjaBRTT2mzA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You start by choosing your appearance, which you can change at any time. Mana is the poster girl for the game, and her Viking warrior vibes and coloured hair felt like a good starting point for joining the game in Early Access, but there’s a great mix of characters to choose from, including otters and birdmen. Some are locked at the outset, requiring you to level up particular classes in order to gain access to them, but there’s plenty to get you started.</p>


<p>You can change class at any time by equipping new weapons, with four distinct paths to follow, from Runeblade’s ranged spellcasting, through the two melee-centric classes of Sentinel and Breaker, to the fast, combo-driven Ranger. It’s always nice to be offered the opportunity to switch, especially when you never quite know whether you’re going to gel with that class in the long run and it’s a scheme that’s paid dividends in games like Final Fantasy XIV. Hopefully, players will latch onto it here, especially as you can equip weapons from two different classes, and level up two at the same time.</p>
<p>You’re a Runari, a race known for their hardiness and protection from damage, which is a good way to explain away why you’re capable of a physics-defying triple jump, or why you can fall from great heights without a scratch. Following Ragnarok, the world and the Gods within it were irreparably damaged. But some of the Runari survived, awakened once more by Odin Shell, a flying turtle whose shell serves as your home base. From here, you’ll set off on exhilarating, action-packed quests, beating up monsters and searching for loot before returning to build up your homestead.</p>


<p>Your first moments with the game are spent learning the controls and exploring the ruins of an ancient structure. Cloudheim’s visuals are the immediate selling point, with attractive anime-inspired designs that go a step beyond those found in Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. In contrast, some of the UI elements look very out of place and basic, but then, this is Early Access, and you expect things not to be quite as polished across the board.</p>
<p>Cloudheim has one of the best kicks in gaming. Forget the previous holder of the title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a>, the moment that you realise you can boot enemies and objects around the world will be the moment that you instantly fall for Cloudheim’s charms. The physics-based combat feels hefty from the off, but launching a bad guy across a crevasse feels absolutely brilliant. The enemy designs are full of life too, and there’s a great deal of satisfaction to be had in kicking them directly into their best mate before smushing them with a giant hammer.</p>

<p>Combat is only one part of Cloudheim’s central schtick, though. Building up your homestead on the back of Odin Shell is a big part of the experience, with your upgrades and unlocks tied to the buildings and features you place down. Building is simple enough, though the large open space feels thoroughly underutilised to start with. It would be nice to have a more approachable, cosy space to start with, which you could then expand from – something like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-review/">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> would be great – but you can immediately make the place feel like your own.</p>
<p>The building controls are a little finicky. I found myself unsure at times, able to select and move some things while others seemed to stay resolutely in place, or selecting things that I wasn’t intending to. If anything, it feels like something that can be solved by a small change to the buttons used, but the foundations are certainly here.</p>

<p>You can play with up to four players – there’s also an experimental eight-player option – and there’s already a great sense of community and camaraderie in place. Anything you make in your base can be used by other players, and you can also set up shop here, filling tables with goods and becoming a central part of the local economy. The balance between your downtime and heading out on quests feels good – at a bare minimum, you do need materials to build things – but I can see lots of players getting thoroughly sidelined by building and shopkeeping in the long run.</p>
<p>Cloudheim’s first steps into Early Access are very enjoyable, and there’s a lot more here than you might find in other games taking that step. As it stands, this is a great-looking action-adventure, with seriously enjoyable combat, and one which is already well worth getting on board with.</p>

			<p>Following <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">its release earlier this year</a></strong>, the Nintendo Switch 2 has received multiple system updates that introduced new features to the system, improved backward compatibility with select original Switch titles, enhanced the system's stability for a better user experience and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-fixes-frustrating-bluetooth-issue-and-more/"><strong>fixed some critical issues</strong></a>. Today, the Japanese company started the December system update cycle with a new update that also launched for the original Switch.</p>



<p>The 21.1.0 system update for both systems is a minor system update that introduces <em>"<strong><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473#current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience,"</a></strong> </em>so all those expecting a major new feature, such as Home Menu themes, will be disappointed. The new update will be automatically downloaded and installed by both systems when connected online.</p>



<p>While the new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is still being examined by datamining experts such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OatmealDome</strong></a> to reveal all undocumented changes, Nintendo itself has confirmed that the new update fixes an issue that caused video playback in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate to malfunction, a change not listed in the official update notes. We will update this post if any further undocumented change is discovered in the coming days.</p>

            <p>Break out your finest middle-parted hairdo, as Leon Kennedy's in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resi 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resi 4</a> protagonist's presence has been leaked by the evil resident that is cover art being pushed out too early on the PlayStation Store, which is like Steam, but a bit more blue.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The art, which shows big Leon's bonce looming behind Requiem lead and FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, has been served to players who've pre-ordered the game's standard edition for their console boxes and subsequently tried to set it away pre-loading.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Capcom hadn't confirmed whether the man with the jacket would be in Requiem. This art popping up days before The Geoff Awards, which Resi Requiem's already been confirmed to be popping up at, seems to point to that appearance probably being when Capcom had planned to go 'oh look, it's jacket man'. Now, if that's the case and there's no other big news, you can maybe use the time for a well-earned mid-advert swarm breather.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Playstation for real this time accidentally just leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. Checked with some people to absolutely confirm this was real first, and it is. If you have the standard non-Deluxe Edition of RE9 on PS5, you can see this cover if try to schedule pre-loading. <a href="https://t.co/yZv69ecd2u">pic.twitter.com/yZv69ecd2u</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998347199311167788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>While this Leon leakage has just occurred  today, the last few days have also seen another bit of potential Requiem leakage squirm out of containment. Game retailers Gamestop briefly left some details which could hint at another character in their listing for the PC deluxe edition. As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1997535711323656529">Dusk Golem</a>, the listing mentioned "three exclusive outfits for Rosemary Winters" and "a unique cosmetic look for Rose’s visor" in some blurb about DLC packs.</p><p>Rosemary Winters, of course, is the daughter of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> protagonist Ethan Winters. Assuming she does turn out to be in the game, that leak doesn't make it clear if she'll just be popping in for a chat or getting the full playable character treatment. Whatever's the case, it would appear Capcom have her wardrobe sorted.</p>
<p>Moving away from who'll be in it, Capcom have said Resi Requiem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-wont-repeat-monster-hunter-wilds-technical-blunders-capcom-say">will dodge the technical gremlins</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has suffered since it emerged into the plains and began lobbing stuff at angry creatures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re already a week into December. The clock is ticking to secure your holiday gifts for all your friends, family, and loved ones. Luckily, even though both Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come to pass, you can still find some sweet deals still lingering. Take this Bluetooth Bose speaker for instance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6301/">The Bose SoundLink Max is normally priced at $399, but has come down to just $279 for a limited time. The 30% discount ends up saving you a whole $120.</a> This Bose speaker can deliver rich audio performance, rugged portability, and all-day battery life. Anyone can appreciate a good portable speaker, so if you’re out of ideas for what to get someone, this might just be your answer.</p>
<p>This Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth party speaker is capable of producing big stereo sound with a deep bass that can carry your next party. You can perfectly dial in the sound exactly how you want it when using the Bose app. Control EQ settings like bass, mid-range, and treble for the best sound wherever you take the party to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pairing is east. Just press and hold the Bluetooth buttons until the light blinks blue, then choose the Bose SoundLink Max in your device’s Bluetooth settings and voila! The speaker can even be connected to up to two deices at once. You’ll only be able to play audio from one at a time, but two people can have their phones connected to be able to queue up music. In addition to Bluetooth, the speaker includes a built-in 3.5mm AUX input, making it easy to connect turntables, CD players, MP3 players, or any device you prefer to run wired.</p>
<p>Nothing kills the mood like a dying battery. With up to 20 hours of battery life, the SoundLink Max ensures your music lasts from sunrise gatherings to late-night sessions. And thanks to its USB-C charging port, you can even power your phone or other devices directly from the speaker. A Bluetooth speaker doesn’t do you any good if you don’t have a working source to play the tunes from. If the SoundLink Max has juice, your phone does too.</p>



<h2>Rugged Portability</h2>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">Accidents happen. Drinks spill, rain comes out of nowhere, stuff gets dropped. That’s why the SoundLink Max is built with an IP67 rating, meaning it’s waterproof and dustproof. It’s also resistant to shocks and rust. You can toss it in the sand, use it poolside, or let it ride shotgun on a rugged camping trip without worrying about damage. This is a speaker designed to thrive where others fail.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">Portability meets style with the speaker’s soft, removable climbing-rope handle. Grab it and go to the beach, a backyard hangout, a rooftop gathering, or your favorite hiking spot. You can upgrade to custom colored handles that are fun and eye-catching or a carrying strap your can throw over your shoulder.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">The Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth speaker comes in three awesome color options. Choose between blue dusk, citrus yellow, or the classic black. All three choices are currently discounted, but the steepest price change is on the blue dusk and citrus yellow versions.</p>

<p><strong>There are nine Military Camos to earn in Black Ops Warzone, with the requirements being the same across all weapons and requiring Eliminations.</strong></p>

    <p><span>A message from director Shoon T.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > C#4R4CT3R [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/c4r4ct3r">C#4R4CT3R</a> has delayed “lo-fi psycho-thriller <a title="Genres > Romance Visual Novel [92 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel/romance-visual-novel">romance adventure</a>” from its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/lo-fi-psycho-thriller-romance-adventure-game-rain98-announced-for-consoles-pc">previously planned</a> 2025 release window to 2026. It will be available for unspecified consoles and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,000 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3498720/Rain98/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. <span id="more-1012672"></span></p><p>In a message director Shoon T shared further insight behind the delay, the vision for the game going forward, and the path toward completing development.</p><p>Here is the message in full:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Director’s Message</strong></p><p>Hello, everyone. This is Shoon T, director of <em><a title="Games > Rain98 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rain98">Rain98</a></em>.</p><p>We have decided to shift our release target for <em>Rain98</em> to 2026 to deliver the game at the level of quality we believe it deserves. I sincerely apologize to all the players who have been looking forward to it, and I would like to explain how we arrived at this decision.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Why We Need More Time</strong></p><p>After starting development at full scale in April 2025, we have showcased <em>Rain98</em> to hundreds of players at events around the world, including BitSummit, PAX East, and Tokyo Game Show.</p><p>The amount of insightful player feedback we received from these events has helped sharpen and define the image of the game in our minds, which is much more than we had first anticipated.</p><p>With every event, we became more and more convinced that we could go deeper with this game.</p><p><em>Rain98</em> is not meant to be a game that ends the second you see the end credits. We want the experience of playing it to linger with you for a long time, and to be as impactful as the iconic scenes from anime and movies that reside in the popular imagination for generations. We realized that in order to achieve that, we would need to pour even more effort into it. We would need to put every last bit of our soul into this game.</p><p>Apart from the “part-time job” minigame already showcased in the demo version in events, the full release will include a wider array of experiences to evoke daily life in Tokyo in the late ’90s.</p><p>These interactive elements are designed to be more than simple gimmicks. They connect naturally to character psychology, the game’s narrative tone, and the thick, dark, rainy atmosphere of the story.</p><p>Preparing all of this with the care it takes requires additional development time.</p><p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p><p><em>Rain98</em> has now surpassed 45,000 wishlists on Steam, and we’ve received messages of support and excitement from all over the world. The fact that so many people are supporting us despite the very limited amount of information we’ve released is more than we could ever ask for, and this really helps us stay motivated every single day.</p><p>Let me take this opportunity to thank all of you.</p><p>Although <em>Rain98</em> has been postponed, we will be more open with our communication and will regularly share updates on development progress, plans for events, new demo versions, and more on our Steam Community and Discord.</p><p><strong>■ In Closing</strong></p><p><em>Rain98</em> will be worth the wait.</p><p>We still have much to learn when it comes to development, so we ask that you be patient and keep encouraging us through this journey. Our whole team is working tirelessly to share <em>Rain98</em>‘s story with you as soon as possible.</p><p>—Shoon T, Director</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/rain98-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

                <p>As The Game Awards draws closer, everyone's attention right now is on a mysterious demonic monolith that is teasing <em>something</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">First seen in the Mojave Desert</a>--and described by TGA host Geoff Keighley as being pure "regal.inspiring.thickness" as it stood there--the monolith has now been spotted in Los Angeles. It's not clear if this is the same monolith as the one in the desert or a new one, and there's still no clue what this piece of aura-farming architecture is teasing yet.</p><p>One franchise that it's probably not linked to? Battlefield, as Battlefield Studios senior director of integrated communications Andy McNamara snapped a photo of the monolith and <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1998267455622586639" rel="nofollow ">mentioned that it wasn't linked to EA's FPS franchise</a>.</p><p>Beyond that, there have been plenty more guesses as to what the demonic monolith will reveal. Some people have speculated that it could be teasing the next Diablo 4 expansion or The Elder Scrolls 6--industry reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-17#post-148370662" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims it's not related</a> to either IP--and CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2 being hinted at.

<figure data-uuid="2c836875913a2"><a title="Leon Kennedy - RE6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2c836875913a2/leon-kennedy-re6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: IGN</em></figcaption></figure><p>Leon Kennedy has finally been confirmed to appear in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>; though perhaps not in the way that Capcom had hoped.</p>
<p>Yes, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-leak-reveals">IGN</a>, the veteran character now shows up via the PSN store when users go to the pre-download page. The updated key art shows Leon in the background behind the game's other key protagonist, Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<p>As for Leon himself, he is sporting a similar jacket to his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, while his signature hairdo is well and truly present. He certainly comes across more grizzled than previous appearances; almost like a cross between Resident Evil 4 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0tkqysn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>It's likely that Leon's official reveal was scheduled for the game's upcoming new trailer during The Game Awards, but the cat is out of the bag.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the image in full:</p>
<figure data-uuid="1e3350d9795bc"><a title="Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e3350d9795bc/requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: IGN</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom has remained tightlipped on Leon's appearance in Requiem, though the company has consistently described the game as a mix between more classic survival horror gameplay and action-oriented scenes.</p>
<p>It's likely, then, that Grace Ashcroft will feature in the slower, more horror-focused sections, while Leon – being the hardened agent that he is – will take on the more action-heavy set pieces.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rumours that Leon Kennedy would feature in the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem have been circling the internet for a while and it looks like the PlayStation Store has confirmed this via pre-order icon.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>@AestheticGamer1 on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998347199311167788/photo/1"> Twitter</a> spotted the image and states “If you have the standard non-Deluxe Edition of RE9 on PS5, you can see this cover if try to schedule pre-loading.”</span></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem stars Grace Ashcroft and&nbsp; the story drags her back to Raccoon City, 30 years on from its destruction in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. She follows the trail of strange deaths at the Renwood Hotel as an FBI technical analyst, and that location is also where her mother was murdered eight years previously.</p>
<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi has previously spoken about on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear.&nbsp; He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been considered to be the lead character for this new game but was rejected.</p>

<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>
<p>Given that statement it may be that Leon is a non-playable character and may pop up to help, or even hinder, Grace.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-switch-2-along-with-resident-evil-biohazard-and-village/">recently revealed</a> that a trio of Resident Evil games are heading to Nintendo Switch with Resident Evil 7, aka Resident Evil Biohazard, and Resident Evil 8, aka Resident Evil Village, all launching on the same day as the Resident Evil Requiem.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-clears-out-playstation-vr2-at-its-lowest-price-as-holiday-stock-dump-begins-while-meta-quest-stays-full-price-2000651622</link>
            <guid>1376956</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking for a more immersive way to play your favorite titles, where the digital world becomes your reality in every sense, you need a VR set in your setup. These not only offer better visuals, but also unique sensations based on whatever’s happening in the game, pulling you into action.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">PlayStation owners should consider grabbing the PSVR2, especially now that it’s going at a 25% discount at Amazon.</a> This brings its usual $400 price down to $299, which, while not the lowest price ever, is still not bad considering all the features the bundle comes packed with. It’s open to all shoppers, and you don’t have to worry about any delivery charges either. Just be sure to grab it quick. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for this one, but we’re not expecting it to stick around for more than a couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Visuals and Sound</h2>
<p>The bundle includes the PlayStation VR2 headset and a pair of Sense controllers. The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. There’s support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like they’re happening right in your living room.</p>
<p>For instance, when cars race past, you’ll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone can’t offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, there’s 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if you’re right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on what’s happening in the real world with the See-through View function.</p>



<p>As for the controllers – these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when you’re not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when you’re just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like you’re a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all that’s happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount.</a> Amazon won’t be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>

Kennedy has been confirmed to appear in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> — via a leaked image on the PlayStation Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reveal of new cover art for the game featuring Leon finally puts to bed one of this year's biggest gaming mysteries — something developer Capcom has itself refused to address — just days ahead of Requiem's appearance at The Game Awards. Presumably we'll see Leon announced officially there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, Resident Evil fans began spotting the new cover art appearing on PlayStation 5 consoles in the pre-download screen for owners of the standard (non-Deluxe) version of the game. IGN has now verified this ourselves, and can confirm the image is legitimate. Leon is real.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251209-113722-1765280392352.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon S. Kennedy on Resident Evil: Requiem's cover. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's cover shows a stubbled and haggard-looking Leon looming over Requiem's other main protagonist, Grace Ashcroft. In his appearance, Leon looks most similar to his iconic look from Resident Evil 4, his floppy hair set off by a snazzy leather jacket, its collar lined with fur.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors have persisted for months over Leon's involvement in Resident Evil: Requiem, with Capcom <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">specifically declining to answer IGN's questions over the character</a> back at Gamescom in August. The game's developers have even suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon would be a poor fit as a protagonist for the game's quieter sections</a> as he is now too grizzled to be scared. But through all of this, Capcom left itself with just enough wiggle room for Leon to still be lurking somewhere — presumably during Requiem's more action-packed sequences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a better look at Resident Evil: Requiem's new box art, with Leon's look shown in more detail:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/g7uethpbiaazzaq-1765283158546.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil: Requiem's new Leon-enhanced cover. Image credit: PlayStation.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Capcom's secrecy, persistent leaks pointed to Leon's presence in Requiem, while the game's story itself seems like it's built around the character's return. Requiem returns the franchise to its roots in Raccoon City, where Leon was once a rookie cop, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">its "overarching narrative" that was begun 30 years ago</a>, as of next year. An early trailer for the game even showed the remnants of his former Raccoon City Police Department, hinting at his involvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, amid frenzied speculation, Capcom has been keen to keep fan expectations in check. Last month, Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-producer-teases-characters-involved-in-the-raccoon-city-incident-are-in-the-game">finally confirmed</a> that "yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in" but said that fans shouldn't "over-expect or hype it." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout all this, Capcom had kept the secret the quiet — up until today, just 80 days from the game's February 27, 2026 launch date, and little more than 48 hours from its big splash at The Game Awards this Thursday — where gameplay featuring Leon is now all but certain to be fully revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Leon's involvement now being confirmed, Requiem still has plenty of secrets left in store. Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-gamestop-listing-leaves-fans-bewildered-by-mentioning-a-shock-second-character-and-its-not-leon">a GameStop listing referenced yet another unrevealed character, Rosemary Winters</a>, who fans have suggested will play a more minor role. And what will become of these characters, as Requiem seemingly ties a bow on the stories of the franchise so far? Will Leon get to retire and hang his jacket up in peace? Time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
