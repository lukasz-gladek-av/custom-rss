		<p>You know how Goro Majima has an eye patch, and how pirates stereotypically have eye patches too? Well, what if Majima was a pirate? In Hawaii? That’s the basic premise of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, the self explanatory spin-off coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 28th February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCmDF0NqZQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Half a year after teaming up with Kiryu for the battle at the Millenium Tower, Goro Majima washes up on a remote island with no memories at all, not even his name. He embarks on a new adventure with teenage islander Noah to regain those memories and get ahead in this topsy-turvy world.</p>
<p>That will take them in conflict with criminals, modern-day pirates (who dress like ye olde pirates – and other scoundrels, who are all chasing after a legendary treasure. Thankfully you’ll have your own pirate crew backing you up, with real-time cannon battles against other ships on the open seas, before switching up to hand-to-hand after boarding their ships. Here you can switch between Majima’s Mad Dog and piratical Sea Dog fighting styles, the latter letting him wield a cutlass and other buccaneer gear.</p>
<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series, which will be helmed by former&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>showrunner Adi Shankar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set to debut in April 2025,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will, of course, revolve around the adventures of longtime series protagonist Dante. If you're not a fan of the 2013 reboot, you'll be pleased to know we're very much in classic&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>territory when it comes to Dante's design.</p>
<p>Shankar first announced the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania">back in 2018</a>, and we got our first look at the animation style and tone of the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series">last year</a>, but this new trailer gives a more involved glimpse into the show's setting and characteristically stylish action sequences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/devil-may-cry-animated-series-dante_0.jpg?itok=P5hsLL69 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/devil-may-cry-animated-series-dante_0.jpg?itok=e3CqiPMv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that sure does look like Dante alright.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer doesn't give a ton away about what the story will be, but it does show Dante leaping out of an exploding plane, battling demons, and, of course, retrieving his pistols from a pizza box, so it's definitely&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>.</p>
<p>You can take a look at Netflix's trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series right here. We don't know exactly when it debuts yet, but this trailer should get you excited for it, at the very least.</p>

<h2>What else is Netflix working on in the gaming space?</h2>
<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, we also got to see some of the other things Netflix is working on when it comes to gaming-adjacent shows.</p>
<p>For a start, Netflix is working alongside CD Projekt Red for another animated series based on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, although whether this one will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-edgerunners-brilliantly-uses-elements-from-game">an anime like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-edgerunners-brilliantly-uses-elements-from-game">Edgerunners</a>&nbsp;</em>or a Western-produced show remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Netflix also revealed the release dates for the second season of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>adaptation&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>, which saw its first season launch back in 2021 to critical acclaim, prompting Riot to include one of its most beloved characters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">as a champion in&nbsp;<em>League</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first "Act" will premier on November 9th, followed by the second on November 16th and the third on November 23rd. Presumably, each Act will contain multiple episodes, although we don't know exactly how many there will be yet.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more on these Netflix projects, as well as all other things gaming adaptation-related.</p>

Colin Farrell plays the titular Penguin (whose name has, strangely, been changed from Oswald Cobblepott to Oz Cobb to try and “ground” the series) as mesmerizing and manipulative in this first scene, and he only gets better from there, propelling <em>The Penguin </em>forward like a motor-mouthed machine, at times eliciting empathy, at others disgust. Farrell is so effective, you can practically hear his name ringing out during next year’s awards season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Penguin</em> picks up right after the events of <em>The Batman</em>: Carmine Falcone is dead, the Riddler has flooded Gotham City, and crime is exponentially up in the wake of the disaster. Sensing a power vacuum and knowing that Falcone’s drug-addled son, Alberto, is due to take the throne, Oz immediately heads over to the family’s nightclub—the Iceberg Lounge—to raid the safe. When he’s discovered by an angry Alberto, he deflects, offering his condolences and a drink in Carmine’s honor. </p><p>Oz effortlessly manipulates Alberto; within minutes the two of them are half-drunk, reminiscing about the old mafioso until he offers the troubled young man some “drops”— a narcotic that you drop in your eye that induces a state of euphoria (or paranoia). As Alberto gets high, Oz tells him the story of the mob boss who ran his neighborhood when he was young, and how the entire community adored the man, mourning his death with a massive parade. But as Alberto begins to feel the narcotic set in, he doesn’t take Oz’s anecdote as a lovely reminder of his father’s legacy, he (somewhat rightfully, as you’ll quickly learn) picks up on the foot soldier’s desire to ascend the ranks. And so, he begins ruthlessly mocking him.<br></p><p>Alberto unleashes a flurry of insults at Oz from an armchair a few feet away with so much vitriol and hatred you pity the poor guy—you can see he’s faced this countless times before, this endless barrage of barbs based on his physical appearance. You see how it’s sunk deep into his soul, twisting him like gnarled tree roots, darkening his perspective on the world. Right when it all becomes too much, when Alberto seems like he won’t stop, right when you’re practically begging for someone to step in and end it, Oz casually pulls a gun and shoots Alberto point blank several times, barely moving in his seat. My mouth drops, an “Oh shit” escapes me that’s so loud our managing editor Carolyn Petit looks up from her seat several desks away.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-recommend-id="image://b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-recommend-id="image://b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here is where Farrell is especially spectacular: in the immediate aftermath, he lets out a barking, cruel laugh. He’s bested Alberto, he’s silenced someone insulting his looks, his intelligence, his honor. He holds the power. But that harsh laugh dies on his lips, and realization flits across his scarred face—this is the new head of the Falcone crime family, and he just shot him in the club they own. His eyes dart back and forth and I watch as a wave of emotions wash over him: frustration at his knee-jerk reaction, lingering anger at Alberto goading him into violence, fear at the repercussions.<br></p><p>“Oh fu-” Oz laments, his expletive cut off by the bold title card: <em>The Penguin</em>.<br></p><p>Farrell is <em>this</em> good for the entire episode (and series, to be quite honest). His voice, his visage, his physicality are all unrecognizable, and his dedicated adoption of this twisted, tortured soul offers a nuanced performance you so rarely see in a comic-book-inspired series. In one scene, he can make you let out a shocked peal of laughter (I choked on my coffee during a rant about the amount of pickles on his bodega sandwich), and in another he’ll make you despise him for manipulating a young, impressionable kid into doing his bidding. It’s an absolute masterclass in acting, and a delight to watch—and it only gets better from there.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fpenguin%2F5756c2bf-36f8-4890-b1f9-ef168f1d8e9c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fpenguin%2F5756c2bf-36f8-4890-b1f9-ef168f1d8e9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> episode two airs Sunday, September 29 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have revealed the next Like a Dragon game, and this time, everyone's favorite Yakuza loose cannon Goro Majima will be the star of it. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will see an amnesiac Majima reinvent himself as a pirate captain searching for a legendary treasure, an adventure that will see him cross swords with Hawaiian pirate gangs. The first trailer doesn't show much in terms of gameplay, but it does give a good look at Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's cast, the actors voicing them, and a release date of February 28, 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD_K05bgjSg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JD_K05bgjSg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the RGG Summit, producer Ryosuke Horii explained that the spin-off has a "very different" battle design when compared to the recent mainline games that use a turn-based RPG game. "It's fast-paced, and it has a lot of Majima's uniqueness, that’s what we aimed for," Horii said. Majima will be able to switch between two fighting styles--Mad Dog and Sea Dog--utilizing his signature Yakuza fighting moves and a weapons-based system where he goes all in on the pirate theme.</p><p>Additionally, Majima can take part in several minigames, something that has become a staple of Yakuza and Like a Dragon games over the years. Fans of the franchise have been spoiled for choice recently, as RGG Studio has steadily pumped out several games. Since 2020, the developer has released two mainline entries in the series, a remake of Like a Dragon: Ishin, and the spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6aJQ9hDFxk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T6aJQ9hDFxk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The most-recent entry, Like a Dragon: infinite Wealth, was released in January and saw current series protagonist Kasuga Ichiban team up with Kazuma Kiryu to explore Hawaii, uncover a major conspiracy, and crack some skulls along the way.</p><p>"It's the best of both Yakuza worlds coming together for a story about life, legacy, and the daunting realities of the world we live in--but, more than anything, atonement and the various forms it can take.

		<p>Sony has released PlayStation 5 system update 24.06-10.01.00, targeting game performance and stability, and for once, having such minimal patch notes are more than fine with us!</p>
<p>The download weighs in at around 1.2GB, with the only patch note being:</p>


<ul>
<li>We’ve improved system software performance and stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This update, however, comes after a week of certain games experiencing graphics issues and full blown crashes, most significantly Final Fantasy 16 – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/square-enix-investigate-final-fantasy-16-crashes-and-graphics-after-ps5-system-update/">Square Enix acknowledged the issues</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub-personalised-3d-audio-more/">Last week’s PS5 firmware update</a> laid the foundations for a global rollout of a new customisable Welcome Hub, and direct party invite sharing with links. Additionally, the personalised 3D audio system that was in testing for the last few months with users has now gone live for all players.</p>
<p>However, console system updates also include a lot of behind the scenes changes that can affect game performance, providing system-level optimisations for specific games, new API hooks and more – they’re similar to installing driver updates on PC, or new versions of Windows. Sony never details the changes made to that level of granularity, but something clearly went awry with last week’s update, affecting a handful of games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe.986832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ten days ago, publisher Focus Home Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 had sold over two million units a single day after launching globally.</p>
<p>Following up on that success, GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1837059344308871651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1837059344308871651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that, according to GSD data, Space Marine 2 had the second best-selling launch of 2024 in Europe so far, beating the likes of The Last of Us 2: Remastered, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth, Tekken 8, F1 24, WWE 24, Star Wars Outlaws, and Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The only game to sell more was Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>There's a caveat to that, though. Palworld and Black Myth: Wukong, arguably the two most successful game launches of the year, aren't considered in the data because GSD does not track their developers. Considering that Palworld had surpassed 15 million units as of February and that Black Myth: Wukong reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke 20 million units sold</a> in less than a month, it's easy to imagine the games kicking Space Marine 2 off the podium.</p>
<p>Still, Saber Interactive's latest release has been a success so far, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is more on the way</a>. Season 1 is set to add support for Ultrawide displays, Private PvE lobbies, and a Sparring Arena in the Battle Barge; Season 2 will introduce new PvE missions, a new enemy, a new Lethal difficulty, and a new weapon; Season 3 is also adding new PvE missions, a new PvP game mode, new PvP arenas, a new enemy, PvE Prestige ranks, and an expansion of the Battle Barge. To round up the first year of post-launch additions, Season 4 will introduce a Horde Mode, a new enemy, and a new weapon.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will also be <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-dlss3-fsr-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation on PC, boosting frame rates.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-stars-a-swashbuckling-majima.986829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has announced <i>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</i>, the next installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>series, and it'll let you play as Kazuma Kiryu's friend and rival Goro Majima.</p>
<p>The game was revealed during today's RGG Summit, and it seemingly takes place alongside this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">hugely successful</a>&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, showing what happened to Goro Majima while the events of that game were unfolding.</p>
<p>The trailer is narrated by Majima himself, who relates his experience of being washed up on the beach of an island off the coast of Hawaii. It's not Nele Island, but that's where Majima is trying to get to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-boarding.jpg?itok=H52lHSZr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-boarding.jpg?itok=3WvuhlXG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>is aiming to be the pirate fantasy&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones&nbsp;</em>never could.</figcaption></figure><p>Waking up with no memory of his identity, Majima is saved by a young boy called Noah and his baby tiger companion, and the two quickly become embroiled in what Majima calls "an all-out war for treasures unimaginable".</p>
<p>There's not much gameplay to speak of in the announcement trailer; it's mostly setting up the characteristically outlandish premise and highlighting some of the larger-than-life characters you'll meet throughout&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, not least Majima himself.</p>
<p>We do, however, get to see a brief clip of a bicycle minigame towards the end, and we also get a glimpse of the game's combat, which, it seems, will return to the action stylings of earlier games rather than espousing the turn-based combat of Ichiban's adventures.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>Per the Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>will also offer "exhilarating" ship battles, as well as the chance to assemble your very own pirate crew. In short, if you, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">like many others</a>, were disappointed by&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, this looks like the pirate fantasy for you.</p>
<p><i>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</i>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0177-PPSA24478_00-MAINGAME00000000/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/9ns00hqcz0cj" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the best PC specs for budding pilots hoping to get into the cockpit when Fight Simulator 2024 releases in November.</p>
<p>By utilising cloud data streaming, the install size has shrunk to a petite <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1837036417165197497">30GB</a>. However, Microsoft reckons you'll need a stonking 64GB RAM to run at the "ideal" spec, along with 12GB of VRAM, an RTX 4080, the 14700K, and a 100mbps internet connection.</p>

<p>The minimum specs are likely much more attainable, however, recommending a minimum 10mbps and 16GB RAM.</p>
<p>All versions will need Direct X Version DX12, though, and 50GB of storage available.</p> <div>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> is already shaping up to be pretty spectacular, but don't forget that for the very first time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-let-you-climb-out-your-plane-walk-a-trail-and-watch-the-sunset">players will be able to eject out of the cockpit</a> - uh, safely, I hope - to wander around.</p>
<p>As well as every airport, the team has now added glider airports, every oil rig, and every lighthouse in the world. That's alongside "hundreds of species of animals that run around", and it's also simulating "every ship on Earth" via their transponder signals - all of which you'll be able to land on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/20/what-we-played-the-plucky-squire-astro-bot-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s definitely ramping up to Christmas, and the reveal of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-limited-edition-30th-anniversary-ps5-consoles-look-fantastic/">30th Anniversary PlayStation consoles</a> in classic grey has reopened the question of whether a PS5 Pro is now an essential purchase. Because it’s a nice retro grey. Whatever your feelings about a piece of tech that lives inside a closed TV cabinet, it’s all very cool, and nice to see Sony going the extra mile by making literally everything grey.</p>
<p>When I’ve not been looking at pictures of consoles, I’ve been playing the wonderful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-plucky-squire-review/">The Plucky Squire</a>, the calming Caravan Sand Witch, Star Wars Outlaws and a bunch of other stuff inbetween.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played some demos including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/17/slopecrashers-preview-bird-and-board/">Slopecrashers</a>, Hush Hush High, and Pairs &amp; Perils. He’s also continued his playthrough of Final Fantasy XVI, saying, “I’m at a stage where it has now opened up after the first few hours. I’m enjoying it a lot. I also finished Beyond Galaxyland for review and that will be published next week.”</p>
<p>It’s also been some Star Wars Outlaws for <strong>Ade</strong>, who tells us, “I’ve been really enjoying it! It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the original films. Best Star Wars-y thing in years. Which, considering the low bar set by the recent TV shows, isn’t really saying much… nonetheless, Outlaws is very good by any standard”.</p>


<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Spider-Man 2, though he’s not been totally sold by it, “It seems to be more of the same so I didn’t bother playing much”, he continues, “I’ve also been playing Alan Wake Remastered which I finished, v good, Transformers Fall of Cybertron, just because, and Astro Bot. The God of War level in Astro Bot is better than the entirety of Ragnarok. Fact.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has also been enjoying an Astro Bot love in, “It has taken up most of my time this week and has been another perfect game for PlayStation Portal. Naturally, I’m going for a completionist run – although I rarely chase after trophies nowadays, Astro Bot offers some major incentives for those wanting that sweet PlayStation nostalgia rush.</p>
<p>That’s not all though, because “Speaking of trophies, now that the TimeSplitters trilogy on PS4 and PS5 support them, I’ve been playing the first game in the series. I’ve never played it properly despite sinking countless hours into both sequels and it still holds up pretty nicely. The PS2 emulation’s rewind feature adds a handy thematic twist, allowing me to effortlessly rerun levels and pull myself back from death’s door. This has been particularly useful during the nail-baiting challenges.”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> was one Bot from 100% completion on Astro when the game crashed. He cried, “I have to redo 7 of the hard levels!<br>
Beyond that I have played [[heavily redacted]]. It’s pretty cool, if you like that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing something he describes as, “A perfect party of nostalgia and homage that really pays tribute to the great games of the past while introducing fascinating new modes of control and interaction – but enough about Golden Axe: Beast Rider… More seriously, Astro Bot is just pure gaming joy distilled into an experience that constantly keeps me smiling. Beast Rider can fuck right off with its awful controls and instant death pits. I have been working through some reviews so expect What the Car and Squirrel With a Gun soon whilst another one is possibly embargoed but is a remaster of one of the most neglected Wii exclusives and the review will drop next week.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has caught up on the main story in Zenless Zone Zero, played and beaten Thank Goodness You’re Here and also Clickolding, and he’s been playing some Fortnite too! <strong>Tef</strong> had a little gaming time to himself, telling us, “I played a bit of that new Warhammer game. Warhammer….. Boltgun? Got to say, the graphics are really something.”</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Gamoc</strong> mostly played Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag, along with some other bits. He says, “I love Black Flag despite the stupid stuff, like trailing missions and boat stealth missions, I was worried revisiting would be rough because of those.”</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played? And are you tempted by any of the 30th Anniversary PlayStation gear? Maybe just a DualSense…</p>

It launches February 28, 2025..</p><p>A lengthy reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szhdoaEG21w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> showed Majima washed up on the beach of Rich Island, near Hawaii, looking worse for wear and helped by a child with a pet tiger. Majima introduced the clip himself as a story taking place six months prior, asking how the heck he ended up on a beach.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Reveal Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>It looks to directly feed off the story of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, with Majima dealing with repercussions caused by Ichiban Kasuga's involvement with the cult of Palekana on Nele Island. The trailer also showed Majima becoming a pirate captain himself.</p><p>Gameplay released showed Majima fighting on the main Hawaii map from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth alongside on ships and other new areas. Majima can fight in either the Mad Dog Style or the Sea Dog Style, and players can jump for the first time in the Yakuza series.</p><p>Yakuza fans have been awaiting this game's reveal for what feels like a long time. Even though the last mainline game, the colossal Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, arrived as the last mainline entry in January, RGG Studio has become known for its rapid releases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the last five years, for example, it released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p>Fans have been trying to figure out what this new entry would be since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-summit-showcase-to-reveal-next-yakuzalike-a-dragon-game-in-september">Sega announced the RGG Summit in August</a>, whether it would be the next mainline Yakuza/Like a Dragon entry, another spin-off game like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, another remake like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review">Yakuza: Kiwami</a> or Like a Dragon: Ishin, another game from spin-off series <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/20/judgment-review">Judgment</a>, or something else entirely.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>Atlus will sponsor the Haas racing team at this weekend's F1 Singapore Grand Prix to celebrate the forthcoming release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>If that seems like an odd pairing, there's actually a clear crossover. Metaphor features a red-headed elven knight called Hulkenberg, while Nico Hülkenberg is one of the drivers for the Haas F1 team.</p>
<p>Naturally, then, both Hulkenberg and the game's protagonist will adorn the noses of cars driven by Hülkenberg and teammate Kevin Magnussen respectively.</p>

<p>A grand high fantasy anime RPG and an F1 race fuelled by modern technology don't appear to have a lot in common. Atlus, though, would beg to differ.</p>
<p>"Overcoming fear and anxiety is a central theme in Metaphor: ReFantazio, and being featured on the racecars of Nico Hülkenberg and Kevin Magnussen - drivers known for defying the impossible - perfectly mirrors our game, where players beat the odds in their chase for the crown in the Royal Tournament," said Irvin Ducournau, director of marketing at Atlus.</p>
<p>"Partnering with MoneyGram Haas F1 Team ahead of the Singapore GP is a natural fit, as the high-stakes nature of Formula 1 aligns seamlessly with the competitive election mechanic in the game, where players gain followers in their own race for victory."</p>
<p>Ah, now it all makes sense!</p>

<p>Mark Morrell, the Haas team's director of marketing also commented: "This hotly anticipated game is visually spectacular and filled with all the speed, suspense and excitement you would expect from a Grand Prix weekend. It's our first partnership of this kind and we're looking forward to sharing the exhilarating world of Metaphor: ReFantazio with racing fans."</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-is-far-more-than-just-persona-in-fantasy-clothing-it-could-be-a-new-high-bar-for-the-genre">hands-on with Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> last month, and while I can't say I spent any time racing, I certainly got a taste of its competitive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-fantasy-election-adapts-personas-social-gameplay">election storyline</a>.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the next game from Atlus, the creators of the Persona and Shin Megami Tensei series, which launches on 11th October across Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new video shared online a few hours ago provides a better look at the Nintendo Switch 2 design and screen, comparing it with the current system as well.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xnzxnz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">小宁子 XNZ</a>, features a 3D-printed version of the console based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">recent leaks</a>, providing a much better look at it. The size and the bigger screen are obviously the biggest differences with the current Nintendo consoles, but every other feature in the design suggests that the upcoming console is indeed an evolution of its predecessor.</p>
<p><iframe title="【全网独家爆料】Switch 2 来了！你想知道的一切全在这里！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UArxpvOZV5M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the system having been in the works for quite some time, the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. As such, there's little that is currently known for certain about the system other than the fact that it is in the works. According to rumors, its performance should be close to the Xbox Series S, potentially with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality</a> if the system will indeed feature the rumored 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM. Also, the console is said to support NVIDIA DLSS and Ray Reconstrunction, which should give the system an edge, although it is expected it will run games at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">a lower framerate</a> than the Steam Deck due to its CPU.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-interview-discussing-setting-gameplay-pc-features/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan was among many games placed under the spotlight during this year's Gamescom, and for good reason. The game in development by Neople is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly promising</a>, thanks to an interesting setting, high production values, and a hardcore action role-playing game experience inspired by the Souls series, whose quality feels quite close to that of its illustrious inspiration.</p>
<p>After trying out The First Berserker: Khazan, I had the chance to talk with game director JunHo Lee and Neople CEO Myeongjin Yun about the game's settings, mechanics, and PC-exclusive features like NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Deep Dive on Weapons, Action, and Combat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ddf0s9PaAnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan is based on the Dungeon and Fighter series, which is not very well known in the West. Is the game a good introduction to the franchise?</strong></p>
<p>We love Dungeon and Fighter, and we have been playing it for a long time. We started The First Berserker: Khazan project because we wanted more people to enjoy the series, and we focused mostly on two things during development. We wanted to make a game that fans of Dungeon Fighter would enjoy, but also those who didn't know much about the series. We put a lot of effort into appealing to this untapped player base and making them more interested in the series, so the game is most definitely a good starting point.</p>
<p><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan feels a lot like the Dark Souls series. In the past few years, we have seen many Soulslike games, and it has become a little difficult to emerge. What makes the game stand out?</strong></p>
<p>When we started working on the game, we wanted to leverage some of the features that make the Dungeon and Fighter series unique, such as fast-paced and intense combat and high challenge level. Ultimately, we brought these features into a 3D action game while also thinking about what kind of game players may enjoy. At the start of the adventure, it feels a bit like Dark Souls, with heavier combat and a high challenge level. But as the adventure proceeds, the main character becomes more powerful, finds new weapons, and unlocks new skills and abilities that change the experience into a more fast-paced one that's more in line with Dungeon and Fighter. In a way, it feels like the game's genre shifts midway, and this is what makes the game stand out the most.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned weapons. How many weapon types are in the game?</strong></p>
<p>The game features three weapon types - a dual-wielded sword and axe, a spear, and a greatsword. The number of total weapon types may feel small, but it actually isn't, as we consider the three weapons as three different characters. Each weapon comes with its set of skills, and by building Khazan with different gear, it's possible to empower different play styles for all weapons. The game also features gear sets in the vein of Diablo to provide further customization options. And if any of the choices the player has made, it is possible to fully respec Khazan and try out different things.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about items, is there a loot system?</strong></p>
<p>In The First Berserker: Khazan, players can farm certain items by defeating enemies repeatedly. However, the most valuable items are hidden away in the game's locations, so players will have to carefully look around to find them. This also makes exploration quite rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, games inspired by the Souls series started featuring different difficulty settings to allow less experienced players to enjoy them without getting frustrated by the high challenge level. Does The First Berserker: Khazan follow suit?</strong></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan features a single difficulty level, but we have used the game's content to address the difficulty issues, letting the player control the challenge level somewhat. If you want to experience a high challenge level, you can play the game normally. On the other hand, if you feel the action is too difficult, we have provided mechanics that can help the player, so by leveling up items or Khazan himself, battles will be more manageable. There's also a helper system designed to help players in the most difficult battles.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned a helper. Is it AI-controlled? Does the game feature any sort of multiplayer?</strong></p>
<p>The helper is AI-controlled, and there is no multiplayer at all.</p>
<p><strong>Any post-game content?</strong></p>
<p>More than post-game content, The First Berserker: Khazan features many reasons to play through the game again, such as multiple endings. In addition, the game features a lot of different builds that really change the way the game is played, so players can try them out and enjoy the game in a different light. Some of these builds cater to more experienced players, so they may be difficult to use during the first playthrough, but as the player's individual skills have increased, these may become viable.</p>
<p><strong>Is The First Berserker: Khazan getting additional content? Free or paid?</strong></p>
<p>We are working on additional content. We feel the base game will have enough content for its cost, so we want to provide content that will be worth the player's money. We will still have free updates, but the more meaningful additional content will come with paid content.</p>
<p><strong>Any PC-exclusive feature?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and the game will also support AMD FSR and Intel XeSS. No matter the platform, however, we are committed to delivering the best experience possible. That has been our priority from the start, and we are putting a lot of effort into optimizing the game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>

Details from Nintendo appear to have confirmed the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Once again, Nintendo has been secretive about the identity of its latest game's development team - even if the actual studio behind it isn't too much of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Fans had long expected Echoes of Wisdom, which shares a look and feel with the Nintendo Switch remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, to be made by the same studio. And indeed, this appears to be the case. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening on Switch was made by Grezzo, the Tokyo-based team that has collaborated with Nintendo on numerous Zelda handheld titles in the past, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-ocarina-time-3d">Ocarina of Time 3D</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-majoras-mask-3d">Majora's Mask 3D</a> for Nintendo 3DS, as well as the Switch port of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details seen by users who have pre-ordered Echoes of Wisdom show Nintendo and Grezzo mentioned in the game's trademarks.

<p>
Nintendo declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is currently also being secretive around the studio behind Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. The original studio behind the series, AlphaDream, closed down in 2019.
</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches next week - and after a chance to play it recently I came away thoroughly impressed. "Finally, this is Zelda's moment to shine," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reinvents-age-old-gameplay-as-the-series-finally-changes-its-star">Eurogamer's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's a pirates life for the Yakuza series. Earlier today, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The upcoming spin-off was announced during the RGG Summit livestream, and features recurring character Goro Majima swashing his buckles as the sole protagonist.</p>
<p>The game appears to take place after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, and sees poor ol' Goro washed up on the sandy shores of Rich Island, unsure of who he is or why he is there. Soon, however, he is embracing his inner-pirate to bombastic effect. I mean, why not! You can check out our first look at Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii in the video below.</p>

<p>As you can see, the combat in Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is very action based, with swords slashing and, of course, a good amount of rope swinging on board a pirate ship. Also, that water! Gosh, it looks divine. And a pirate hub! Yes, please do sign me up.</p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set to debut next year, on 28th February. It will launch across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4 and PC.</p>
<p>What do you think? Has Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii shivered your timbers, or do you think RGG needs to walk the plank?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, the next entry in the series by SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szhdoaEG21w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today for an early 2025 release.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series will star fan-favorite Goro Majima as he hunts down treasure and gets involved in some naval battles in Hawaii. The game will also be a direct sequel to Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, as Majima will have to deal with some of the consequences caused by Ichiban Kasuga's actions in the previous entries in the series. The reveal trailer also confirms that fans of the series won't have to wait much longer to experience Majima's treasure-hunting adventure, as the game will launch on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth serves as the real bridge between the Yakuza and Like a Dragon series into one cohesive experience. It’s the perfect sendoff for Kiryu and a passing of the torch to the plucky Ichiban Kasuga. In a lot of ways, Infinite Wealth builds upon the past with callbacks that series fans could appreciate. It’s a Japanese RPG experience that could only best be described as Ryu ga Gotoku Studio’s Metal Gear Solid 4 moment.</em></p>

            <p>The post-apocalyptic wastelands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world">Rain World</a> are stunning, brutal, and full of strange creatures that would like to eat your kittenish face. It's a landscape of wonder and pain, and it's about to get a little more wonderful and painful. The upcoming Watcher expansion, which adds new places to visit and a new type of slugcat to play as, will be coming out early next year, say the developers. There's a trailer to say so. Look at this slippery gastropodal feline, standing calmly in the rain, as if the torrential and lethal weight of the water will not crush that little fuzzy head. The gall!</p>

<p>It's coming out March 28th, 2025. We're not told precisely what the expansion is all about, only that this time the slugcat you control will be the Watcher, otherwise known as the "Nightcat". This dark critter has something of a cameo in the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-downpour-will-bring-co-op-mod-support-and-new-slugcats-in-early-2023">previous Downpour DLC</a>. You can play as the Nightcat in a multiplayer arena mode, for instance, and the adorable little Squirmle also shows up briefly towards the end of another slugcat's story campaign. </p>
<p>We're not told what abilities this slugcat has though, if any. In Downpour, each new variant of the slugcat sports special traits and characteristics. The prickly Spearmaster has needles in its body to use as weapons and climbing tools, for example, and the Saint uses a sticky tongue as a kind of grappling hook. But the Watcher? No idea. </p>
<p>Maybe the confident way the fuzzball stands in heavy rain implies an immunity to the game's most unconquerable environmental hazard? Or maybe all the mysterious talk of ripples and concentric rings is suggesting this slugcat has some ability to travel through time or space in a novel way. I don't know. But one thing is clear from the trailer. There will be a bunch of new areas to explore, and some of them look wildly different from the landscape's usual twisted urban swamp. Sand! Snow! Pink skies!</p>
<p>"The wilds that await will be unlike all that's come before," says a blurb for the DLC. "Unknown creatures stalk and climb and dive and hunt. New breeds rip and pluck and burrow and hide. Predator and prey redefined."</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>If you haven't tottered unsteadily into the post-apocalyptic landscapes of Rain World, I do recommend it, with the proviso that you consider playing on an easier difficulty than the default setting. This survival metroidvania (I don't know what else to call it) was <em>nails</em> when I played it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-review">for review</a>, and under time pressure I didn't have a perfect experience. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is a singular piece of work. It has both some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-extremely-thorough-grading-of-the-best-rain-in-video-games">best rain in games</a> and one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cats-in-games">best cats in games</a>. Its harsh and fascinating world has stayed with me in a way few games do. I sometimes look back on that review with a tinge of regret, a feeling like I was unable to fully meet the game on its own terms. Then again, this was before developers Videocult pumped a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-controls-patch">bunch of updates</a> into it and added that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-expansion-to-bring-easy-mode-multiplayer">nice easy mode</a> for sufferers like me. Some day I'll go back. If I can summon the courage to get past <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Leviathan">this thing</a> again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Kurihara identified four divisional patent applications that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company jointly registered after Palworld’s launch in January. A divisional patent contains isolated content from an already registered parent patent. The patent Kurihara believes is the focus here, Patent No. 7545191, describes, per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>:</p><blockquote>Aiming a capture item (Poké Ball) at a character placed on the field (Pokémon), releasing the capture item in a direction determined by player input, judgment of whether capturing is successful or not upon contact between the capture item and Pokémon, and changing of the Pokémon’s status to “owned by the player” when capturing is successful. In addition, the patent also covers the mechanic of having capture probability displayed to the player, regardless of whether it uses colors, graphics or numbers.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/20240920-37391-1726825630200.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Patent No. 7545191, owned by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Patent No. 7545191, alongside three related others, were only approved in August, which might help explain why it’s taken this long for Nintendo to announce its lawsuit. The parent patent of the four divisional patents was registered in December 2021, and thus, Automaton points out, are legally effective against Palworld, which launched January 2024. Nintendo has yet to officially reveal the patents it alleges Pocketpair has infringed.</p><p>It is worth noting that Palworld does include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, and this may prove the key to the lawsuit. Kurihara suggested Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed the four division patents for specific use in litigation against Palworld developer Pocketpair. As for Pocketpair, it’s said it will begrudgingly investigate the patent infringement claims while continuing to update Palworld despite the lawsuit, and apologized to players left concerned about the future of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s Pocketpair’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>Regarding the Lawsuit</blockquote><blockquote>Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.</blockquote><blockquote>We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.</blockquote><blockquote>At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.</blockquote><blockquote>Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.</blockquote><blockquote>It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.</blockquote><p>Players are now left wondering whether Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit will force Pocketpair to remove Palworld from sale or even shut the game down.</p><p>Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p>Speaking of Sony, Palworld is heavily rumored to be set for a PlayStation launch announcement at this month’s Tokyo Game Show. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-palworld-is-coming-to-playstation"><u>Pocketpair teased a PlayStation release back in June</u></a>, so this would come as little surprise. TGS runs from September 26 to 29.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing"><u>While player numbers have declined somewhat since Palworld’s explosive launch</u></a>, it remains one of the most-played games on Steam (Microsoft does not make Windows PC and Xbox player numbers public), sitting comfortably in the top 100 on Valve's platform.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>The scrolling beat ‘em up is a tried and tested genre. Since Kung Fu Master in 1984, and the many decades of iteration since, the mechanics of the walking whack ‘em up have become etched in stone. We could likely play one in our sleep. With all that history to draw upon, with so many refinements to include, with such a simple and accessible gameplay loop, it must be genuinely hard to make a bad scrolling beat ‘em these days. And yet, with The Karate Kid: Street Rumble, that’s exactly what developers Odaclick Game Studio have astonishingly managed to achieve.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Karate Kid: Street Rumble - Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOlN9i4eMCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thanks to the ongoing success of the TV show Cobra Kai, Karate Kid has enjoyed a resurgence not seen since the release of the original film way back in, would you believe it, 1984 – yes, the same year that Kung Fu Master saw its fateful debut. So, with that sort of convergence, it makes a lot of sense for a retro-inspired scrolling beater set around the events of the first three films to be brought karate-kicking into the world.</p>


<p>And The Karate Kid: Street Rumble certainly looks the part, bringing to mind the pixellated gorgeousness of Ubisoft’s Scott Pilgrim VS The World: The Game in its old-school aesthetic. But here the similarities end between that seminal beat ‘em up and Odaclick Game Studio’s latest.</p>
<p>Firstly, Street Rumble is frustratingly finicky to play. Attempting to tell whether your diminutive fighter is on the same plane as their foe is remarkably difficult, resulting in their devastating flurry of punches and kicks hitting little but thin air. Worse, even when you are set up in the right position, collision detection is iffy and there’s little sense of connection or impact to be found in the animation, leading to a fighting game with literally the worst feature: lacklustre fighting. Unfortunately, that’s what you spend all your time doing.</p>


<p>You and up to three friends via local co-op strut your way through twelve short levels, punching and kicking everyone you meet. The story is hung over the events and characters of the original films, but is told in such a humdrum way, you’ll soon be clicking through the text-based comic book-like cut scenes with wanton abandon. Seeing the classic cinematic moments recreated in a retro style is kind of fun, but that soon fades as you battle the same handful of tedious goons and their limited attack patterns again and again.</p>
<p>Combos and special moves are available to you and can be upgraded but none of the player characters differ to any interesting degree in their play style, leading to apathy soon setting in. Worse still, the trademarks of scrolling beat ‘em ups guaranteed to liven up proceedings, like weapon pick ‘ups or vehicles or creatures to ride are all curiously absent. If you thought boss fights might save the game, you’d sadly be mistaken, as encounters are banal to the extreme – most foes falling to your foursome’s flurry of fists in rapid order.</p>
<p>In short, the game is a massive ‘meh’. There’s nothing here to warrant raiding your wallet, even if you are the most devoted of Cobra Kai fans.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cobra Kai saved Karate Kid from drifting into irrelevance, plunging Daniel LaRusso and company into modern cultural consciousness. Sadly, there’s nothing about The Karate Kid: Street Rumble that will save it from fading into obscurity. And based on the apathetic fisticuffs the game offers, that’s probably a good thing.	</p></div>

Copying a mix of images and text from web sources (web-based Word docs or Google Docs) should work well, but other sources won't always be able to preserve the images. Copying and pasting an image individually seems to work just fine."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's now also possible to drag-and-drop images directly into the visual editor. As mentioned above, they can also be pasted in from a word document.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Any uploaded image will also be saved in the 'Custom Images' section, which itself has also received an update to more clearly present the uploaded images. And of course you can still work the previous way by specifically selecting and uploading files in the 'Upload Custom Images' section and then insert them into your description," continues the blog.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Swapping out images is a simple as hitting the 'edit' icon in the corner of any image that's already in the editor and choosing a different file. Other helpful WYSIWYG additions include s spellcheck functionality, keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo buttons, and automatic formatting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The editor can even be used to tweak 'Awards' and 'Special Announcements' sections.' Valve noted that anybody who prefers using the bbcode editor can switch between to new editor and the old one, but said the pivot "won't be pretty."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The new editor does continue to write bbcode, but is not optimized for human-readable presentation," reads the blog.
