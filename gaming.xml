            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-mighty-good-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a child, I quit playing soccer to become a Power Ranger. My dream did not come true.</p>
<p>That's the harsh reality of the world, but it looks like I might have another chance at achieving a childhood goal with the upcoming beat 'em up, <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em>. We got to check this game out on the show floor of PAX West 2024, so read below for our thoughts!</p>

<h2>Grab Some Friends for <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita</em>'<em>s</em> <em>Rewind</em></h2>
<p>The show floor of a convention is chaotic and loud, but the screams of joy from those playing <em>Rita's Rewind</em> could be heard across the entire building. I do not exaggerate when I say the folks playing this title were among the happiest in the crowd. A mix of nostalgia and rock solid, well-designed beat 'em up gameplay make <em>Rita's Rewind</em> an upcoming hit.</p>
<p>After actually playing <em>Rita's Rewind </em>for myself, the crowd's excitement is certainly understandable. The appeal of playing a beat 'em up with friends never dulls, and its entertainment value shoots up just a bit more with the bombastic, tokusatsu nature of <em>Power Rangers</em>.</p>
<p>In my demo, I played across two levels in the role of Blue Ranger, the very character I so wished to be as a child. Me and three other players button mashed to victory as our Power Rangers punched, grabbed, and jump-kicked across the stage, taking out goons unfortunate enough to be in our way.</p>

<p><em>Rita's Rewind</em> tends to err on the side of easy, at least for these two levels, but it's certainly a fun time. It does exactly what it needs to do and provides for a great outlet to unwind and beat up enemies. Your character's attacks aren't complicated to pull off, and thus, you get to do cool things. Dopamine is off the charts when you're brawling through the streets as a colorful group of badasses.</p>
<p>Brawling across a rooftop and fighting off the avian Tenga Warriors, we arrive in front of Goldar, which fans of the series will immediately recognize. We brawl away, avoiding (or soaking) attacks and eventually defeat him. But, in a surprise twist, Goldar enlarges and becomes the size of a skyscraper! That's when the demo ends, so clearly surprises are in store.</p>
<p>One point I want to heavily emphasize is the fantastic CRT filter Digital Eclipse created for <em>Rita's Rewind</em>. This filter isn't present in current screenshots, so it can be toggled. Just know that this is perhaps the most authentic CRT filter I've seen in a game.</p>

<p>The signature look of the CRT screen was authentically recreated on the demo floor's large, flat screen TV. It even replicated the slightly curved surface of the CRT, near the edges of the screen. <em>Rita's Rewind</em> will look great, filter or not, but this filter just brings it to the next level.</p>
<p>What else can I say about <em>Rita's Rewind</em>? It was a very quick demo, around 15 minutes in total, so I only got a short time with it, but it was a blast all the same. I just know I'll be grabbing a few friends so we can play this together, like any good beat 'em up deserves.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-aquarius-update-invites-you-to-relax-with-some-fishing.971829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Aquarius update, and it's perfect for you if you've been looking for a cozier and more relaxing way to spend your time exploring alien planets.</p>
<p>Aquarius follows recent&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update">Worlds Part I</a>, which introduced a graphical and performance overhaul to the game, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update">Orbital</a>, which allowed you to customize your starship and more.</p>
<p>This time around, though, Hello Games' ambitions are a little more small-scale, at least from a player perspective. The big new addition in Aquarius is the ability to fish; you can now grab your fishing rod and kick back, either alongside your buddies or solo, catching some weird space fish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update-fish-traps.jpg?itok=bWy5AZ5d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update-fish-traps.jpg?itok=a_6yo2it 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what alien creatures could be contained within those fish traps?</figcaption></figure><p>Fish you can catch in the Aquarius update range from "common minnow-like fish" through to "huge alien marine mammals", according to Hello Games, and there are plenty to find, so get out there and get fishin'.</p>
<p>To help you in your fishing endeavors, you'll have access to a deployable Exo-Skiff, which can float over water and hold its own cold storage inventory. It's ideal for keeping fish once you've caught them.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to build automated fish traps to help you catch fish while you're off doing other things. Once you've caught your fish - however you've done it - you can then use them in new cooking recipes and ingredient combinations.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also find a new page in the Wonders Catalogue, which lets you document all of the weird space fish you've caught and where you found them.</p>

<p>There's tons of other stuff to discover in the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Aquarius update besides fishing, too. You can read a full rundown of everything that's in the update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here on the game's official website</a>.</p>
<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and so is the Aquarius update. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-is-out-and-it-kinda-sucks.971826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros has released the very first teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, showing off what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, and it looks...well, pretty bad, to be honest.</p>
<p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, for 'tis its name, will star Jason Momoa, Jack Black, and Jennifer Coolidge, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>'s Emma Myers,&nbsp;<em>The Color Purple</em>'s Danielle Brooks, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen of&nbsp;<em>Just Mercy&nbsp;</em>fame.</p>
<p>Momoa, Hansen, Myers, and Brooks play people from the real world who find themselves transported into a magical cubic world where creativity is king. Together with Black's Steve, they must journey through this world, protect it from monsters like Piglins and Zombies, and "reconnect" with their creative qualities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-movie-trailer-jason-momoa.jpg?itok=MGVE9B1D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-movie-trailer-jason-momoa.jpg?itok=WCJnwNh7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will star Jason Momoa and Jack Black.</figcaption></figure><p>The movie is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Nacho Libre&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Napoleon Dynamite&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess, and the music comes courtesy of Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, who also wrote the soundtracks for&nbsp;<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Lego Movie</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>(together with Wataru Hokoyama in the latter case).</p>
<p>Honestly, if you ask me, the trailer's looking pretty rough. Sure, it's visually impressive on a surface level, but the aesthetic looks off for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>; it's too high-fidelity, too polished, too clean.</p>
<p>That's to say nothing of the writing, which, to me, feels like your bog-standard bland Hollywood "well, that happened"-level snarky comedy. The day the Marvel Cinematic Universe stops infecting the writing approach of every other light-hearted franchise-minded movie out there will be a happy day indeed.</p>
<p>Should you wish to, you can see the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you feel as I do about the trailer, then you can take solace in the fact that&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>adaptation we're getting; an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix">animated series is also in the works</a> over at Netflix.</p>
<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>arrives in theaters on April 2nd. I look forward to it taking roughly all the money in the world regardless of its quality.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6.971823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
If somebody grabs you from behind and turns you into a human shield in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, they can drag you around for about five seconds before you die, assuming they don't execute you early. Here are 12 things you can do in those five seconds:
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
1) Lean back in your chair, throw your arms up and luxuriously stretch out your shoulder muscles, while gazing through the window opposite at the sun and clouds and savouring anew the wonder and strangeness of being alive, on this particular day in this particular place on this particular ball of rock, in a vast and empty cosmos
</p>
<p>
2) Switch windows and complete a move order in the excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arco">Arco</a>, a tactics RPG with freeze-time combat, set in a fantastical version of South America
</p>
<p>
3) Be the bigger person and congratulate your captor over the game's proximity chat. Say something like: "Oh my heavens, what an excellent flanking manoeuvre! You certainly called <em>my</em> duty."
</p>
<p>
4) Explain to your captor that they have blundered right into your trap. How could they have fallen for such an obvious ruse? Truly, it would be laughable if it weren't so <em>pathetic</em>.
</p>
<p>
5) Seize the opportunity to appraise the battle in pop-out third-person view. This is your chance to make note of future cover positions, and check out everybody else's usage of the new omnimovement system, without having to worry about hitting them. Generally, when I'm fighting somebody who knows how to omnimove in Blops 6 it feels like shooting at spiders. Very large spiders with assault rifles.
</p>
<p>
6) Ingest and chew exactly one mouthful of regular-flavoured Pot Noodle
</p>
<p>
7) Spit out exactly one mouthful of regular-flavoured Pot Noodle, because that shit has been on your desk since Friday, you really need to give the room a once-over before your folks get home - oh god, what time is it, how is it already 4pm
</p>
<p>
8) Unleash your patented nonsensical catchphrase. "There goes the barnyard, and you can tell 'em I said so!" "Snoot's as good as a slap to a whistle on Wednesday, Reverend!"
</p>
<p>
9) Don't just monologue over proximity chat - rediscover the lost art of conversation. Perhaps your captor is experiencing tough times and could benefit from a kind word from a passing stranger. Be sure to prepare some brief, supportive quotes in advance. For example: "The heart is the toughest part of the body - tenderness is in the hands" (Carolyn Forché).
</p>
<p>
10) Loudly and derisively compare the meatshield mechanic in Blops 6 to meatshielding in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series and especially Gears Of War 3, which was superior in terms of both visual flair and intricacy of execution. Kids today wouldn't know a meatshield from a cover-mantle. You can't even turn me into a human bomb, you <em>poseur</em>.
</p>
<p>
11) Try to pass yourself off as the in-game match commentator. We're losing A!
</p>
<p>
12) Take a few seconds to drink in the spectacle of your character being abducted. Nod approvingly at your surgical choice of cosmetics, the perfection of your skin-and-camo accessorisation. Not many people can look fabulous while being hauled around like a mattress, but once again, you've managed it.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/five-questions-about-gamings-future-with-a-video-game-analyst/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>One of my favorite follows <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella?ref=remapradio.com"><u>on the cursed social network formerly known as Twitter is Mat Piscatella</u></a>, executive director and video game industry advisor at Circana, a company that analyzes and tracks consumer behavior. In other words, they track video game sales and trends, and try to figure out where the industry’s been, where it’s at, and where it’s going.</p><p>For old heads, you might remember Circana as the NPD Group. Back when there used to be semi-public access to video game sales information, the NPD Group’s monthly data drops were legendary. It was the “Steam concurrents” of the Obama era, a small but informative glimpse into understanding whether a game you were hoping might get a sequel had actually sold well.</p><p>Like I said, Piscatella is a great follow because he isn’t afraid to often spit back at the many, many weirdos who confront him for the sin of sharing context about how video games are doing.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Enthusiast Gaming Forum,</p><p>If you're gonna discount the success of Switch sales because it's a conncected/portable hybrid device, please discount the success of PS2 being a gaming/DVD player hybrid device.</p><p>Or, better yet, don't discount the success of either idk.</p></div>— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1822648179600576882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=remapradio.com">August 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Consider this a potential setup for a podcast appearance, but I had an opportunity to run a few questions by him <a href="https://www.circana.com/intelligence/press-releases/2024/u-s-video-game-market-to-decline-in-2024-but-circana-forecasts-2025-rebound/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>because Circana released its “Future of Video Game Report”</u></a> that looks at 2024’s troubles—sluggish hardware, a continued post-COVID bump sales hangover, a distinct lack of Switch 2 or Grand Theft Auto VI—and why, with some luck, 2025 might be different.&nbsp;</p><p>Given how much we’ve talked on Remap Radio about the seemingly never ending layoffs and the “survive to 2025” mentality that’s gathered amongst developers, I wanted to call in an expert.</p><p>What are the reasons for optimism? And where might it all go wrong?</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Please, lord, give me an updated Steam Deck and a new Switch.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Your report suggests the video game industry is looking at a “rebound” in 2025 because of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> and the expectation that Nintendo will release new hardware. I keep hearing that phrase “survive until ‘25,” aka just hold on until 2025. What does a “rebound” look like, though? Fewer layoffs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In this case, it would be mid to high single-digit percentage growth in consumer spending, and a return of some players that have lapsed following the peak of video game engagement seen in 2021. The challenge is that the market is shifting even more into winners and everyone else—meaning overall spending growth is expected in 2025, but the big winners of this growth are likely to be Take-Two Interactive and Nintendo.</p><p>However, not all developers or publishers will benefit equally. What may happen is a return of investment into other areas of game development helped by the growth in overall spending, which could theoretically ease the pressure we've seen over the past couple of years that has resulted in so many layoffs and closures—this is not guaranteed.</p><p>The video game market continues to be challenged by the “forever games” like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and Call of Duty, which continue to dominate player count and engagement. These games have fostered deep connections with the player base through continual updates and social hooks.&nbsp;</p><p>While in the past, a new game would have to compete mainly against other new games in its release window, now the biggest competitor to any new game entering the market is <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><strong>If 2025 is a rebound year, how would you characterize 2024? I feel like I'm drowning in a lot of good games to play, and yet layoffs are regular and enormous.</strong></p><p>Spending on video game products is up slightly in 2024 year-to-date compared to last year. However, this small gain has been mainly driven by mobile, with<em> Monopoly Go </em>doing most of the heavy lifting. There are great new games, sure, but engagement (and spending) is tending to pool at the very high end of the market, with the biggest games (particularly games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and other forever games) taking more and more of the overall pie.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding breakout success for a new title is more like winning the lottery now. It's not enough to have a good game—it requires a lot of hard work, perfect timing, and more than a little luck. </p><figure><figcaption><span>A deep source of pain for many parents—and many video game companies chasing its profits.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>People expected both<em> Grand Theft Auto VI </em>and new Nintendo hardware this year. It's hard to imagine it slips out of 2025, but <em>Grand Theft Auto VI c</em>ertainly could. What happens if one, or both, don't arrive in 2025?</strong></p><p>It's likely to be the difference between mid-to-high single-digit percentage increases in consumer spending on video games and mid-to-high single-digit percentage declines in 2025. We're on the downside of the PlayStation 5/Xbox Series generation, and the Switch is very late in its cycle. We still have the pressures of higher prices in everyday spending categories like food and more desire from consumers to spend on experiences, such as travel.&nbsp;</p><p>The mass market consumer needs a push to spend more on gaming, especially if they can play <em>Fortnite </em>or a free-to-play mobile game to scratch the gaming itch. <em>EA Sports College Football 2</em>5 did exactly this, bringing a significant number of lapsed players back to the console space, generating sales of not just the game but also of hardware and accessories. <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> and a Switch successor are likely to do the same, but to an even bigger extent.</p><p><strong>In the report, you noted the decline of physical media. Do you think we'll even have physical media with the next generation of consoles? For game companies, what does physical media represent? Why is it still important to them, if it is at all?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm expecting one more generation of physical media for PlayStation, perhaps two more for Nintendo, but Xbox Series may be the last Xbox generation with physical media—we'll have to wait and see on that one. Some players certainly prefer physical media, especially collectors and families. There is also a convenience factor for those with limited or spotty internet access.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at purchasing behavior, more and more consumers are choosing the digital route, with this adoption rate increasing over time. Physical media is much more nice-to-have than need-to-have at the moment, although there are certainly benefits to having a physical release.</p><p>However, I don't expect the digital adoption trend to slow down.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uE0XFJSVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4 - Absolute Doom | Official Season Trailer"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Part of the problem the last few years has been a change in spending habits from COVID-19. Was any of that real? Can the industry realistically try to capture that kind of attention, interest, and spending again, or was it all completely a mirage?</strong></p><p>Everyone who ever dreamed of spending more time playing video games did so during 2020-21. We know the ceiling for both the percentage of people who want to play video games and how many hours they'd like to play if they could play all they wished. Are we going to reach the same levels of player count and engagement again when there are so many other draws on their attention and time compared to 2020 or 2021? Not anytime soon, if we ever do.&nbsp;</p><p>As I see it, the video game market went from a growth market to mature practically overnight. Meaning, since <em>Pong</em>, the video game market has continued to grow as more and more people have discovered gaming over time. But in 2020-21, a huge influx of players and time found their way to the video game market and many of them liked it and stuck around. Others have again left gaming, having been pulled away by other things. So now, it's more about optimization of the player base rather than pursuing more organic growth by finding new players.&nbsp;</p><p>This has been a painful transition in thinking for many in the industry, especially those who assumed that player growth would continue forever, especially after the boom seen in 2020-21.&nbsp;</p>

And some players have determined that jumping off cliffs in Rivalry mode matches, which award the most XP of any mode, is the fastest way to achieve that. </p><p>A video clip shared by YouTuber Real Radec <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1831041419756388429%7Ctwgr%5Ea5a66a010415d21f8856122ebbe9db3a6acc48eb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1831041419756388429&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1831041419756388429%7Ctwgr%5Ea5a66a010415d21f8856122ebbe9db3a6acc48eb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1831041419756388429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that went viral</a></span> showed exactly that, with players jumping off at the start of each round of the elimination mode to clear a match as fast as possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/genepark/status/1831074388017381704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/genepark/status/1831074388017381704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Washington Post</em> critic Gene Park</a></span> hopped into a match and was able to replicate the results.

That’s clearly something that’s meant to be achieved over weeks if not months, since new weekly and seasonal jobs net you tons of bonus XP that speed things up. Otherwise just grinding round after round is a real slog, which is what Real Radec discovered. “I’ve been doing this shit for an hour and only went from Level 44 to 45,” they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1831054519167529019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1831054519167529019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> in a follow-up. “I am NOT getting this Platinum bro.”</p><p>The Platinum trophy currently has a rating of “ultra rare” on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSN Profiles</a></span>, suggesting that less than .1 percent of <em>Concord </em>players tracked have unlocked it. Considering how low the hero shooter’s play count appears to have been to begin with, with some estimates <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">placing it around 25,000 players or less</a></span>, that’s a rarified group to be in, and we know how much PS5 fans love their exclusivity. </p><p>I’m mostly bummed because I was enjoying chasing the<em> Concord </em>Platinum at my own pace, with the game growing on me the more I progressed. I figured it would become a testament to a dead game at some point, but not this fast. And unfortunately, unlike some other players, I don’t have 48 hours to spend holding back on the analog stick. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello Games has just revealed what’s coming next to No Man’s Sky – <strong>fishing</strong>. In the Aquarius update, users will see a plethora of changes following on from the new water ecosystem introduced in Worlds Part I in July. Today, you can install this update and take advantage of new fishing mechanics, as well as deep-sea diving, boat-based exploration, new recipes, quests, and much more.</p>



<p>It’s another super-sized No Man’s Sky update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keep-on-delivering">Keep On Delivering</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">next free update in No Man’s Sky</a> has been revealed as ‘Aquarius’, and those with a passion for water-based activities will be enamoured by it. Instead of digging through the vast expanse of an infinite universe, you can now land on a planet, get your rod out, and start fishing, either alone or with friends.</p>



<p>Hello Games has added a wealth of marine creatures to the game, as well as new recipes and fresh ways to explore the gargantuan world. Users can now build and deploy an ‘Exo-Skiff’, a platform that floats over water and has on-board storage.</p>



<p>It has much more depth than just a bait-and-catch mechanic, though. Players can seek out fresh challenges and find long-lost secrets by reeling in relics and messages in bottles, which adds a little spice to the feature that some might think is mundane.</p>



<p>With the new ocean elements comes deep-sea exploration, and to succeed at that activity, players can now craft and upgrade diving equipment, allowing them to dig deeper into the trillions of planets in No Man’s Sky than ever before. And of course, No Man’s Sky: Aquarius, which is technically known as Patch 5.10, features stacks of upgrades, improvements, and quality-of-life tweaks.</p>



<p>It’s another stunning – and free – update from Hello Games.</p>

    <p><span>Name-changing update out now for PC.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em>Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles</em> has become <em><a title="Games > Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bulwark-evolution-falconeer-chronicles">Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles</a></em>, publisher <a title="Companies > Wired Productions [83 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/wired-productions">Wired Productions</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Tomas Sala [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tomas-sala">Tomas Sala</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/290100/view/4587567213536502598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. <span id="more-912488"></span></p><p>The name-changing update is available now for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,151 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> and is coming to consoles soon. Here is an overview of the new content, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p>Indie solo developer, Tomas Sala once again expands the horizons of “The Great Ursee.” and truly evolves it beyond the already unique and innovative city builder it was.</p><p>Following extensive feedback from players, Bulwark: Evolution now features three distinct ways to play with each mode providing a unique experience:</p><ul><li><strong>The Original <em>Bulwark</em> <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Players will explore the Great Ursee as they build their grand civilization, scavenge for resources, create trade routes, and form alliances with other factions scattered across the waves.</li><li><strong>Free Build Mode</strong> – Create without consequence in this cozy mode, free from the conflict and challenges of standard play, where players can experiment and build without limits.</li><li><strong>Total Conquest</strong> – The beacons are lit, and the fires of war are here! In this challenging new mode, players start <em>Bulwark</em> at war with every faction. There’s no diplomacy and the frequency and scale of raids is like nothing they’ve ever seen before. Building alone won’t suffice— players will need grit, determination, and strategic expertise to survive the onslaught of the Great Ursee.</li></ul><p>On top of this, the game has doubled its open-world content, added clearer progression, more strategic options and tons of new mechanics, including new fortresses for players to unlock, as well the ability to sail the high seas in their own ocean-going flagship as they into battle against enemies who are now are more capable and deadly than ever before.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>And here is a full breakdown of the update, via Tomas Sala:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Evolution</strong></p><p>You cannot get someone like me to run an Early Access campaign, I don’t even know at launch where the game is gonna end up in six months, it’d be a disaster.</p><p>And here we are five months after launch and I’m still working away as if every week is a new launch. The driver for this is community engagement. Folks coming in and fantasizing what the game could and should be, or sharing their frustration where the game doesn’t mix their expectations. This has been a learning experience for me. Ever since my days modding (<em>Moonpath to Elsweyr</em>), I’ve been looking at a way to get back to a more communal form of development. I don’t like premade systems and settled expectations, thus first the evolving demo and now Bulwark Evolution came about. My own way of creating a workable relationship with my audience and community, something modern, flexible and rapidly evolving, where updates come daily not monthly and communication is direct and without intermediates. Bulwark Evolution isn’t the endgame; for me, it marks what I consider as close to a 1.0 version as I can deliver, but it’s just another jumping-off point.</p><p>So yeah, I have learned a lot better to listen to what all of you were saying… And you have all said a lot! Plus, I’ve worked a lot to evolve the game, so lets keep doing that going forward!</p><p>Thank you all so much for providing feedback, leaving reviews, engaging on discord or here, it’s been a pleasure and if I stumbled or failed along the way, I apologize and hope all this work proves the best intent to be the best game developer I can be, albeit as experimental and unconventional as always.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>—Tomas Sala</p><p><strong>Total Conquest Mode</strong></p><ul><li>You start at war with the other factions except your starting faction and freehouse.</li><li>You gain one

            <p>
UK high street chain GAME has acknowledged customers awaiting pre-orders are currently facing "issues" accessing their accounts online, as they wait for delayed deliveries to arrive. 
</p>
<p>
GAME customers with items they had pre-ordered and already paid for told Eurogamer they had received no advance notice of any issue, and have been unable to check the status of their orders online. The issues follow Eurogamer's reporting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">GAME was ending in-store pre-orders</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The GAME website is currently undergoing upgrades, and as a result, we are aware that some customers are experiencing issues accessing their GAME accounts and order details," a spokesperson for parent company Frasers Group said. 
</p>
<p>
"We are working to have these resolved quickly and encourage customers to get in touch with our customer service team if they are experiencing issues. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused." 
</p>
<p>
However, one customer reported to Eurogamer they had contacted GAME's customer service only to be told there was no estimate for their item's delayed dispatch - and a refund could not be offered as order was "processing".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the current GAME website maintenance is another part of the chain's integration with Frasers Group systems, and follows the end of the GAME Wallet functionality last month - something Eurogamer originally reported on in July. 
</p>
<p>
At the time, Eurogamer also reported that GAME would be ending in-store pre-orders. This year has seen the chain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">end the ability to trade-in products and buy pre-owned games</a>, ceding that corner of the high street market to CEX. It has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">wound down its GAME Reward program</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-dropping-xbox-all-access-offering-later-this-month">halted support for Xbox All Access</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-stop-selling-physical-games-other-than-fulfilling-pre-orders-report">GAME denied a report online that claimed it would stop selling physical games outright</a>.

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, the studio says that four "essential" DLCs for the game will be bundled into the base game starting from October 17th. All current and future players will receive these DLCs for free, and you "won't even need to do anything to receive them".</p>
<p>Three of the DLCs in question were originally part of the game's Starter Edition, and the fourth has been added to "enrich the core experience of&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>even more".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-universalis-iv-free-dlc-map.jpg?itok=9h230ZNF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-universalis-iv-free-dlc-map.jpg?itok=GDjuC6bJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>player, some free goodies could be heading your way.</figcaption></figure><p>The four DLCs you'll be able to get for free are as follows.</p>

</ul><p>These DLCs add features like new religious gameplay elements, new leader personality traits, and new models and pictures for certain units and faiths, plus lots more.</p>
<p>If you already happen to own these DLCs, Paradox says it'll be introducing a brand new Starter Edition of&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>when this initiative begins, and also that the price of the Ultimate Bundle will be lowered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you'll get any kind of freebie or extra goodies if you do already own these DLCs, but if you don't, then this feels like a pretty great opportunity to get back into&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV</em>.</p>

You'll watch your nation grow and change from just before the Renaissance up to the Age of Revolutions.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a Paradox game, you'll have minute control over everything from trade strategy through to diplomacy and warfare, so how your nation evolves really is up to you.</p>
<p><em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>. Just make sure you don't buy any of the four DLCs listed above before October 17th, eh?</p>

<p>A Minecraft Movie has just received a teaser and a 2025 release window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie is an upcoming live-action adaptation by Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary P, and Jared Hess directs it. The cast features Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge. Check out the latest teaser below.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The movie’s teaser takes us to a Minecraft-themed world with hyper-realistic visuals. Everything is square, as it should be; however, the level of texture on the blocks is very close to reality. Fans get to see how the flora and fauna of this world will appear as the cast takes on various kinds of deadly mobs like Piglins and Zombies. The teaser also showcases the iconic crafting table in action and how you can build anything you can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-s-plot">A Minecraft Movie’s Plot</h2>



<p>The teaser’s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">description</a> gives players an idea of A Minecraft Movie’s plot. It seems that the cast will find themselves struggling in the real world before they are suddenly warped to a “cubic wonderland” through a mysterious portal. To return home, the characters will have to master this world and also protect it from evil as they set foot on a quest given to them by expert crafter Steve. Also, Jack Black will not be turning into a block to play the role.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The next free update for No Man's Sky has arrived, and it introduces a feature that developer Hello Games has wanted to bring to the game for a long time: fishing.</p><p>The Aquarius update, which arrives alongside the 5.10 patch, adds fishing as a core new feature. "Players can now explore the universe to find their perfect waterside spot, hopping with fish. Sit and relax alone with your thoughts, or stand alongside fellow Travellers as you look out over alien vistas waiting for a bite," reads a line from the expansion's description.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Man's Sky - Aquarius Update Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Players are now able to add a fishing rig to the multi-tool that allows them to fish in bodies of water. There are more than 160 varieties of fish in the game, spread throughout the game's many planets. Certain types of fish only appear at set times of day and during specific weather conditions. Players can fish from shore or trek out into the water in an Exo-Skiff to fish for critters in deeper waters.</p><p>Players can use normal bait to catch standard fish or craft special bait to attract rare fish, including "legendary" fish types. Players may also hook onto messages in a bottle that contain information about players who have fished in certain spots before.</p><p>The fish that players catch can be cooked and eaten, and the Aquarius update introduces a variety of new recipes to choose from. Additionally, the game's Wonders Catalogue now contains a section dedicated to fishing achievements, detailing things like fish types caught, their weight, and how to catch specific types of fish.</p><p>The Aquarius update also allows players to deploy autonomous floating fish farms to collect fish while they're off-world doing other things. There is a new event called the Aquarius expedition, which begins today, September 4, and challenges players to catch fish from across the galaxy over a period of six weeks. Players who complete the expedition will unlock special customization parts for their boat, along with an underwater jetpack and a nice fishing rod called the Lost Angler.</p><p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">read the full blog post</a> on the Aquarius update to get all the essential information about what's new for fishing and more in this update. The full patch notes follow below.</p><h2><strong>No Man's Sky 5.10 patch notes</strong></h2><ul><li>Players can now install a Fishing Rig in their Multi-Tool, enabling them to cast their line into any body of water and begin fishing. Purchase Fishing Rig blueprints aboard the Space Anomaly.</li><li>Over 160 varieties of fish are available to catch. Finding each fish will require exploration of different planets, fishing at different times of day and during different weather conditions, and trawling across a wide range of depths.</li><li>Your catch history, including weight records, is recorded in the new Fishing section of the Wonders catalogue.</li></ul><ul><li>Craft specialist bait and apply it to your Fishing Rig to lure in specific fish.</li><li>In addition, any edible item can be deployed as bait. Experiment with different cooked products to find the most effective bait for your fishing feeds.</li><li>A large range of new seafood recipes have been added for the Nutrient Processor.</li><li>Those who do not wish to consume or sell their catch may release their fish back into the water.</li></ul><ul><li>Occasionally, inanimate objects may be retrieved from the water instead of fish. Such objects include procedurally generated messages in bottles and water-damaged technology upgrades.</li></ul><ul><li>Automated Traps are available to research in the Space Anomaly. These self-sustaining units are an alternative to manual angling, and will attract fish as appropriate for the water conditions in which they are placed.</li></ul><ul><li>The Exo-Skiff is a new piece of deployable technology, summoned from the Quick Menu after its interface is installed in the Exosuit. Research the appropriate blueprints aboard the Space Anomaly.</li><li>The Exo-Skiff hovers just above the surface of the water and reacts to wave movement to create the perfect deep-sea fishing platform for those looking for deep-water fish.</li><li>The skiff comes with a dedicated Cold Storage inventory, allowing players to conveniently store their catches.</li><li>The Exo-Skiff can be recoloured via its own internal customisation interface.</li></ul><ul><li>Fishing is fully compatible with first and third person play, and has unique casting mechanics for VR players.</li><li>New music tracks have been added to accompany the fishing experience.</li></ul><ul><li>Expedition Fifteen, Aquarius, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li><li>Rewards include new posters, decals and titles; a deep-sea diving suit customisation set; the unique Lost Angler’s Rig fishing rod; and the exclusive Aquarius Flightpack.</li></ul><ul><li>Water reflections are now enabled for PSVR2.</li><li>PCVR now supports reflections on the water while running with reflections set to Ultra.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could make it difficult to interact with some space station objects while in VR.</li></ul><ul><li>The jetpack effects used while underwater have been improved.</li><li>Fixed a number of rendering artefacts related to water.</li><li>Fixed a number of issues that could allow ships to spawn with the wrong landing-gear state.</li><li>Fixed a visual issue with icons when switching pages in the Catalogue.</li><li>Fixed a minor visual issue with the Liquidator mech.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a rare issue that could cause items to be transferred to a deprecated inventory when Quick Transferring to a full Exosuit inventory.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause mineable objects to incorrectly display a STEEL label.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the Left / Right Handedness option from being immediately applied to the third person camera.</li><li>Allowed the Multi-Tool to remain unholstered when in Photo Mode in a multiplayer game.</li><li>Removed the deprecated Shutter Door base part from the Catalogue.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a number of water rendering issues with some specific base parts.</li><li>Fixed a number of water-smearing issues when playing in VR.</li><li>Fixed an Xbox-specific texture rendering issue.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause black speckling in depth-of-field effects while playing with screen-space shadows enabled.</li><li>Fixed a rendering corruption issue with starship cockpit screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause graininess on PS4.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause ship juddering during warp.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a crash related to dialogue interactions.</li><li>Fixed a PS4-specific memory crash.</li><li>Fixed a PS5-specific crash related to shader loading.</li><li>Fixed a crash related to explosion effects.</li><li>Fixed a number of issues related to the loading of freighters and frigates.</li><li>The messaging around some Vulkan-based GPU compatibility issues has been improved.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a stall/hitch when switching between inventory pages.</li><li>Introduced a number of optimisations while accessing the inventory.</li><li>Introduced a minor planetary rendering optimisation.</li></ul>

            <p>If you, like me, have been wondering just how Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures were going to approach a live-action Minecraft movie, I have good news for you. We now have our first good look at the upcoming adaptation, known simply as A Minecraft Movie, thanks to a new trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer, which you can see below, introduces us to Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-minecraft-movie-images-leak-days-after-tenacious-d-controversy">Jack Black's Steve</a>. There are also some cuboid sheep and Piglins marching around the place, because Minecraft.</p>
<p>In addition to Momoa and Black, the upcoming film also stars Wednesday's Emma Myers, Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Stifler's mum. I mean, Jennifer Coolidge, who has also starred in the likes of The White Lotus and the Legally Blonde films. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival," reads the official blurb. "Four misfits - Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks) - find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.</p>
<p>"To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black).  Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is currently set to make its debut in theatres next year, on 4th April.</p>

<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It only took them 38 years, but Zelda is finally getting to be the star of her own legend. Sure, she’s had cameos as a badass in a bunch of the games that she lends her name to, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the first time that she is the leading protagonist. It’s also the first time that hitting things with a sword or boomerang won’t be your first instinct when playing, and the blend of creative puzzle-solving at the heart of this game is a thoroughly refreshing change of pace.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preview – Zelda's awakening to a new style adventure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXW9sbboA9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hyrule is once again thrown into complete chaos as a malevolent force reveals itself, dark and star-filled rifts spreading across the land, consuming the landscape, buildings and villages, and the people of the world. Some are even replaced by shadowy doppelgängers, including Zelda’s father, the king, who goes on to sentence her to death!</p>


<p>Surely some of the castle’s guards would have objected to such a dramatic change of tone, you’d have thought, but our hands on time with Echoes of Wisdom starts with Zelda locked up in a prison cell with only a mysterious new sprite named Tri for company. Gifting Zelda the Tri Rod, we’re quickly introduced to one of the most fundamental new ideas in the game: echoes.</p>
<p>The Tri Rod allows Zelda to copy and then recall all manner of objects that she comes across on her adventures, from tables and crates, to rocks, pots, trees, signs, trampolines, and even beds, if she needs a quick restorative nap! Right from the off, they lend a huge amount of playfulness to the puzzle-solving in the world, whether it’s creating steps to get up to a ledge, summoning pots to throw as a sound distraction (or to hop and hide in), layering trees and beds to make walkways, and so much more. It’s such a simple delight to use this ability as you’re getting around, and in a similar vein to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, Nintendo really leans into enabling player creativity when applying logic to overcome different scenarios –&nbsp;do you drop a heavy block to smash boxes, or set them on fire?</p>

<p>The only real limitation being that Tri can only provide so many pips of summoning power, with the oldest echo disappearing if you summon something new – you can, of course, manually dispel the most recent echo or all of them together.</p>

<p>But how does Zelda actually fight the army of beasties now roaming across Hyrule? Does she bop them on the bonce with the wand? Far from it. Hers is a more… intellectual approach, shall we say. Yes, you can pick up rocks and items and throw them at enemies, and she does have a grass-clearing spin move, though this might only gently stun an enemy. Once you’ve managed to defeat something for the first time, though, she can absorb it into the Tri Rod and make it as summonable as an overly keen waiter.</p>
<p>Summoning enemies makes combat more like the puzzling and traversal that makes up much of the rest of the game. Moblins can be summoned to chuck spears and Darknuts to wade in and swing axes, while Sea Urchins can be a handy spike barrier, and the Candle Zol is just the kind of summon that will get you to unleash your inner arsonist.</p>
<p>Where things start to get really special is with Tri’s ability to Bind to objects and creatures. This can work in two ways, to either have the bound item move with you, or to lock Zelda to follow the movement of the item. It’s powerful enough to shift huge blocks, flexible enough to reach through bars and pick up statues, or to attach to moving platforms above Zelda’s head, but it also enables a whole host of borderline game-breaking ideas.</p>

<p>Bind to a summoned spider, and that spider and crawl up and over trees, getting you to otherwise inaccessible places. in combat, you can summon and hold a fighter at arm’s length, whether making an Urchin in to spiky shield you bash enemies with, or that Candle Zol to set everything on fire. Again.</p>
<p>It’s all brought together within the dungeons, as is the case with so may classic Zelda games, but in Echoes of Wisdom, these dungeons might have been gobbled up by the rift as well. Tri can open a little gateway into the rifts, revealing to you the Still World with frozen chunks of land suspended in the cosmos. There’s some light platforming to be done here, hopping between islands and across impromptu bridges made of trees, and combined with summoning echoes. Reaching the first dungeon sees a fairly traditional style with room puzzles and using abilities to depress switches, defeat enemies and the like.</p>
<p>A fresh trick found here is the Swordfighter form that effectively turns Zelda into a glowing blue Link with sword and shield. You’ve only got a little time before her energy gauge drains and she reverts to normal though, and topping it up needs you to collect nuggets of blue energy from within the Still World, so you need to use it wisely.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most obvious options when facing off against the first boss, a rock creature that might make you wonder if Nintendo has something against Knack, but since the Swordfighter form can only be used sparingly, it’s a fight that’s about putting echoes and binding to use to hit a weak spot and then attack heavily during a damage phase. As straightforward as that might sound, there’s plenty of different ways to go about it and lots of different summons that can be useful.</p>

<p>All of this is rendered in the wonderful style of the Link’s Awakening remake from a few years ago. It’s a chunky, cartoony world with depth of field liberally used to give a dreamy tilt shift effect, and it’s just lovely in so many ways. However, just as Link’s Awakening had some frame rate struggles and hiccups, I fear that the added burden of spawning items on the fly and having the potential consequences of that –&nbsp;lots of fire, for example –&nbsp;does seem to leave this game with a stuttery frame rate as well. Hopefully the final release code is a touch more stable in that regard.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a wonderful surprise for the tail-end of the Switch generation, a game that’s full of charm, enables player creativity, and is generally just a quirky, playful delight.</p>

			<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension, in some ways, is the closing of a circle that began back in 1986 with the release of the original Final Fantasy. After leaving Square back in 2003 following the launch of the tenth entry in the series that changed JRPGs forever, Hironobu Sakaguchi founded Mistwalker, releasing multiple solid titles over the years, including Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, created in collaboration with Dragon Ball's Akira Toriyama and Slam Dunk and Vagabond's Takehiko Inoue respectively. The latest game from the studio is FANTASIAN, which was launched a while back for the Apple Arcade service and is now about to hit PC and consoles thanks to the company the creator of Final Fantasy left over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to try out FANTASIAN Neo Dimension on Nintendo Switch, playing through a sequence early in the story that allowed me to experience some of the game's unique mechanics. Even on the little screen of the Nintendo console, it was easy to appreciate the game's unique visuals, which blend 3D character models and hand-crafted dioramas. These visuals are far from being cutting-edge, but they give the adventure a very peculiar feel and a strong visual identity that is hard to forget.</p>
<p>While exploring the small forest the Gamescom demo was set in together with the main character Leo and his companions, who are on a journey to recover the hero's memories and solve the mystery of the mechanical infection that is destroying the world, I was able to test the FANTASIAN Neo Dimension combat mechanics, whose twists give an edge to some traditional game systems. The game's combat system is a straightforward turn-based system, with a turn bar informing players of the turn order, where characters and enemies can use a variety of different attacks and skills, all coming with elemental properties that can deal more damage if a weakness is hit. What sets this simple combat system apart is the skill system itself, which allows players to alter the trajectory of certain skills to hit multiple enemies. This is a mechanic that I'm sure will be used a lot in the full game, as battles against multiple enemies can take a while, especially when using single-target skills.</p>

<p>Thankfully, random battles are never a problem with FANTASIAN Neo Dimension, thanks to the twist to one of the oldest JRPG mechanics introduced by the Dimengeon System. By employing this system, it is possible to send encountered enemies to a dimensional dungeon, and skip the battle altogether. At some point, however, Leo and his companions will have to fight the enemies sent to this dungeon, otherwise the Dimengeon Machine will overflow and force them into a longer battle. To make these battles more manageable, however, players can attack Dimengeon Gimmicks, which grant some welcome buffs, widening the array of available strategic choices to make combat even more engaging.</p>
<p>While 30 minutes or so are too little to provide a proper evaluation of FANTASIAN Neo Dimension as a JRPG due to the little story covered, it is undeniable that the Final Fantasy series DNA is very prominent in the game. As such, it won't have any trouble finding an audience when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch sometime this Winter.</p>

			<p>Today, Hello Games is releasing a new No Man's Sky update titled <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquarius</a>. As you can easily surmise, it is centered around water and more specifically it adds the long-requested fishing to the game. Sean Murray said in a press release that fans really loved the new water technology added in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-update-part-i-refreshes-the-universes-flora-fauna-weather-and-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Part I update</a> a few weeks ago, inspiring the studio to add fishing next.</p>
<p>Players can now explore the universe to find their perfect spot on the water bouncing with fish, sitting alone and relaxing with their thoughts, or with fellow travelers looking out over alien vistas waiting for a bite. Featuring a vast array of fish, from common minnows to wild alien catches, each with its own habitat and fishing conditions. Bait your line to lure the rarest fish, or search the deep for hidden messages in a bottle. There are trophies to earn, fishing logs to complete, and new fishing gear to unlock. There's even a unique fishing expedition that sends No Man's Sky players on a quest for the biggest catch of the day.</p>

<p>Some new equipment introduced in the Aquarius update allows players to fish in deep water with ease from their personal fishing platform. New fishing pots can also be used to bait and trap rare catches. Cook up the day's catch with new recipe combinations waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Aquarius Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zu-OxnMETY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Murray also said that the previous Worlds Part I update resulted in No Man's Sky's largest player base numbers in over five years. As such, Hello Games still has many plans to improve the game further, even now that it is over eight years old (it launched with many controversies back in August 106), and even despite its work-in-progress development of the fantasy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a> (which still has no release date).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creativity.971712/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finally, close to 40 years after the first game we are getting a mainline<em> The Legend of Zelda </em>game that features Zelda as the protagonist. After having a little over an hour with the game, anyone who has loved the simple mechanics that have given players so much amazing creative freedom, like in Tears of the Kingdom, should be scrambling to get their hands on <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rifts opened up over a Hyrule with people, buildings, monsters, and more falling into the abyss. Started by some magical event Zelda is implicated in, she is blamed and sent to jail. That’s where we see the game begin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While in her cell, a new magical friend named Tri shows up to lend Zelda a hand. Tri has a mutual need to see the rifts closed and people rescued as their friends are trapped because of them as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tri offers Zelda their power, which comes in the form of the Tri Rod. This gives Zelda some really amazing abilities that are both simple to understand yet endless in their possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Echoes Are Simple Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>The main use of the Tri-Rod is the collection and use of Echoes. Echoes are when Zelda absorbs or learns the essence of an object or enemy to then be able to make a copy of them herself later.</p>
<p>For example, the first thing you’ll get access to is a short table. At a touch of a button it is added to your catalogue and Zelda can start producing tables wherever there is space for one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objects get more elaborate, from the classic pots we all love to smash in a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game, to trees, and a whole lot more. Each has their own properties, like being made of wood or stone for example, and uses.</p>

<p>That table, for example, is just one unit high and Zelda can jump on it. A crate is two high, meaning you need the table to jump on. Quickly put it together and you’ve got stairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond objects, Zelda can use echoes of defeated enemies, which is useful as she has no offensive abilities of her own. Take down a keese (the bat) and you can then get a flock (cloud when its bats apparently) to send after enemies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The one caveat is that it’s not endless. Tri does not have limitless power, though it can be leveled up. To start, Tri just has three triangles of power that can be used to produce echoes, each of which cost a certain number of triangles.</p>
<h2>Echoes Encourage Creativity and Curiosity</h2>
<p>Not all enemy echoes are for simply combat, either. One very useful enemy is a spider that you can then use to make a quick rope of webs to climb up and get around places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can pick up smaller echoes as well, holding onto them, and they work logically like you would think. Holding onto a keese? Well, jump from a great height and glide to safety thanks to their handy wings.</p>
<p>Echoes keep their properties as well, not just the shape. Wood still catches fire, a trampoline will bounce, and the bed you make can be rested in to restore hearts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a way, this use of Echoes is an expansion on Cappy’s mechanics from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. While not directly taking control of enemies or objects here, you’re still interacting with them in a similar way and they are full of surprising effects that will have you say, “I can’t believe they thought of that.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just like when <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> showed off its gameplay briefly before release, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> delighted me in the wonderful conduits of our imagination we’ll all have at our fingertips soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a playfulness, an encouragement to try new things and mix them together see how things work with one another for just the hell of it in <em>Echoes of the Wisdom </em>that feels the exact same as <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That same feeling of wanting to attach every item you find to an arrow to see what it did in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is here in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. How will the various Echoes interact with one another? What other creative ways can I get through this puzzle?</p>
<p>I can see the social media posts of the crazy solves of dungeon puzzles just as we have seen with the shrines in both <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>Making quick logical leaps in Echoes to drop some pots on the head of an enemy as I stood on a ledge above was just as satisfying as being able to pick up a spear goblin and use it as a mobile turret as it kept hurling spears at enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no loss, no penalty for experimentation, making it all the easier to just try whatever springs to mind. The best part is, Echoes usually has a reward down any path your willing to go down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, what my first logical leap to solve a puzzle is likely very different from someone else but both can be the right answer. There were a few moments in my preview that the Nintendo representative with me said they hadn't though of, even though they were able to complete it as well.</p>
<h2>Ultrahand is in Echoes of Wisdom</h2>
<p>With all that in mind, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>isn’t done with the simple yet deep mechanics. The Tri Rod also gives Zelda the ability to grab objects and enemies from afar, similar to the Ultrahand ability in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Echoes, the objects or enemies will stay the same distance from you as they were when you grabbed them. You can’t manipulate or spin them around like Ultrahand, though that doesn’t harm its usefulness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, this ability features greatly in puzzles, whether that is moving a distant object onto a button to open a door or to put it in place to complete a walkway to let you progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, grabbing Echoes and other objects is extremely useful in combat and elsewhere in the world as well. Maybe a quick shield is useful, so grabbing a crate to take a hit or two and carrying it close can be useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A likely future go-to is taking a sea urchin and using it as a shield and weapon. Hold it close to run its spikes into enemies for damage and let it take the hit for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of things in the environment and potential hazards you can set up to use on enemies. Maybe there’s a pit nearby you can grab enemies and toss them down or a sea urchin or two you can ram them into. Enemy with a shield? Grab and take it away.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> isn’t done there, as that grabbing ability has a secondary affect as well. You can grab an object, or enemy, and link yourself together then essentially attach Zelda to its movements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A platform above moving left and right can then be used to cross a gap that was otherwise unreachable. Maybe a flying creature has a path that takes it over a ledge with no other obvious route to it. Floating in air below, Zelda can attach herself to that creature and hitch a ride.</p>
<p>Once its mechanics became more natural, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> just makes sense and changes your approach to gameplay. The logic of the game is intuitive, meaning the only real limitation is realizing just how much you have at your disposal in any given moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To compare it to Tears of the Kingdom again, Echoes of Wisdom has similar “a-ha” moments in what you can do. Delights at your creations are around every corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This era of Nintendo is defined by having mechanics you can explain in a sentence but would need hours or days to show all that they can do. The Echoes in Echoes of Wisdom are simple brilliance just as Cappy in Odyssey and Fuse in Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>More than anything, the most exciting element of Echoes of Wisdom is how much it encouraged player creativity, how much it wants you to just try things out. It's simple brilliance done wonderfully.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> releases for Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-harvest-shadows-advice<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie dev David Wehle, who's behind the Gamescom horror farming hit&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows</em>, has admitted that he's "pretty much out of money", and he wants to know what the community thinks he should do next.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1559720/view/4584188879511589238" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>Steam page, Wehle says that the&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>demo has been praised extensively, including by none other than Remedy's Sam Lake. Despite that, Wehle is "out of money", and&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>still "needs 1+ year of work at least".</p>
<p>Wehle says he "kinda abhor[s] publishers" because of what he calls their "insanely greedy terms and requirements", and so he's considering liquidating his retirement account in order to self-publish&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows</em>. Doing so would, however, make the game a smaller "$15 game" experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-harvest-shadows-indie-dev-no-money-doll.jpg?itok=eS1rn613 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-harvest-shadows-indie-dev-no-money-doll.jpg?itok=fdRyhBPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a spot of trouble, and it needs your advice.</figcaption></figure><p>If Wehle takes this route, he says the game will become "a longer version of the demo but with a few more items, a vehicle, places to explore, story, etc...".</p>
<p>The other option, Wehle says, is to seek out a publisher and use their resources to improve the game's quality and scope. He says this would make&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>"truly feel like a $20 experience".</p>
<p>Wehle says he's currently "at a crossroads"; he doesn't want to give into publishers who didn't support him "a year ago when [he] showed it to them", but he does want&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>to be good.</p>
<p>As such, Wehle wants your feedback. He says that if you've got some thoughts about what he should do, you should leave them as a comment on the Steam post, and he'll "definitely read it and ponder your feedback".</p>

<p>At time of writing, it seems like most of Wehle's audience <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1559720/eventcomments/4756451924772751145?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doesn't want him to use his retirement fund</a>. Some are suggesting Kickstarter or Patreon, while others are recommending finding a publisher or simply scaling back the experience.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>We Harvest Shadows&nbsp;</em>is, Wehle describes it as a "first-person farming horror allegory" in which you must "become a recluse, build up your farm, and survive the lonely nights".

And by that, I mean Warner Bros. just released the first teaser trailer for <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. The film features actual humans and a slightly realistic CG take on <em>Minecraft</em>. But when you mix the game’s iconic blocky style with real life, you get, well, this:</p><div><p><cite>Image: Warner Bros. Pictures</cite></p></div><p>Unsettling imagery aside, <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> looks like some silly family fun, with lots of one-liners, large-scale battles, and Jack Black exclaiming “I am Steve!” very proudly. And obviously, there’s both mining and crafting. Aside from Black, the movie also stars Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge. It’s directed by Jared Hess of <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em> fame and is hitting theaters in North America on April 4th.</p><div><p>Of course, we now live in a time when video game adaptations are no longer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">expected to be bad</a>, so <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> will be released into a world with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves">the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> trilogy</a> as competition. (The less said about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232389/borderlands-movie-review-interview-video-on-demand"><em>Borderlands</em></a>, the better.) It’s also not the only <em>Minecraft</em> adaptation in the works; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24167317/netflix-minecraft-animated-series-microsoft-mojang">Netflix is working on an animated series as well</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232567/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Every <em>Legend of Zelda </em>game has had its quirky innovations, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary"><em>Breath of the Wild </em>revolutionized the franchise</a> in ways that felt monumental and reflective of Nintendo being ready to try something — a number of things, really — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14262222/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-preview-hands-on-tokyo">new with Link</a>. <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s openness made its take on Hyrule feel unlike anything we’d ever seen from the series, and its story brought Link to life by building a big, rich world around him that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14717578/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-preview">you were meant to spend hours exploring</a>.</p><p><em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s innovative gameplay mechanics worked so well that it wasn’t shocking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024">see them return</a> in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, which was more of a direct sequel than an entirely new legend. But it’s rather surprising how strongly you can see the influence of those games in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, Nintendo’s newest mainline <em>Zelda </em>entry — the first to let you play as the princess herself. During the time I recently spent hands-on with the game, almost everything about <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>made it feel like a crystallization of the <em>Zelda </em>franchise’s recent era of experimentation. And while it’s a little hard to imagine at first how a <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-esque openness could lend itself to a more traditional, top-down <em>Zelda </em>game, Nintendo seems to have found a way to make it work beautifully.</p><p>After years of waiting on the sidelines while Link hacked and slashed his way through Hyrule, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>turns Princess Zelda into the hero as she sets out to stop Ganon. When we first meet this Zelda, it’s clear that she isn’t a stranger to the dangers Ganon poses and the important role Link typically plays in the grand battle between light and dark. But with Link and many other Hylians swallowed up by one of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s strange portals, Zelda’s left to her own devices to keep her kingdom from plunging into total chaos.</p><p>Lots of things about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> — like its assortment of monsters and focus on puzzle-centric dungeon crawling — make it feel like a classic <em>Zelda </em>game at first blush.&nbsp;But one of the most novel things about the new title is how much of a Zelda (the character) game it feels like compared to its predecessors outside of the fact that you can finally play as the princess. Zelda is a very different person than her trusted knight. He’s a warrior who runs around yelling and spinning at his enemies, but she’s a thinker who knows that her wits can be sharper than a blade. <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>tries to make you feel that difference as soon as you’re given the game’s new signature key item, the Tri Rod.</p><p>By waving the Tri Rod at certain objects and defeated monsters, Zelda and her companion Tri can create duplicates of them called echoes. Early into my demo, the echoes I learned were of ordinary things you’d find in any top-down <em>Zelda,</em> like a small table and a bed. But rather than simply existing as visual detail, the echoes give you a variety of ways to tackle <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s various puzzles. A single table doesn’t seem like much at first, but a stack of them is perfect for getting Zelda up high enough to sneak out of a prison cell. And in moments when Zelda might need to hide, being able to conjure a large pot she can climb into is very handy.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the puzzles I played through were relatively simple, there were a handful of ways they could have been solved by using different echoes. One approach might make other onscreen characters behave in a certain way that opened up a previously blocked path, and another method could give me an entirely different route to take by creating walkways. Some of that variability comes from the way that echoes interact with their environments by default — one monster, for example, immediately started hopping around and setting things on fire after I called it out. But much of it boils down to the way <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>encourages you to experiment.</p><p>The number of echoes you can create at any given time is determined by the number of triangles floating behind Tri and a point system that assigns different costs to things you can create. While a table echo costs a single triangle, a Moblin echo requires two. The game will automatically delete old echoes in the order you created them as you make new ones, so it requires you to put some thought into what you’re doing as battles become more complicated.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a ball summoning a swarm of Keese to sic on Moblins once I was able to get out into the open world, but it wasn’t long before I realized that brute force isn’t the easiest way to play&nbsp;when you start out. With just a few heart containers, it doesn’t take much to knock Zelda out, meaning that you have to be somewhat strategic in how to deploy echoes to fight for you while also taking care to avoid incoming attacks. And because your echoes sustain damage as well, you often have to be ready to conjure new ones at just the right time in order to take out difficult enemies. But the princess does have some other options at her disposal.</p><p>Because echoes are such a huge part of the game, it was surprising to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">Zelda pick up Link’s sword</a> and gain the ability to fight (and dress) the way he does. In her swordfighter form, Zelda’s more nimble and able to block attacks using a magically manifested shield. But Zelda’s transformations are temporary and tied to a magic meter that quickly depletes if you leave it running for too long. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s first boss battles did an impressive job of teaching me that as powerful as Zelda’s swordfighter form is, it’s not something you can just default to — at least not when you first start playing the game. The sword is important, but it’s just one of many tools you’re supposed to use strategically as the game pushes you to think about the multiple ways its challenges can be overcome.</p><p>Based just on the small chunk of <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>I was able to get through, it feels like Nintendo’s supercharged the classic top-down <em>Zelda </em>formula by infusing it with many of the franchise’s cleverest innovations. It’s not exactly an open world or classic <em>Zelda</em>, but it’s something new — and it’s a perfect fit for the princess.</p><p><small>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom <em>launches on the Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
