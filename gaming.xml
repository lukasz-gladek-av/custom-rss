			<p>The new integrated mod manager for Baldur's Gate 3 has been highly successful, with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/">5.4 million downloads</a> in just four days.&nbsp;<span>Using the unlocked version of the official modding tool released by Larian Studios, a modder has created new areas for players to explore. The user has been posting screenshots on Reddit under the name <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/katszenBurger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">katzenBurger</a>, where they post areas such as a castle on the shore and</span>&nbsp;Avernus.</p>
<p>Avernus is an area that is mentioned a huge amount throughout the game for different characters' storylines, and it was an area that players were desperate to see in-game. Avernus is the first layer of hell in the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse, but unfortunately won't ever be seen officially in Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>This isn't a surprise to many fans, as Larian Studios confirmed a while ago that they are not working on any expansions for Baldur's Gate 3 or any follow-up game. As a result, the modding tool has been implemented to give players a new playground to have fun. The modding tool was added on September 9. Still, players have found a way to use an 'unlocked' version of the modding tool created by Larian Studios, which is exactly what is allowing katzenBurger to create new maps and locations for the game.</p>
<p>A video of the castle area and Avernus has been uploaded to YouTube, showcasing some of the area and detailing it. According to KatzenBurger, using the mod tool to make maps is incredibly easy, as it opens it up to other players trying to create their maps, too.</p>
<p><iframe title="baldurs gate 3 toolkit unlocked map test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Console players will now be able to enjoy the mods that are made using the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit exclusively. Still, for those made using the "unlocked" tool, it means that the console players won't be able to access them unless Larian decides to unlock the toolkit fully. However, it's unlikely that will be happening, as CEO Swen Vincke said in March that wouldn't be happening. Still, depending on how successful these mods are once they are full released, it could be a game changer for Larian Studios.</p>
<p>The toolkit was released as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was claimed to be the final update for the game. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-gets-more-details-ahead-of-its-september-launch-wont-be-the-final-update/">Larian Studios has confirmed that it isn't the final update</a>&nbsp;but doesn't want to talk about what is yet to come in future updates. However, the most recent update provided a lot of new variations, adding new Legendary Actions, 13 new cinematics for your evil playthrough, and Honor Mode improvements.</p>

You’ll encounter four you can work with: Pyke Syndicate, Ashiga Clan, Crimson Dawn, and Hutt Cartel. They all offer different jobs and unique rewards, and some of them affect the main story of the game. But you can’t make all of them happy. Someone’s bound to get hurt in the crossfire!</p><p>Here’s an in-depth look at the game’s main factions, their rewards, which you should side with early on, and more!</p><h2 id="h100685"><a id=""></a><strong>The factions of Star Wars Outlaws</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9f6214da0d616a88d1faf8fadb9b2b90" data-recommend-id="image://9f6214da0d616a88d1faf8fadb9b2b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Welcome to the Underworld information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Welcome to the Underworld information screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f6214da0d616a88d1faf8fadb9b2b90" data-recommend-id="image://9f6214da0d616a88d1faf8fadb9b2b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Welcome to the Underworld information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned,<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> features four crime syndicates for Kay Vess to partner with: Pyke Syndicate, Crimson Dawn, Hutt Cartel, and Ashiga Clan.

Opportunities will arise during quests that force you to choose between two opposing organizations, and in doing so, the mission outcome varies along with its rewards. Some do prove better than others!<br></p><p>It’s also worth knowing that your reputation with any given faction will hugely change your day-to-day experience while playing, where entering their territory (whether on a planet or in space) might see you cautiously welcomed, or immediately fired upon.</p><p>Click next to start learning about all the game’s criminal syndicates.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-recommend-id="image://50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Criminal Network screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Criminal Network screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-recommend-id="image://50d54082ea9b836efaf0387d3686d859" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Criminal Network screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Pyke Syndicate is this system’s most significant criminal enterprise, controlling territories on Toshara, Mirogana, Akiva, and Myrra.

An enormous version of the Stardew Valley title screen was built from LEGO and placed behind the model too.</p><p>Creator Steve Jensen told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/this-incredible-stardew-valley-lego-build-won-an-award-and-got-a-surprise-visit-from-concernedape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> the build took around two years to complete, and his favorite elements include the Hat Shop, "because I was able to make [it] almost entirely hollow, so you can look through the cracks and broken parts and see through to more such openings on the other side, just as a rundown, abandoned structure would be," Jensen said.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@beyondthebrick/video/7412313844158188830" data-video-id="7412313844158188830"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beyondthebrick?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@beyondthebrick" rel="noopener noreferrer">@beyondthebrick</a> Huge LEGO Stardew Valley by Steve Jensen <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lego?refer=embed" title="lego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#lego</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/stardewvalley?refer=embed" title="stardewvalley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stardewvalley</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7412313818623986462?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Beyond the Brick" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Beyond the Brick</a> </section> </blockquote> <p>"Another fave is the Wizard's Tower. I was able to get the shape I wanted, including a peaked door, and vines growing up the sides, the cone-shaped roof in blue, everything."</p><p>The effort certainly impressed the LEGO community as the Stardew Valley build earned the People's Choice award at BrickCon, and it even attracted the game's creator. Eric Barone, the one man developer behind ConcernedApe, turned up to admire the recreation of his own work, something Jensen said was "even bigger news than an award."</p><p>Stardew Valley is a beloved farming simulator blended with role-playing game elements that was dubbed a masterpiece in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">IGN's updated 10/10 review for 2024</a>. "More than just a cozy farming sim, eight years of updates have grown Stardew Valley into a modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on," we said.</p><p>These updates have slowed down progress on ConcernedApe's next game Haunted Chocolatier though, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concernedape-hasnt-worked-on-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-because-of-troublesome-console-and-mobile-ports-of-stardew-valley-16">Barone said in August he hasn't worked on it "in a long time"</a> due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">the grandiose version 1.6 update</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Already Leaked Online]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-already-leaked-online/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-already-leaked-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise these days that a game has leaked just weeks before its release, and this time, it's happened to Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-sees-zelda-using-a-sword/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. This title is set for release on September 26, and allegedly copies of the game have already leaked online. Just on Friday, the game showed up for the first time on the internet, so now Nintendo has to try and get rid of any footage or gameplay, as it is illegal to have the game via emulation already. The ROM for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has been confirmed by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> in a YouTube video, but he has stated that he will not share it as it is "illegal and career-ending to do so."</p>
<p><iframe title="Zelda Echoes of Wisdom Has Fully Leaked Online!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaoF0C0YsC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't Nintendo's first rodeo, as 2023 was full of leaks for Nintendo. Content from Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom surfaced online, as well as content from Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Additionally, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fully leaked online two weeks before its official release date. Metroid Dread, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl were also caught in the crossfire of being leaked on the internet before their release dates.</p>
<p>With Nintendo's strict rules about piracy, emulation, and game conservation, this is not surprising. ROMs of their most famous games from the 90s have been removed from the internet for years, including those who try to make fan games or mods. In addition, Nintendo has recently been giving out orders to retailers to cancel people's pre-orders of their first-party games. This was recently seen with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.</p>
<p>Nintendo never gave a reason for why they were doing that, but people assumed that it was so that the employees couldn't get hold of the game early, create a ROM, and pirate the game. It makes sense that Nintendo would make this decision when, just last year, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gamestop-employee-who-shared-tears-of-the-kingdom-leak-says-he-was-fired-at-nintendos-request/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop fired an employee</a> for doing that with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Compared to other current-gen consoles, the Nintendo Switch is incredibly easy to emulate and get running on a PC, just as previous Nintendo consoles have been. This is in contrast to consoles like the PlayStation 3, which is notoriously difficult to get running smoothly on a PC, no matter how powerful the rig is.</p>
<p>It now means that those who have legally bought The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will have to try to dodge all sorts of spoilers on the internet until September 26. That is much easier said than done, as spoilers have a way of popping up everywhere.</p>

            <p>To survive in looter-booter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> you have to keep the paranormal station wagon you drive around in good nick. You're constantly repairing corroded doors and swapping out busted engine parts with cobbled-together technology. But maybe this tinkering was a little too much. Our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pacific-drive-review">review</a> praised the game for its "trunk loads of atmosphere" but called the constant need to craft stuff "laborious". If you also felt this, then good news. An update now lets you fiddle the difficulty options a generous amount, say developers Ironwood Studios, making the game easier and bringing crafting needs right down.</p>
<p>Buuut... if you thought the opposite - that the game wasn't hard enough - you can now tick a box that makes hitting yourself with the trunk door kill you stone dead.</p>

<p>Most of the changes are mentioned in the trailer above, and detailed in full in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">an update post on Steam</a>. But to give you a summary, there are now a bunch of fresh difficulty presets. "Scenic Drive" lowers crafting requirements and makes it impossible to die, for example. While "Joyride" keeps the mortal threat but minimises hazards and says that "gathering, crafting, and research requirements are all lowered." 

</p><p>If you are currently screaming "NO, THE BANJAXED CAR IS THE WHOLE POINT." Then, firstly, wow, relax. Secondly, this update also offers some very challenging presets as a contrast. "Olympic Gauntlet" ups the difficulty of everything - hazards, crafting, car damage, you name it. "Iron Wagon" makes everything similarly tough but also notes that "failing a run will delete your save file." </p><p> There is also the "Mechanic's Road Trip" option, which states: "Terrain and the status of the car impact driving more. Items to repair the car are more costly to craft, and can't be crafted on a run." Which sounds like somebody took an important-looking cylinder out of the roguelike's bonnet and installed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> straight into the engine block. </p>
<p>You can also go crazy on a bunch of difficulty sliders, say the devs, and create your own custom mode. Your flat tires can now be flatter, for example, and the radiation more radioactive. You could turn off the "instability storms" that threaten you during a run. Or you could make your engine go more vroom-vroom. There's also that fatal car boot I mentioned at the start of the article - an option titled: "Trunk Bonk kills". Don't laugh! Car boots are dangerous. My friend concussed a girl while on a date by absent-mindedly slamming the boot down while she was still looking for something. They got married and had babies. It is possible the concussion is to blame.</p>
<p>There are other changes in the update. You can now have your own music play through the car radio, and your garage's jukebox, by loading the files directly into a local folder in the game directory. That's cool. An undersung strength of the road-tripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> was its soundtrack, which had some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3MACUEAimI&amp;list=PLnF67y5vNQETIXmLg3Kes717M9vfDhqtV">pretty good tunes</a> (my favourite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61UPO8npOHc">Bloodoath by Exes &amp; Petey</a>).</p>
<p>I quite liked the pace of crafting when I toyed with Pacific Drive, but it's true it slowed me down enough to lose momentum and not finish the game. Difficulty is tough to measure, and often one of the best things you can do is just hand the nitty-gritty of that decision straight to the players. So fair play. </p>
<p><em>Disclosure: Paul Dean, a former contributor to RPS and my former fellow-in-board-games, did some writing for Pacific Drive. This explains why it's so weird.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the issues at play was apparently the profit margin that Intel wanted on each unit sold. Another thing that seemingly helped put AMD over the top was the fact that sticking with the chip maker would help limit potential issues around backwards compatibility for the next-gen console. </p><p>AMD designed the CPU and GPU for both the PS4 and PS5. In addition to the existing relationship, the continuation in manufacturing processes was likely part of why the transition between the two console generations was so smooth, with PS5 owners gaining access to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sorry-the-ps5-wont-be-backwards-compatible-with-ps3-p-1845102114#:~:text=Culture-,Sorry">thousands of games from the older console</a></span> as soon as it launched. A similar transition for the PS6 would ensure three generations of of games, and players’ libraries, potentially all available on one device. </p><p>That’s in stark contrast to the PS3, whose unique Nvidia-based “cell” processor created all sorts of problems for developers porting games to the console and for Sony trying to get PS3 games playable on PS4. Without compatible hardware, software solutions are required, which can be costly and require huge investments from the console maker. Instead, Sony has so far opted to simply make PS3 games available on the PS5 solely through cloud gaming on the most expensive “Premium” tier of PS Plus. </p><p>The PS4 console cycle lasted seven years, and the PS5 one could go on even longer.

The PS5 Pro, coming in November for $700, could end up being the halfway point between the current generation and the release of a PS6.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out-ps6-release-date-details.982029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When is the PS6 coming out? <span>This question is</span> beginning to be asked following the announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>,&nbsp;and in this article, we’ll try to break it down.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t currently a direct answer as to when the PS6 release date will be confirmed, but court documents suggest that PlayStation has a year in mind. Dating back to court documents relating to the CMA’s investigation of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, count documents revealed that both Microsoft and Sony are not expecting to release their next-generation consoles until 2028.</p>



<p>“Indeed, the next new generation of consoles is not expected to be released before the fall of 2028 at the very earliest”, the documents read. While the court documents are from late 2022, and things can change, it does suggest that the PS6 will be released around 2028.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, we have various documents and first-hand accounts that imply that PlayStation has been back and forth on the date, but for the sake of argument, we’d like to think that PlayStation aims to release the PS6 in 2028.</p>



<p>Of course, things can change, but publicly and privately, that seems to be the direction the company is heading.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-will-have-amd-chip-with-backwards-compatibility-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report from&nbsp;Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>As for the next generation Xbox consoles, there are rumors within the community that suggest that Xbox might try to get ahead of the competition this generation and release their next generation console sooner. This could indicate that the next-generation Xbox could be released in 2026-2027, but we have no sources to corroborate the rumors.</p>



<p>When do you think the PS6 is coming out? Let us know in the comments below or in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong is easily the biggest success registered by a Chinese developer so far with a premium game. Earlier this month, we learned that the action RPG had sold 18 million units; however, Daniel Camilo, an industry analyst based in China, <a href="https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1835068254416781433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that Game Science's debut title is now around the 20 million units milestone. In the same tweet, Camilo also revealed to have heard from certain sources that the first Black Myth: Wukong DLC will be released in early 2025, around the new Chinese Year festivity, so between the end of January and early February.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor</a>, Game Science is preparing at least two DLCs before moving on with the inevitable sequel. Of course, the studio is still working on the delayed Xbox Series S|X port, too, with Microsoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denying</a> that the delay had anything to do with its consoles' limitations.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Black Myth: Wukong earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Francesco De Meo, who summarized his experience with the game as follows:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

            <p>If you're a fan of rhythm games and fun bops, then you might want to bookmark ol' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyperbeat">Hyperbeat</a>. Set in a wireframe world, you're to chop, dodge or ride notes as you slam your "hyperknight" through a tunnel at high speed. There's a subtle, dreamy story element to your musical journey, with confusing dialogue and a nice cherry blossom tree. Hmmm, curious. Anyway yeah, it looks rad.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm sure rhythm game fanatics will say Hyperbeat looks like many other rhythm games. For me, it's a bit of a mash-up between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez</a>, in which you you float through a stylised, polygonal world, and <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/">Osu!</a>, in which you click or hold or follow circular beats as they pop-up on screen. In Hyperbeat you do a bit of both, determined by the colour and shape of the beat you're about to collide with. It looks like it's all about steering your knight gracefully into beats and making the right decisions so the jungle or electronic tunes flow smoothly.</p>

All the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/">Steam page</a> says is that it's home to an original soundtrack with a "progression system", whatever that means. Workshop support is a fantastic touch - these sorts of games thrive off people's creations. Oh and difficulty and accessibility options mean it won't be impenetrable, hopefully.</p>
<p>I'm intrigued by the one snippet of story we do see, which is a sad looking tree telling us not to forget to rest. Cheers pal.</p>
<p>There's no release date on this one, but it's due out sometime this year. You can follow it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2263360/HYPERBEAT/">Steam</a> if you'd like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I disagree to some extent. Ubisoft may not always strike gold, but they understand how to make an entertaining popcorn game that leaves you wanting more. Although that <em>more </em>often comes include elements that are reminiscent of other games.</p><p>Here, in recommending games to follow your <em>Outlaws</em> experience with, we’ll focus on similar open-world adventures with freewheeling decision-making that provide players with senses of wonder and unparalleled potential. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-recommend-id="image://acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-recommend-id="image://acec6ff231851c10e7e8a0c96c90e1dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While it doesn’t match the overall scope of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> does similarly place you in the shoes of a strong, capable woman hellbent on making her way in life. As Lara Croft, you will utilize stealth, cunning, and trickery to ambush enemies in the jungle, craft tools and equipment, upgrade your gear, and venture deep into a mysterious story that takes you to equally mysterious locales.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-recommend-id="image://5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->CD PROJEKT RED</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-recommend-id="image://5a029962f945b69b1e7f816d0a922ad5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you missed out on <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> due to its abysmal launch, you owe it to yourself to give CD Projekt RED’s magnum opus a second glance. It’s a highly stable, exceptionally well-written, and downright entertaining open-world action RPG with much to offer. You can lose yourself in Night City, immersing yourself as V in the seedy underbelly of a city gone haywire. The possibilities for how you approach missions and build your character alone will push you to return for multiple playthroughs.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-recommend-id="image://9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Guerrilla / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-recommend-id="image://9711fb5cb6998f218d5ab84247f9322e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> continues Aloy’s story as she sets out on an all-new adventure toward the West Coast of the former United States of America. Along the way, she’ll encounter unique tribes, new machines, and plenty of gameplay mechanics that remind us of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. This, of course, includes stealth takedowns, but wrapped in a more cohesive and polished package. Aloy is a compelling character with likes, dislikes, goals, and adversaries that affect how the story plays out before our very eyes.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-recommend-id="image://7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bend Studio / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-recommend-id="image://7694c0e991cec4917ab1546a8bf8533e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Days Gone</em> has been in the headlines lately for all the wrong reasons, but it’s still an exceptional open-world game that flew under the radar after its rough launch. The story of Deek, roaming the post-apocalyptic landscape of Oregon as a drifter and bounty hunter, creates a compelling narrative that most find difficult to put down. If you don’t mind investing upwards of 70 hours in a single playthrough, <em>Days Gone</em> stands a cut above the rest as an immersive and heart-wrenching story of survival.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-recommend-id="image://72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-recommend-id="image://72b853555e9d7ff0ba051385d9496d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do we even need to tout the overall impressive nature of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>? It’s arguably one of the finest video game tales written and produced, with the most compelling, authentic characters to date. And that’s not to mention the immersive, expansive, and realistic game world you can spend hundreds of hours exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang goes down in the history books, and if you enjoy open-world titles whatsoever, you owe it to yourself to play this one straight through!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-recommend-id="image://359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-recommend-id="image://359854e09ea6be2c8a2d32b6929fc711" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To this point, we’ve highlighted numerous open-world games that attempt to provide players with untold freedom. <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>, while large in scope, provides a more streamlined, story-based experience for those who want a better look at the cutthroat lives and world of fortune hunters. Kay Vess loves her credits, and Nathan Drake loves priceless antiquities lost to time. They’re both valuable, but the journeys to each, while similar, prove more perilous at times for one more so than the other.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-recommend-id="image://3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-recommend-id="image://3da83a9b1f2c16bcfe56b0e48f16192c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Returning to a world full of freedom, <em>Far Cry 6</em> places you in the shoes of Dani, a cunning but initially unwilling guerrilla in a fight for their entire country. While it’s certainly not everyone’s favorite entry in the long-running FPS series, it does have certain charms. The world design is some of the best, really thrusting you into its hellish paradise, with a wide array of vehicles—including horses—to traverse the environment and countless weapons that help vary how you approach missions.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-recommend-id="image://92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Respawn / Electronic Arts</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-recommend-id="image://92e3b8b03cee1c49358b308e4f07f0a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you found yourself thoroughly enjoying <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> primarily due to its IP and setting, then you’ll obviously want to jump straight into another recent game from the science-fiction franchise. <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em> launched in rough shape but, thanks to recent updates, is now a genuinely fun experience. As Cal, you feel powerful. You wield a lightsaber, Force powers, and the ability to parkour across the environment. It’s story-focused and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-elden-ring-games-like-black-myth-wukong-1851642869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-elden-ring-games-like-black-myth-wukong-1851642869">somewhat Soulslike</a></span>, making it more of a challenge than <em>Outlaws</em> yet still approachable.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-recommend-id="image://da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-recommend-id="image://da7abd1b0cfa819dde990390ad506eb7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When it comes to story-centric games, we would place <em>The Last of Us</em> up there alongside <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It’s one of the most memorable tales, now with a sequel and a television series have both done quite well. The story of Joel and Ellie traveling across the post-apocalyptic wasteland while avoiding Clickers and worse sticks with you long after you finish the campaign. If <em>Outlaws</em> left you wanting more from its story and unique setting, then <em>The Last of Us</em> should, too.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-recommend-id="image://ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda Game Studios / Bethesda Softworks</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-recommend-id="image://ec8b9000e7415b8889d4a3f1781b6015" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one may prove divisive, as you either hate or love <em>Starfield</em>. Its massive scale, with more than 1,000 planets to explore, may at times feel lifeless. But when compared to some of <em>Star Wars Outlaws’</em> occasionally lackluster<em>&nbsp;</em>exploration, <em>Starfield </em>has a leg up. Especially if you don’t mind a bit of procedural generation in your points of interest. If that sounds like you, it’ll be easy to lose yourself in the Settled Systems for potentially hundreds of hours.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this year, San Francisco 49ers running back--and last year's Offensive Player of the Year--Christian McCaffrey was named the cover athlete for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a>. But unfortunately, McCaffrey has been placed on injured reserve with calf soreness and Achilles tendinitis. As part of the IR designation, McCaffrey will miss at least the first four games of the season.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41258841/sources-49ers-christian-mccaffrey-ir-next-4-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESPN</a>, McCaffrey had a history of injuries when he was a member of the Carolina Panthers in 2020 and 2021. For those two seasons, McCaffrey played in 10 games total. Since arriving in San Francisco, McCaffrey has played in 32 out of the 49ers' 33 games. But given McCaffrey's recent appearance on Madden NFL 25's cover, his injury has reinvigorated talk about the so-called Madden curse.</p><p>The late John Madden was primarily featured on the cover of the video games that shared his name prior to 1998. Once NFL players were featured on the cover, it gave rise to theory that there was some sort of Madden curse that would doom the cover athletes to either an injury or a subpar season. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/does-madden-nfl-cover-curse-still-exist-a-look-back-at-25-years-of-covers-after-christian-mccaffrey-nod/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS Sports</a> recently ran an analysis of the Madden curse by looking back at what happened to the last 24 athletes who appeared on the cover. 14 players either suffered an injury or had diminished playing skills afterwards.</p><p>Of course, the most likely explanation for the Madden curse is that football is a brutally physical game that wears down even the strongest bodies. Only a handful of players make it though their careers without missing games to injuries. But that probably won't stop the Madden curse conspiracy theorists from pointing to McCaffrey as the latest victim.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psychotherapy-sim-vampire-therapist-to-get-three-major-free-updates.981972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-free-updates<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Little Bat Games has revealed that three major free&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>updates are on the way, bringing new scenarios for you to discover.</p>
<p>The first of those updates, "The Blood of Troy", is available today, and it begins a three-part story in which you'll be administering (vampire) therapy to your 3000-year-old mentor. As you can imagine, a vampire that old will have some baggage he's carrying around.</p>
<p>Two more updates will then arrive prior to the end of 2024. "Spanish Nights" will explore pre-Renaissance Spain, while "Fathoms Below" will focus on "the birth of psychoanalysis", according to a press release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=RGoDveS- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-updates-dialogue.jpg?itok=KOQQvX20 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>is getting some updates for you to, uh, sink your teeth into.</figcaption></figure><p>Creative director Cyrus Nemati says that&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>"has touched players in ways we could not have anticipated", and that the updates should serve as a "nice treat to invite players back into our world to learn more about our oldest vampire".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist</em>, well, the clue's in the name; you are Sam, a former gunslinger who decides to become a therapist for his fellow bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>Sam's clients include "self-hating vampires, agoraphobic social media addicts, supernatural narcissists, and victims of centuries-old capitalistic systems", so as you can probably imagine, this is a game with a lot to say about the real world, vampires or no.</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>looks like a visual novel, it is, in fact, a "fully-voiced interactive play", and you'll have plenty of options when it comes to interacting with your clients and deciding what to say to them.</p>

<p><em>Vampire Therapist&nbsp;</em>has a pretty star-studded cast as well as a fascinating premise. It boasts the voice talent of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2"><em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>star Matt Mercer and&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>'s Sarah Grayson</a>, among others.</p>

While unexplained, this was presumably an effort to plug the leaks where physical copies of a game are sent to stores days or weeks in advance of street date, so that shelves can be stocked for midnight, and orders sent out to customers can arrive at their homes day one. But obviously this also creates an opportunity for staff to get hold of a copy, create a ROM, and pirate the game. Last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-edition-switch-gamestop-leak-fired-1850329759&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-edition-switch-gamestop-leak-fired-1850329759">GameStop fired an employee for doing exactly that with <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-dungeons-still-world-1851636866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-dungeons-still-world-1851636866">New <em>Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom</em> Trailer Reveals It Has A Whole Second World</a></span></p><p>This is a problem that’s exacerbated by another aspect unique to the Switch: it’s a current-gen console that’s easily emulated on PC. Emulators are usually about two console generations behind, and there’s currently little sign of stable, working PS4 or Xbox One emus, and 360 emulation isn’t going <em>great</em>. But the Switch was relatively old tech even on its 2017 release, which meant emulators appeared almost straight away, and seven years later they’re now capable of running Switch games at far higher resolutions and framerates than the Nintendo console itself. This means leaked ROMs aren’t the purvey of piracy carts as was the case with the Nintendo DS, but instead are easily captured PC games, making it ludicrously simple to upload footage online.</p><p>Thus, Nintendo is now issuing a flurry of takedown notifications on videos that are appearing on YouTube, showing the first Zelda-led <em>Zelda </em>game being played ten days ahead of the game going on sale.</p><p>The severity of such a situation is often in the eye of the beholder. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-tears-kingdom-switch-yuzu-emulate-pirate-1851293463&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-zelda-tears-kingdom-switch-yuzu-emulate-pirate-1851293463">Nintendo claims that <em>TotK</em> was pirated one million times</a></span> in court cases related to the matter.

<p>The next-generation PlayStation 6 (PS6) is already well in development, and major decisions on the console have already been made.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, the new PS6 will, once again, feature an AMD chip in the system. The report says that Sony and Intel were in talks, but Intel lost the contract to AMD back in 2022.</p>



<p>The report claims that one of the disputes between Intel and Sony involved how much profit Intel would make from each processor. On top of the price dispute, backwards compatibility is said to be a major sticking point with Sony. </p>



<p>“Moving from AMD, which made the PlayStation 5 chip, to Intel would have risked backwards compatibility, which was a subject of discussion between Intel and Sony engineers and executives,” the report states. “Ensuring backward compatibility with prior versions of the PlayStation would have been costly and taken engineering resources.”</p>



<p>Whether that means backwards compatibility with just PS5 and PS4 games or that means further back in the PlayStation catalog is currently unknown.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sony staying with AMD for the PS6 processor?

The modding tool was only unlocked a week ago on September 9 so this is still a very early version of what's possible, but it's a sign of bigger and better things to come when modders inevitably spend months and years creating custom content.</p><p>A YouTube video of the <a href="https://youtu.be/_LOF3d7aLZ0?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">castle</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/wKBkko6KJhA?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avernus map</a> were shared too, showing Baldur's Gate 3 characters Wyll and Astarion walking around in them as normally as they would the official game. Screenshots in the Reddit posts show the maps too, and while both are still quite basic, katszenBurger has plans to expand their creations.</p><p>"I had a lava area planned too, and maybe I could make the lake explorable a bit," they said on the Avernus map. "Dialogue is a work in progress in the editor, as are some of the environmental elements." But characters can walk around, pick up items, fight enemies, and so on. katszenBurger also said map making is "very simple," meaning others will have easy access to create maps of their own.</p><p>While console players can enjoy the wealth of mods being made purely through the official Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit, maps like these will remain out of reach unless Larian decides to fully unlock it itself. CEO Swen Vincke said in March this won't be happening, but perhaps plans will change after players managed it themselves.</p><p>The toolkit arrived alongside Patch 7, which added lots of other content including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>. Players will also be relieved to hear that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-is-not-the-final-update-larian-confirms-but-it-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-whats-coming-just-yet">it's not the final Baldur's Gate 3 patch after all</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review of the game</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It seemed novel, and not to mention, I was a huge </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan growing up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This lore foundation was inspiring, and even though it's buried really deep in the final game, you'll find it woven throughout various dialogues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the early game design document, the levels were much wilder. I had a jazz emporium level where all of the creatures played instruments, a junkyard level where all of humanity's lost ideas were thrown into, etc. The levels were wacky and Fictional, so I called their inhabitants Fictions. The scope for the levels was too high, but the Fictions and overall vision remained.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us a bit about the process of designing a Fiction? How did you pick concepts to make into creatures, and how did you take those concepts and give them physical animal shapes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Skylar Surra was helping out with concept art. I'd give both him and Daniel Kraft the Fiction design, their quests, what the Fictions were going to do, the landscape they would be in, etc. They would then handle the details.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Daniel Kraft took over the concept as well and started making pieces of the Fictions modular, copying elements between them. This sped up our process greatly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to the game's playful art style? Why choose this visual style for your unique creatures and world?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Limitations! Many of our art assets are from a variety of online asset stores. We didn't have a dedicated artist, so the levels fell on me to "art" up. I relied on lighting for cohesion, which I learned by watching a lot of Udemy tutorials.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other benefit of our visual style is performance. By keeping the poly count low, we could focus more on making the game fun and less on constantly optimizing it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Fictions do a variety of poses so long as the player solves puzzles in the environment. What thoughts went into creating the various actions and poses some of the creatures do?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We tried to bring their personalities out on the map with their poses, interactions, sounds, etc. The Fictions don't care about the puzzles themselves; they just care about the outcome. For example, Mudwog doesn't care that we moved the lanterns closer to him to attract the bugs. He just wants the bugs. If you give Mudwog bugs, then it's a great opportunity for more poses to take pictures of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interacting with Fictions on Dream's Doorstep is our biggest differentiator since it allows you to speak with them and understand their quirks and habits. For example, Mudwog has no ego, but Wullard does! If you throw a donut at Mudwog, he doesn't care, but throwing a donut at Wullard will make him mad enough to smash into a rock, open a new path, and get a new pose for you to take a picture of.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what thoughts went into the environmental puzzles players could solve? How did you shape puzzles so they fit into the natural environments of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Jay Watford and I figured out tools that would give us a variety of mechanics to play with. Jason Burton then helped to make these mechanics look and feel good from an art and VFX perspective. From there, I'd mark out puzzle areas on the levels and revisit them throughout development, adding more where applicable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the time, it would be looking at the environment feature and thinking, "Hmm... I bet we could add a magnet puzzle here" or something along those lines. I'd then work it into the level to fit it in the best I could. For example, adding more rocks around if it was a magnet, trying to find dark places for the lanterns, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Friendship is an important element alongside photography in this game. What appealed to you about letting players befriend the Fictions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's just more fun to talk with characters than insentient creatures. It gives us more to work with in terms of minigames, quests, and IP. If the Fictions were similar to wild animals and didn't appreciate the things you did for them, it wouldn't be as satisfying. Imagine if all of the Fiction dialogue was "roar" or "grrr." This might be funny for a second, but it gets old quickly. When you get to know the oddities of Fictions, their wants, their history, etc., helping them becomes a much greater reward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating the minigames you play to become friends with the Fictions? What do you feel the minigames, as well as friendships, added to this photo-taking experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was all Max Shawabkeh. When Max joined, it unlocked a whole world of possibility for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He's a truly exceptional engineer and can really do it all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Max suggested we could have minigames on Dream's Doorstep instead of simply talking to them, I lit up. It was a great way to add depth to the game, giving players many more ways to engage with Fictions and get to know them in a way that simple text never could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think that the minigames are one of the most quintessential pieces of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Without them, we wouldn't have Jo'keel's Comedy Club or Justaplant's Court Case. These quests, while optional, show Fictions in a special light and imprint lasting memories. It makes you want to go back into the level and get the best picture you can of that Fiction.</span></p><p>Image via The Alekon Company.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> grades players based on their picture. How did you choose the criteria by which to grade the picture? What sort of work went into programming the game to be able to score the players on how well they did?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our goals for this were:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Easy to understand and objective.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not trivial, so we could make some Fictions and poses more challenging to photograph than others.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not so specific that the players couldn't express their creativity.</span><br></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Max, the coding itself was straightforward. It was designing the criteria and tweaking the difficulty that took time. We referenced all other photography games out there but landed on our ranking system since it made the most sense for the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players can freely roam the game or explore it on-rails. What drew you to have these two systems? What challenges or benefits did you face in letting players be able to do both?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we were playtesting early on, we felt that the game needed more than just an on-rails experience. Exploring on foot gave it a totally different feel. Players could take their time, set up the perfect shot, interact with more of the level, etc. The gameplay possibilities opened up. What's also nice is that the on-rails gameplay tours you around the level and familiarizes you with it before you unlock free roam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, free roam did take a lot of work. I had to add many more meshes to prevent the player from escaping the level, make sure that the surfaces all felt good to traverse upon, add more exclusive things that you could only do while free-roaming, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also had different rules for on-rails vs free roam, such as what happens when you jump on a Fiction while in free roam, what happens when you pass through one while on rails, etc. The work was worth it, though.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players have some ability to get creative with edits and certain toys. How did you decide on the tools players would have to jazz up their photos? How did you implement abilities that would make the pictures more interesting or fun?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creativity is a pillar for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and we constantly tried to work it into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had a lot of Google sheets with our ideas for minigames, quest rewards, etc. Most of the time, we came up with the idea, wrote it on the spreadsheet, and then iterated on it from there. If it seemed like something that would allow expression and be fun to interact with, we then assigned it as a reward to one of the Fictions based on their personality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most gratifying elements is seeing how other players use these tools. We have a small Discord where people have posted their favorite photos, their Dream's Doorstep decorations, etc. Everyone adds a different twist to it, and many have been inspired by the game. We've had a person cry during the ending of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while streaming, a person who created an entire wiki for the game by himself, and even a person who is now incorporating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alekon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Fictions into his own indie game titled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Abomi Nation: Monster Rifts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, our goal was to empower players with creative tools that not only enhance their in-game experience but also inspire them to express themselves and connect with others in ways that extend far beyond the game itself.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Gaming history makes for a fascinating subject to read about, and if you're looking to dive deep into the hidden stories behind Nintendo's NES and Game Boy systems, you'll want to check out these two books. Written by well-known gaming historian Florent George, these are the long-awaited translations of the third and fourth volumes in The History of Nintendo series and are now available through Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History Of the Famicom/NES</a> is available for $28 and you can pair that with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8N8QJ3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The History Of The Game Boy</a> at the same price.</p><p>So what makes these books so different? Gorge's unofficial history books go deep into the business of Nintendo, covering the company's origins when it started selling playing cards and eventually rose to prominence as a video game giant. Instead of relying on widely available facts, Gorge unearthed surprising secrets and revelations to explore the secret history of Nintendo.</p><div title="6526492 - History of NES and Game Boy" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2665" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526492 - History of NES and Game Boy" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The History Of the Famicom/NES</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG8NZF18?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$28</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This newly translated volume chronicles the rise of Nintendo from 1983-2016, focusing on the Family Computer (Famicom) that would come to be known as the Nintendo Entertainment System in the rest of the world.

			<p>Like its two predecessors, the PlayStation 6 console will be powered by an AMD chip, but that apparently wasn't a guarantee until 2022, when Intel lost the bid to design Sony's new system.</p>
<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-intel-lost-sony-playstation-business-2024-09-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, Intel and AMD were the two final contenders in the bidding process for the contract. Reportedly, a dispute over how much profit would Intel make from each chip sold to Sony blocked Intel from settling on the price. AMD, on the other hand, got the contract through a competitive bidding process that eliminated other contenders until only Intel was left. Discussions between Intel and Sony went on for a few months in 2022 and involved meetings between the two companies' CEOs, engineers, and executives.</p>
<p>Intel provided a comment to Reuters regarding the failed PlayStation 6 bid, saying that they "<em>strongly disagree with this characterization but are not going to comment about any current or potential customer conversations</em>." AMD declined to comment.</p>
<p>While being unable to settle on a price played some role in the decision, compatibility concerns were also taken into consideration, as going from AMD to Intel for the PlayStation 6 would have put backward compatibility in jeopardy. This was a matter of discussion between engineers and executives from both companies.</p>
<p>As the PlayStation 6 is still years away from release, it is not surprising that we know very little about the system as of now. Earlier this year, we learned that Sony aims to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful next-generation system</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> will play a big role in delivering what manufacturers are teasing as the biggest generational leap ever.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splatoon-3-updates-coming-to-an-end-seasonal-events-to-continue.981915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that regular&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates are coming to a close, but if you're a regular player, don't worry; this isn't quite the end for the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1835506615971356881" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Nintendo says that while regular updates are ending, seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-splatoween">Splatoween</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-spring-fest">Spring Fest</a>, and Summer Nights will continue "with some returning themes", so you'll still have plenty to do in&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, regular balance updates adjusting weapons "will be released as needed", and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges will all "continue for the time being", Nintendo says. Of course, that wording also implies that these events could end at any time, so stay sharp.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-match.jpg?itok=08CI08x6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-match.jpg?itok=fGlCe38J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates are ending, but the game's not going anywhere.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, this also means the servers won't be shut down anytime soon, so you'll still be able to head into&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>and find a game; you just won't be getting any more major content drops.</p>
<p><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>updates ending at this point makes sense; Nintendo supported&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>for around two years, with the game's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-releases-splatoon-2s-final-significant-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">final major update landing in July 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether or not this signals that Nintendo is gearing up to make&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, of course.&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>was originally announced in early 2021 as part of a Nintendo Direct, which would mean it was revealed about a year and a half after&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>updates ended.</p>
<p>If this timeline is indicative of Nintendo's current plans, we can probably expect a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>announcement sometime in early 2026, and that means it'll probably be arriving on whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">the Switch's successor</a> turns out to be called.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-city.jpg?itok=wXE7W50V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-updates-ending-city.jpg?itok=t5O7o4-2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we be getting a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 4&nbsp;</em>announcement in 2026?</figcaption></figure><p>That's all speculation, though, and right now,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is still very much a going concern. Updates might have ended, but the servers aren't going anywhere, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>action, your best bet is still&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p>
<p>You can pick the game up <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/splatoon-3-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Alruna And The Necro-Industrialists opens with paired quotes from T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland and Mad Max: Fury Road - a blend of influences that would typically get you kicked out of the Creative Writing Club for being simultaneously too fancy and too obvious, but the game beyond the epigraph looks pretty swish.</p>
<p>It's "a compact and high-density <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>, with a focus on sequence-breaking and playing things out of order". It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that "slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world". Also, you play a thorn witch who looks a bit like 1950s Tinkerbell, with a touch of Betty Boop. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alruna is a dryad in a dying world - a spirit of life in the land of the dead. The earth is sucked dry. There is only The Sprawl. Poor, bedraggled skele-men dot the Wasteland of the Necro-Industrialists and shuffle endlessly back and forth in a toiling mockery of life. But are they the real enemy? Or do the skeletons suffer just as much as the dryads under the domination of the Necro-Industrialists? </p>
<p>And salvation? Is it possible? Dead men yearn for Heaven. But the dead can only dig... </p></blockquote>
<p>I've just given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2655470/Alruna_and_the_NecroIndustrialists/">the Steam demo</a> a shot, and this is a very assured production. You get a chargeable jump, a dash move and a slide by default, plus a choice of weapons and items plucked from the crevices of a world that includes four temples (plus a possible fifth "secret" temple, which isn't that secret given that they've mentioned it on the Steam page).</p>
<p>The music is pretty stylish, and there are familiar puzzle setups such as flipping switches to make certain platforms dematerialise while others grow solid. Power-ups include exploding mushrooms, magic vines and electro-plants. It's packing in a fair bit, though the square aspect room-based format makes everything feel quite tidy.</p>
<p>Aside from platform-puzzle gambits, we can expect hidden minigames, "a star-crossed enemies-to-lovers romance with a rival adventurer" and several story endings. It's got a pretty unvarnished anti-capitalist thing going on, without (so far) being didactic. One friendly character you meet complains about "endless progress and infinite growth". There is definitely scope for more Wasteland quotation here but hopefully, they'll restrain themselves.</p>
<p>The full game is out on 26th September. Developers Neckbolt are also working on pocket-sized trick-or-treat platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165420/October_Panic/">October Panic</a>. Their past releases include <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/602430/Yono_and_the_Celestial_Elephants/">Yono And The Celestial Elephants</a>, which Alec (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-new-steam-games-oct">deemed</a> an "almost absurdly wholesome Zeldalike", corpse girl adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/351340/Belladonna/">Belladona</a>, which seems a little less wholesome, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407400/Molly_Medusa_Queen_of_Spit/">Molly Medusa: Queen Of Spit</a>, in which you can walk on walls and turn things to stone. A studio to keep an eye on, probably.</p>
<p>If you like the aesthetic and ambience here, but could do without the combat, may I suggest trying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everdeep-aurora-is-hollow-knight-for-people-who-love-game-boys-and-are-weary-of-combat">Everdeep Aurora</a> or perhaps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/void-stranger-out-now-looks-like-a-wonderful-game-boy-nightmare">Void Stranger</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
