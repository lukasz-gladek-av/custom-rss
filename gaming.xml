		<p>11 bit Studios and Digital Sun Games have confirmed that Moonlighter 2 will: The Endless Vault will be available through Steam Early Access from October 23rd. The early access will give players access to three different biomes where around 120 relics can be discovered which can then be sold in the shop, but you will have to fight different types of enemies to get your hands on them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OCz8WarKos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When you are not venturing out to find relics, you will need to manage the shop where prices need to be set, customer demands to be met, and make the shop look good. There are also over 100 shop and dungeon perks that will offer various buffs to the players too. The combat system will have four main weapons that players can switch between depending on preferred styles.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Moonlighter review, Jason said, <em>“Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</em></p>

		<p>A new story trailer has been released for Silent Hill f, with this trailer giving a bit more context of what to expect in the game. Hinako Shimizu, the main character seems to be guided by a character that says she saved him. He wears a wolf mask and it is not known exactly what he will be to Hinako Shimizu. Check out the trailer below.</p>

Immerse yourself into Hinako’s world as imagined by renowned author Ryukishi07, with entrancing soundscapes by Akira Yamaoka and beautiful visuals in a gripping tale of doubt, regret, and inescapable choices. Will Hinako embrace the beauty hidden within terror, or succumb to the madness that lies ahead? Discover a new chapter in the SILENT HILL series, blending psychological horror with a haunting Japanese setting.”</em></p>

		<p>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando is out next year and we finally have a gameplay trailer. It looks a bit like Saber’s big hit, World War Z, but with a lot more humour and neon.&nbsp; You get to play as one of the Toxic Commandos and team up with your friends (cross-platform co-op is included) to send the Sludge God and his “horde of things-that-should-never-be” back to the underworld.</p>
<p>The game was scheduled for 2024 but will now be released next year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Saber say “f you’re the kind of person who likes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddy-movie vibes and the over-the-top humor, action, and horror of classic 80s cinema, inspired by the legendary John Carpenter…</li>
<li>Teaming up with friends to face down hordes of monsters who want to eat your face…</li>
<li>An explosive cocktail of visceral FPS action and apocalyptic environments…</li>
<li>Upgrading your skills and testing new abilities against increasingly hardcore challenges…</li>
<li>Saving the planet against impossible odds…</li>
</ul>
<p>… then now’s your time to go commando!”</p>

<p>“It’s exciting to be collaborating on a new video game with Focus and Saber,” said John Carpenter. “Look, I really like shooting zombies. They keep telling me that they’re called ’the infected.’ Please. They’re ghouls, dude. They blow up real good and there are a ton of them. People are going to love this game.”</p>

<p>I HAVE THE POWER!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Limited Run Games and Mattel are teaming up with Bitmap Bureau to bring us a brand new pixel art side-scrolling He-Man game in 2026 on Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/he-man_and_the_masters_of_the_universe_dragon_pearl_of_destruction">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Dragon Pearl of Destruction</a> will feature 12 stages from the iconic toy line and cartoon where you'll be able to play as He-Man, Teela, Man-At-Arms, and a range of other favourites. Skeletor is the one you'll be taking on — eventually. Oh, and of course you can ride Battle Cat.</p>
<p>So, Bitmap, we have to ask — what's it like handling <em>two</em> iconic '80s icons with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D</a> and now He-Man?</p>

<p>The Masters of the Universe return to the gaming scene in 2026; physical and digital pre-orders will be coming early next year.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking forward to a new He-Man game? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Geoff Keighley's traditional Gamescom Opening Night Live returned this year to bring new game announcements and brand-new trailers for upcoming games, such as The Outer Worlds 2. The trailer provides an overview of the game's companions and playfully adds that players won't be able to sleep with them (Obsidian has previously noted that they'd rather not do romance at all instead of half-baking it).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Companions Trailer - Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8nVW5UGIcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regardless of that, the sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obsidian's sci-fi first-person action roleplaying game from 2019</a> aims to be better in every possible way. The first The Outer Worlds game was, after all, made with a relatively small budget provided by Take-Two's indie-like publisher Private Division (now defunct). The Outer Worlds 2, however, was developed entirely after Microsoft acquired Obsidian.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the developers have decided to 'force' players into choosing a character build and sticking with it for a playthrough by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-wont-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing the 'respec' feature</a>. Game Director Brandon Adler said:</p>



<p><em>Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>



<p>The game also suffered from a bit of a controversy when it went into pre-orders with a $79.99 pricing. After plenty of protests from fans, though, Microsoft relented and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-price-has-been-reduced-to-69-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverted the base price to $69.99</a>.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 29, making it the third title launched by Obsidian this year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> and Grounded 2. On PC, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and ray tracing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-gamescom-onl-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-ninja-debuts-new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-at-gamescom-onl-2025-ahead-of-october-launch.1274637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the games we knew would appear at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> was Ninja Gaiden 4, and developers Team Ninja and Platinum Games did not disappoint with an incredible look at some unseen gameplay at this year's showcase.</p>



<p>The trailer was as action-packed as veteran Ninja Gaiden fans might expect it to be, and unsurprisingly looks like the series return to the action-game scene could be one of the best action games in the last decade.</p>



<p>While the trailer was another strong showcase of the gameplay in Ninja Gaiden 4, it also delved more into the game's story, and the adventure you'll undertake as Yakumo and Ryu Hayabusa.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ninja Gaiden 4 - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zk3ktSn87o8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Out of all the announcements featured in Gamescom ONL 2025, this is easily one of the most high-octane showcases. It's a good thing that we already have an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">October 21, 2025</a>, release date to look forward to, as Xbox revealed the date this past June during Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>These kinds of trailers don't make the wait any easier though, since every new look at Ninja Gaiden 4 only increases the anticipation behind each day waiting for its upcoming launch.</p>



<p>At least if you're in attendance at Gamescom 2025 you'll be able to satisfy your anticipation somewhat, as attendees at the show can head over to the Xbox booth for a chance to play the game themselves during the rest of Gamescom week in Cologne.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, host Geoff Keighley brought on stage Fallout Prime Video producer Jonathan Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet alongside stars Ella Purnell (Lucy) and Aaron Maten (Maximus) to talk about the second season of the show.</p>



<p>Geneva Robertson-Dworet said that the production team was excited to take the characters to some of their favorite locations from Fallout: New Vegas. Ella Purnell, for her part, commented that Lucy will have a hard choice on her hands once she finds her father: whether to bring him back to the Vault for justice, or to deal with him with another, much harsher brand of justice - the wasteland's. Another interesting theme in Fallout Season 2 will be to find out how much the Ghoul (played by the excellent Walton Goggins) will influence Lucy and vice versa.</p>



<p>As for Aaron, he pointed out that Maximus always wanted to become a Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel, and now that he has accomplished that, he may be facing the 'be careful what you wish for' type of situation.</p>



<p>The Ghoul, or rather Cooper Howard, will also appear in his human version before the war as he unravels a conspiracy. Of course, the cast did not just come to talk; they also brought the teaser trailer for the second season of Fallout, which will air on Prime Video on December 17.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer literally just dropped and fans are already raving about the many references to Fallout: New Vegas. Only time will tell if this new season will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as successful as the first one</a>, but here's hoping.</p>

            <p>"<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been delayed again, this time until the second half of 2025," Edwin wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delay-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-yet-again-because-technical-quality-is-more-important-than-sticking-to-a-date">March</a> this year. Today I write: Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been given a full release date at tonight's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, along with a fresh trailer.</p>
<p>To this point, the tale of Bloodlines 2 has been one of fan swearing induced by delays that have been a seriously regular occurence. Originally worked on by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">Hardsuit Labs</a>, the game's current devs The Chinese Room have said they're going for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more of a spiritual successor</a> than straight sequel. As of that last delay earlier this year, they were also very keen not to release it in as buggy a form as another Paradox project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>.</p>

<p>That brings us to today, and Bloodlines 2's appearance at 2025's Gamescom Keighleyfest. It'll release on October 21st, The Chinese Room have revealed, narrowing down the previously given window to one date that's just about close enough to halloween.</p>
<p>You can check out the new trailer that revealed the new date above. As you'd imagine, it contains plenty of vampirey goodness, with the player literally exploding someone into a big blood splatter at one point by cheekily messing with their heart. As Fabien and Phyre, you'll be unravelling mysteries from the past and roaming modern day Seattle.</p><p>Everything keeps coming back to a tree surrounded by sunflowers in a field that's permanently coated in an eerie orange sunset hue, where someone's chilling out as they wait for Phyre. Hopefully Phyre's on time. Vampires, assuming this shadowy figure is one, can be sticklers for promptness, especially when dawn's nearing.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks pretty cool, speaking some someone who enjoyed The Chinese Room's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Scottish oil rig horror flick</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> last year. There don't look to be any Scottish vampires in Bloodlines 2, which is a little disappointing, but to be fair this is only a two-minute look at it. The real question, though, will be how well it matches up or doesn't with the expectations of the long-suffering crypt-dwellers who really dug their teeth into 	Troika Games' original Bloodlines. Especially given how much the vision behind it looks to have evolved as it's stalked through the night of a pretty tumultuous development.</p>
<p>We'll find out on October 21st, assuming no more delays are lurking down shadowy alleyways.</p>

            <p>Schoolgirl spookfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has gotten a fresh trailer during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, ahead of its release in September.</p>
<p>In case you're out of the loop, this trip to the quiet mounds is developed by Neobards Entertainment, and sees you take on the role of Shimizu Hinako. Your hometown's foggy and there are weird doll creatures cracking about the place, bit all is well because there's no emotional trauma you can't bash into sumbission with a metal implement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, the new trailer showed more of Hinako disvoering how her hometown's been turned on its head, and offered a first taste of Suzie Yeung providing the pipe-wielding protagonist's English voice. Aside from that, there was a mysterious bloke in a fox mask chatting about Hinako saving his soul, so he's going to repay the favout by reclaiming her old life. Plus, some wandering through a temple and Hinako's old home, armed with a nanigata, as you do.</p>
<p>The time to press f, and by that I mean the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-gets-a-release-date-plus-a-creepy-new-trailer-with-more-limb-cracking-noises-than-a-chiropractor-convention">release date</a>, is September 25. You're in for horrors like weapon degradation that ensures your naginata falls apart at the same rate Hinako's psyche probably will. Seriously though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-a-big-combat-focus-with-weapon-degradation-and-you-know-what-im-sure-itll-be-fine">more action-oriented combat</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-thing-thats-sold-me-most-on-silent-hill-f-so-far-is-its-slightly-outdated-ui">slightly outdated user interface</a>.</p><p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town, she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?" That's what Konami producer Motoi Okamoto wrote in a PlayStation blog post about Silent Hill uncapitalised sixth letter of the alphabet a few months ago.</p>
<p>Roll on September 25, and a trip to Ebisugaoka.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As one of Xbox’s 2025 lineup, Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2 continues the satirical capitalist space opera its original showcased. Now, as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, a new trailer for the upcoming game, recently price-cut, was shown off and gives us a bit more about companions, as well as new gameplay.</p>



<p>A sequel to the 2019 Bethesda/Obsidian RPG, The Outer Worlds 2 looks to be bigger and better than what came before. With a new story, characters, and planets to explore, it’s October 29th release can’t come soon enough for some. Luckily, we now have some new looks at gameplay, alongside the companions you’ll meet on your journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-arcadia-is-yours-to-explore-in-the-outer-worlds-2">Arcadia is Yours to Explore in The Outer Worlds 2</h2>

<iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2 Premium Edition Trailer 4K 60fps - GAMESCOM 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_rgl8haMqkQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer above, we get our first big look at companions, who’ll help you on your outer space quest. New faces like Tristian and Niles will aid you in combat and have exclusive quests in the story. The Outer Worlds had the same system, with the most popular of the bunch being Harvati, played by Ashly Burch. </p>



<p>The press surrounding The Outer Worlds 2 has been quite well, with many previews applauding <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first">the game’s evolution</a> from the original. Even more so, it looks to be even more in-depth with Perks/Flaws, gunplay, and the choice system. However, the title was priced at $80, which made some frustrated with Microsoft and Bethesda. Fortunately, due to backlash, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/">announced last month</a> that it would go down to $70.</p>



<p>With the title being a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, all of Obsidian’s 2025 titles can be played on the service. Those two, Grounded 2 (which is in early access) and Avowed, all received high praise upon release. Plus, given the original’s vast accolades for Game of the Year in 2019, there’s no doubt The Outer Worlds 2 is prepping to be another slam dunk for Obsidian and Bethesda.</p>



<p id="block-892b34ed-16c7-4b69-ad21-6c3142ed71da">Are you excited to play The Outer Worlds 2 when it comes out in October? Did you play the original, or are you going in for the first time? Let us know in the comments or on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">the Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p id="block-ea1e6263-b06f-4ea6-afe1-2430c5cda0ff">In our previous coverage of the game, we’ve talked about the controversial pricing situation, both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-game-director-says-they-arent-responsible-for-80-price/">before</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-cuts-prices-of-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-holiday-xbox-games/">after</a>.

<p>Each new Silent Hill f trailer becomes more uncomfortable to watch, and this means the game is doing its job. Gamescom 2025 gave us another look at Silent Hill f—the newest mainline release—and as you can imagine, you’ll have trouble sleeping tonight.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-announced-for-gamescom-2025-black-ops-7-hollow-knight-silksong-ea-fc-26-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Gamescom</a> games train is chugging along. Konami’s showing included a new look at Silent Hill f. Deemed beautiful and unsettling, the horror sequel moves to Japan, and the new trailer gives us a new glimpse into the unknown.</p>







<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, Hinako. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the trailer shown at Gamescom, Hinako’s distressing experience starts with a murder scene, with noise from a police scanner playing overhead. It’s followed by a mysterious stranger declaring their plans to take Hinako’s soul, with combat scene then shown against morbid figures.</p>



<p>Even more distressing, dialogue then plays telling Hinako it’s “time to say goodbye” and that she will “kill them with your own hands,” before a plea for her to “just die.” It’s certainly enough to keep you awake at night. </p>



<p>Konami has dropped the new trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill f</a>, which you can watch for yourself here.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Silent Hill f feels like a big departure from the Silent Hill 2 Remake in terms of setting and gameplay. Do you think the franchise needs to do this to evolve? Or should it have continued to stick to its pure Western horror roots? It’s an interesting debate, and one you can take to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Honor of Kings: World is a new open-world MMO by Tencent, and it just got an impressive new trailer at Gamescom 2025. </p>



<p>A vast game based on the MOBA of the same name, Honor of Kings: World is a new MMO for PC that will be set in a vast open world and aims to take on Final Fantasy XIV and World of Warcraft as the next big massively multiplayer adventure. </p>



<p>Like other games in the genre, Honor of Kings: World will be a class-driven experience where the heroes must go on a quest to save the world from a terrifying fallen god who’s hellbent on destruction. The game also received a brand new trailer at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/">Gamescom</a>, so let’s dig into it. </p>







<p>You can check out the new trailer below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer shows off the game’s impressive open world that looks set to rival some of the biggest we’ve ever seen in RPG or MMO games. </p>



<p>While <a href="https://honorofkingsworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Honor of Kings: World</a> faces stiff competition from more established MMOs such as Lost Ark, it’s based on an existing franchise that has a lot of players already on mobile, so it’s an exciting time to be a fan of the genre. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place immediately after the events of Ninja Gaiden 3, where the player will take the role of Yakumo. According to the developers, Yakumo was introduced to the series to make Ninja Gaiden more approachable for new players.

It will also be available via PC Game Pass. A full release will follow across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-984642"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via 11 bit studios:</p><blockquote><p>“Never a dull moment,” Will might say, now stranded in the mysterious village of Tresna and searching for a way home through an interdimensional mess—a quest demanding plenty of dodge rolling, fighting, looting, and clever shopkeeping along the way.</p><p>Much like Will’s long road back, crafting Moonlighter 2 into its final form takes time. The game is nearly complete, but a few parts of the adventure still need polishing. That’s why we’re inviting players to get an early taste of the journey through Early Access.</p><p>From day one, you’ll be able to dive into three biomes, each with unique enemies, and return with over  120 relics to sell in your shop. Set prices, serve customers, customize your space, and experience most of the story—all built around an updated combat system featuring four main weapons, nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks, and a smoother, improved feel.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will officially launch on October 21, co-publishers Paradox Interactive and White Wolf revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-games-and-trailers/2900-6888/" data-ref-id="2900-6888">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. In a new trailer, players also got a closer look at the game and how parts of the storyline will see them step into the shoes of Fabien--a mysterious Malkvian detective and the voice inside of the protagonist Phyre's mind--who'll help them unravel a murder mystery that threatens to alter Seattle's secret vampire society.</p><p>Alongside the standard release, there'll be two special editions that can be preordered. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Deluxe Edition comes bundled with Santa Monica Memories--a cosmetic pack featuring decor items inspired by the original Bloodlines game--to adorn Phyre's in-game apartment, and the Premium Edition includes that DLC and the DLC Shadows and Silk.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrAVDT7maJE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TrAVDT7maJE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This add-on allows enables players to choose the Lasombra or Toreador clans for Phyre to join, and each one offers unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits. This DLC will be available as standalone purchases for the standard edition of Bloodlines 2. Preorders will also include the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox, a decor item for Phyre's haven that features a curated playlist of in-game music by the composer of the first Bloodlines game, Rik Schaffer.</p><p>Bloodlines 2 arrives during a busy time on the gaming calendar, as the month includes several other big releases like Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6, and The Outer Worlds 2. For patient fans, the wait has been a long one, as Bloodlines 2 has had a rocky development cycle over the years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-lead-developers-replaced/1100-6487923/">The Chinese Room took over development from Hardsuit Labs in 2021</a>, and at one point, it looked like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/">Paradox was ready to pull the plug on the project</a>.</p><p>Since then, The Chinese Room has kept fans of the series updated with regular deep-dives into various facets of Bloodlines 2, like the vampire clans that you can align Phyre with, the movers and shakers in vampire city, and the penalties for breaking the Masquerade that keeps humans blissfully unaware of the bloodsuckers around them.</p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-all-these-years-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-an-actual-proper-release-date">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 finally gets a release date it looks like it will hit</a> - 21st October 2025 - so comes news you'll have to pay to access two of the six clans in the game. Clans here act like your character class, determining what kind of gameplay role your character will adopt, as well as giving you a sense of storied belonging in the world, so they're no trivial thing. And they're not cheap.</p>
<p>In order to access the Lasombra and Toreador clans, you'll need to buy the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which costs £18.69/€21.99/$21.99. And as far as I can tell, you won't be able to access these locked clans otherwise. If you don't pay, you'll only be able to access the default four: Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim and Ventrue.</p>
<p>There's a further gameplay consideration here. Clans modify the difficulty of the game by making you better or worse at certain things. In the preview build of Bloodlines 2 I've just been playing, I picked to be Brujah, which are a brawler-focused group. They are a normal difficulty clan to play as, whereas Ventrue - a clan that dominates minds - are easier, and the Banu Haqim, which revolve around stealthy ambush gameplay, are hard. There's more detail on the various clans on <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/about">the Bloodlines 2 website</a>, but there's not, frustratingly, any more information on Toreador or Lasombra.</p>
<p>However, Vampire: The Masquerade being a long-standing tabletop role-playing game means there's plenty of available information out there about these locked clans. The Lasombra clan is a shadowy organisation that manipulates through religion, apparently, whereas the Toreador are known for being seductive and enthralling, which is exactly the kind of vampire I'd like to be. It's a shame to have to pay for the privilege.</p><p>The Shadows and Silk add-on pack comes as part of the Premium Edition of the game, if you're willing to fork out £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 for it. It also contains the cosmetic Santa Monica Memories pack. But at the moment I suggest you wait. And I say that because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">I remain unconvinced after a few hours of play</a>.</p>
<p>This game has had a troubled development and it seems to me that in an effort to get it out, the developer has narrowed the scope and focused more on action gameplay rather than an intricate role-playing experience. That's not necessarily a bad thing - there's a terrific sense of speed and punch in what I played - but it does lack substance. I would wait for 21st October and see.</p>

            <p>Zero Parades has been announced, the next game by ZA/UM. That studio has undergone a drastic amount of staffing changes over the years, but it's the development studio that created <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>.</p>
<p>Described as an espionage RPG, you play as Hershel Wilk - or CASCADE - on a mysterious assignment. You'll need to make acquaintances of various people at the end of history, each with their own agendas.</p>
<p>On the Zero Parades' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">official Steam page</a> it's stated the game features a story of "failing forward", and "richly drawn characters". There's no release date for Zero Parades as of yet, but it's clear the game is trying to tap into that same distinct Disco Elysium style, even with many of the senior developers behind that award-winning game absent from the studio.</p>

            <p>
After a whole lot of waiting, the second season of Amazon Prime's acclaimed live-action Fallout adaptation finally has an air date. It hits the streaming service on 17th December, and the news is accompanied by a brand-new trailer offering some glimpses of what's in store, including a very familiar moustache.
</p>
<p>
Fallout Season 2, as we've long known, shifts the action to the post-apocalyptic remains of Las Vegas - as, of course, seen in fan-favourite game entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> - and judging by its latest trailer, there'll be more plenty switching between the past and present.
</p>
<p>
Returning cast members including Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Aaron Moten, and Kyle MachLachlan. And joining them in season two is the always welcome Justin Theroux, who is stepping into the role of Fallout: New Vegas' enigmatic (and elegantly moustached) ruler Robert House - a character who very briefly appeared in season one, albeit played by a different actor.
