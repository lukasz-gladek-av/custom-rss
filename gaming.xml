            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you want games that really experiment with ideas, and take concepts and mix them up, then the indie scene is the space in which that happens. From solo developers to small teams, indies have provided some of the most memorable, interesting, thought-provoking, and fun games over the years. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/20/game-of-the-year-2023-best-independent-game/">which won this award last year</a>. Now, we’re here to celebrate a new winner and there could really only have been one.</p>

<p>When it comes to taking something old and giving it a grand old shake up, Balatro has done it in style. Selling over 3.5 million copies, developer LocalThunk has taken poker and wrapped a roguelike experience around it that will really keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The concept of Balatro is so simple, and it keeps you hooked as you unlock more cards to use, slowly getting to grips with the different types available and learning how they will benefit you. Hours can be lost as you play through runs, building decks, collecting jokers, using arcane and planet cards for boosts, all to chase and play a hand that will satisfyingly score millions of points. You will also be looking at the collection of cards you have unlocked, wanting to complete the entire set, hoping a card you have not yet seen appears. This is as fun as poker can get, and all you’ll really lose is time.</p>
<h3>UFO 50 – Runner up</h3>
<p>It’s easy to look at a release like UFO 50 and assume it’s a selection of minigames with no long-term depth, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Each title in this massive omnibus ranges from a long-replayable arcade adventure to an hours-long RPG epic. As you dig into each of them, though, a wider story unfurls, and gives you cause to hunt for hidden details and buried easter eggs that add up to turn UFO 50 into an unparalleled game-design triumph and narrative-fueled easter egg hunt.</p>

<p>Some games in UFO 50 grabbed me more than others, but like chapters in a book or parts of a movie, even the weaker pieces of the puzzle contribute to a full experience that left my brain firing deep into the night, thinking about UFO 50 and how much I couldn’t wait to play it again.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h3>Crow Country – Runner up</h3>
<p>In a year with a host of fantastic indie horror games, Crow Country stands out as one of the best. The unique aesthetics look like an uncanny combination of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy VII at first glance, until you realise that you have full 3D camera control rather than the traditional fixed views. This in and of itself is enough to make the game stand out, but then you add in the excellent level design, some neat puzzles and satisfying gunplay to the mix.</p>
<p>The wonderfully Twin Peaks/X Files opening sees special agent Mara Forest investigating a mysterious rundown amusement park, the titular Crow Country, but the narrative soon spirals into something far more sinister and surprise filled. I’ve played a lot of indie games this year and Crow Country is one of the best and more than deserves its place amongst these end of year awards.</p>

            <p>The CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> studio Arrowhead has responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> crossover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-receives-first-ever-crossover-with-killzone-2-cosmetics">crossover with Sony's Killzone 2</a>, revealed yesterday, adds a number of themed items and cosmetics to the in-game store and is the first of its kind for the game. However, players have criticised their cost.</p>
<p>Usually, extra content is unlocked through a Warbond costing 1000 Super Credits (£7.99), which includes multiple weapons, armours, and cosmetic items. The Killzone 2 items are instead available to purchase separately, with all six items totalling 1,975 Super Credits - so two batches of 1000 Super Credits totalling £15.98, essentially doubling the price.</p>

<p>Separately, the StA-52 assault rifle costs 615 Super Credits (the most expensive item) and the AC-1 Dutiful armour costs 500 Super Credits.</p>
<p>Players have since responded negatively on the game's Discord server and reddit, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user posting</a> "615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous".</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt responded to a player on X who said the price "definitely felt steep".</p>
<p>"Sorry you felt the price was steep, we are looking at all feedback," Pilestedt replied. "The reason we changed it from a Warbond was actually because there were concerns that having a higher priced Warbond would carry negative sentiment."</p> <div>

<p>Over on Discord, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani responded (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/">PC Gamer</a>). "Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration so we'll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you'd like to see in the future," he said. "Secondly it's optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free."</p>
<p>He later added: "This was my way of saying that the better the game does the more stuff we can do."</p>
<p>Further, Jorjani noted while Arrowhead is partnered with Sony, pricing was the studio's decision. "This one is on us," he wrote.</p>

</span></p><p>As stated in the crossover announcement, the collaboration marks the start of a new five day rotation length in the store.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," Arrowhead said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-to-become-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawas-biggest-shareholder.1065213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-biggest-shareholder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has acquired more shares in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, which will make the Japanese gaming giant Kadokawa's biggest single shareholder (although it still doesn't have a majority stake).</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-become-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Sony has agreed to acquire over 12 million Kadokawa shares in January to the tune of about $318 million. This will give Sony a stake of around 10% in Kadokawa, making it the single largest shareholder in the company.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that as GI.biz points out, Sony already has a 14% stake in Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">purchased shares in the studio back in August 2022</a> alongside Chinese gaming monolith Tencent (which has a 16% stake in FromSoftware, but no stake in Kadokawa).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=hK0K9CiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-kadokawa-sony.jpg?itok=dIPkn9f0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa could be closer to an acquisition deal with Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the GI.biz report, the acquisition deal "goes beyond the sale of shares" and also includes plans for Sony to adapt Kadokawa IP into "live-action films and TV dramas", as well as an expansion of publishing and distribution for Kadokawa's games and anime.</p>

<p>This news comes just a few weeks after Kadokawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report" rel="nofollow">confirmed that it was in talks</a> for Sony to acquire it outright, but that no decision had been made as yet. This deal could see Sony moving one step closer towards that acquisition.</p>

<p>While Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, it's also the owner of companies like <i>Zero Escape&nbsp;</i>studio Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow"><em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=W4n1dMCy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/octopath-traveler-acquire-kadokawa.jpg?itok=d9cC1QRk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa also owns&nbsp;<em>Octopath Traveler&nbsp;</em>studio Acquire, among others.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, FromSoftware arguably remains Kadokawa's most well-known and successful subsidiary, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">sales of open-world action RPG&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Other recent successful Kadokawa releases include&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, another game published by Bandai Namco, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">topped three million sales in a single day</a> and which also recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen" rel="nofollow">received an update bringing split-screen multiplayer to all of its stages</a>.</p>

<p><em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>isn't the only Spike Chunsoft release to land in the last few weeks, either. Roguelike RPG&nbsp;<em>Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shiren-wanderer-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-pc" rel="nofollow">netted itself a PC release recently</a>, having netted itself 200,000 sales on Switch in Japan "quickly" after release.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Sony's acquisition of more shares in Kadokawa will eventually lead to an outright purchase. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornoby’s 1.1 update and patch notes represent the first major changes to the shooter. GSC Game World has made a ton of changes to Stalker 2 to its performance and fixing lingering key issues, and we have the full patch notes to check out.</p>



<p>The launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2</a> has been a resounding one, and successful enough to show the world wants more irradiated exploration. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-profitable-one-month-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2 was considered profitable</a> only one month after its debut, and GSC Game World has already been hard at work, trying to repair some of the title’s technical detractions.</p>



<p>Now, the Stalker 2 1.1 update delivers the biggest and most important fixes to date. Outside of headline-making improvements to A-Life, the 1.1 update for Stalker 2 brings with it a staggering <strong>1,800 improvements</strong>, distributed across gameplay, AI, missions, the general open world, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-stalker-2-dec-19-update-1-1-changes">Biggest STALKER 2 Dec. 19 Update 1.1 Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-a-life-is-alive-and-well">A-Life is Alive and Well</h3>



<p>It’s no secret A-Life has been a bit buggy and somewhat irrational since launch. Stalker 2’s 1.1 update should make this less of an issue though as the patch notes fix a variety of A-Life issues: NPC interactions feel more natural, they should be more frequent, and better optimization for NPCs in offline mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-amp-balancing">AI &amp; Balancing</h3>



<p>Stalker 2 suffers from a lot of problems many games have at launch: Issues pop up that didn’t in testing, and certain aspects need appropriate buffs and nerfs. A bunch of animations and AI behavioral patterns have been amended in the Stalker 2 1.1 update, whereas rewards, item values, abilities, ammo distribution, and weapon attachments have all been tinkered with in the full patch notes.</p>



<h3 id="h-missions-were-a-main-mission">Missions Were a Main Mission</h3>



<p>A ton of missions and side quests have been addressed in the 1.1 update for Stalker 2. The tweaks include missing characters vital to the progression of quests now being present, misbehaving mission markers, absent cutscenes, and a whole host of other improvements designed to keep progression smooth.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-list-of-stalker-2-update-1-1-fixes-amp-improvements">Complete list of STALKER 2 Update 1.1 Fixes &amp; Improvements</h2>

However, he says Sega has been improperly claiming it is the actual owner of the song and behaving as such, including licensing the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Gioeli's suit claims that Sega is basing its ownership of Live and Learn off "a 2001 lyric agreement where Gioeli was paid $3000 to write lyrics for a as-yet-untitled song that would be included in Sonic Adventure 2." He did so at his home studio, using his own equipment and own vocals, allegedly without Sega's direct involvement. He did work with Sega composer Jun Senoue over the phone, with Senoue initially sending him a music demo that Gioeli was supposed to write lyrics for. But the suit claims that the scope of Gioeli's work expanded over the course of his work on Live and Learn without amendment to the initial agreement, which was only for the lyrics. Allegedly, Gioeli revised the song significantly, communicating changes over the phone to Senoue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, Gioeli says Sega claims it owns both the recording and musical composition, but argues this is not actually the case and that there is no agreement stating such. And Gioeli also claims that Sega has acknowledged in the past that the composition is "likely jointly owned", with one Sega lawyer allegedly telling Gioeli at one point that he is entitled to 50% of profits from its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli allegedly was somehow unaware that Sega has been using Live and Learn with regularity in a number of other formats over the last 20 years. This is despite Gioeli working closely with the company on a number of songs throughout this time, all of which had far more specific agreements signed about who owned what. Per the suit, he only found out about its myriad uses through a fan telling him, and has since identified 25 video games it exists in. These include multiple Yakuza and Sonic games, Super Smash Bros, Phantasy Star Online, the maimai series, and Monster Hunter Rise). Notably, Gioeli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-3-will-feature-sonic-adventure-2s-beloved-song-live-and-learn-band-confirms">was involved in the song's inclusion in the recent movie Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> (which we've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba">just reviewed</a>), and even signed the deal with Paramount for song placement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli is seeking a court decision as to the ownership of Live and Learn, as well as a restitution for any money he is owed and damages for breach of the 2001 Lyric Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

High on the surprise release of their highly acclaimed 2023 hit Hi-Fi Rush, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1734595482633524&amp;usg=AOvVaw3eYxpmlBQUvMj2RthQ0_EN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the studio was suddenly closed down in May</a>, causing uproar among game fans around the world. Then, in August, it was announced that South Korea’s PUBG publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton had reached an agreement to acquire Tango</a>, along with Hi-Fi Rush, granting the studio a new lease of life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid such dramatic twists and turns, Tango has retained many of its staff for this new iteration. IGN spoke with studio head Colin Mack, creative director / Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and development director / Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira about their plans for Tango Gameworks going forward.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/hfr1-1734592108151.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas. Photo by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-2-dev-wants-it-to-have-a-more-open-world-type-of-experience-new-owner-says">previous reports</a> that Hi-Fi Rush 2 is in development, Mack clarified that the team are still considering their options before they commit to a sequel. That is to say, the team had previously been working on a sequel at the time of the acquisition, and it seems pretty likely that they will continue to do so, but at this stage a sequel is not guaranteed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are considering a sequel positively,” Mack told IGN. “We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, ‘This is what we're going to do.' ”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas added: “Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options. We’re currently at the stage of considering various opportunities.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From The Evil Within to Ghostwire: Tokyo and finally Hi-Fi Rush, Tango Gameworks is known for creating brand new games, and it seems that this culture still persists in the studio’s latest incarnation under Krafton. Egashira explained that creating new experiences is “in the DNA of Tango Gameworks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated,” he said. “I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the center, without losing our passion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not only me, but many of the development staff have a strong attachment to Hi-Fi Rush,” said Johanas. “Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the other hand, it's important to try new things. I worked on The Evil Within, directed its DLC, and then directed the sequel The Evil Within 2. I don't think I could have made yet another horror game at that point, because there’s only so much you can do with the same material. It’s risky to try something completely different, sure — but I think a sequel to a series is also a risk in itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton’s acquisition of Tango Gameworks came about when the studio members, faced with imminent closure, began looking for a buyer. Krafton was proactive in courting the team and moved extremely quickly to propose and finalize the acquisition, allowing many of the staff to stay together. “I’m glad that we were able to continue making games together while keeping the DNA of Tango Gameworks intact, rather than starting from scratch again,” said Johanas, highlighting how the team’s chemistry was built up over years of working together, and played a big part in the success of Hi-Fi Rush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio currently has around 50 employees, and Mack says they will begin recruitment in late December or January 2025, with a view to growing to around 100 people. This will allow them to focus on making one game at a time while also experimenting with new projects on the side, much like how Hi-Fi Rush was initially created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas also recalled advice given to him by Shinji Mikami, the legendary developer who founded Tango Gameworks in 2010 before leaving in 2023 after the release of Hi-Fi Rush. Mikami was keen to foster new talent at Tango, and Johanas essentially became one of his apprentices, influencing his views on how the studio will continue into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I learned from Mr Mikami that it is important for a director to discuss ideas for a game with their team rather than giving orders, and to make the game together,” Johanas said. “He often said that if you make a game like a bonsai tree, it may take the shape the director had in mind, but each of the development staff will not feel their output is reflected. In that sense, freedom is very important. Of course, it is necessary for the director to decide the overall direction, but we have always valued an environment where the staff can create freely, rather than one where they are only allowed to as they are told. It's closer to the growth of a tree in nature than a bonsai tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mikami places a high level of trust in his staff, which is why so many of us have stayed at Tango Gameworks for so long. I hope to continue this culture of freedom in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For information on recruitment at Tango Gameworks, check out </em><a href="https://www.krafton.com/ja/careers/jobs/?var_page=1&amp;search_list_cnt=10&amp;search_studio=TangoGameworks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Krafton’s recruitment site</em></u></a><em>. </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Chinese megacorp Tencent is next in-line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa and Sony have formed what the pair described as a ‘Strategic Capital and Business Alliance,’ with the goal to boost Kadokawa’s long list of intellectual properties globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of the deal includes vague corporate speak about how the two companies plan to work together in the future, but there is a line about adapting Kadokawa’s IP into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-producing anime works, and further expanding the publishing of Kadokawa’s games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That line in particular has already sparked speculation that Sony may help realise a live-action Elden Ring movie or TV series of some kind, but it’s worth pointing out that much of Sony’s interest in Kadokawa has to do with its anime business, as opposed to its video game business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki commented: "Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims">financial experts said the PlayStation maker might have been put off the deal due to the cost of having to acquire all of Kadokawa</a>, rather than the parts it was actually interested in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa was reportedly only interested in doing a deal with Sony if it bought the entire company. Sony, however, was reportedly only interested in “extracting” assets related to anime and video games, which presumably included the developer of Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying all of Kadokawa would cost 640 billion yen (approx $4.3 billion), according to expert estimates. Sony’s cash for buyouts is apparently tight at the moment due to investments made elsewhere. As a point of comparison, Sony bought Destiny developer Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022. The studio has since suffered multiple rounds of layoffs and project cancelations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the apparent prospect of a bidding war, or scope for Sony to buy 50% of Kadokawa and turn it into a subsidiary it doesn’t wholly own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa’s business extends into areas that fit into Sony’s broader entertainment offering, which includes anime, manga, TV, and film. Kadokawa is a prolific publisher of anime, and Sony already owns anime streamers Crunchyroll and Funimation. As well as FromSoftware, Kadokawa owns Danganronpa developer Spike Chunsoft, Octopath Traveler developer Acquire, and RPG Maker and Pixel Game Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games. Kadokawa is the majority owner of FromSoftware, with around 70% of the company. Sony already owns around 14% of the developer, with Tencent owning around 16%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Sony, its gaming business has already suffered significant layoffs this year and the closure of multiple studios, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord"><u>Concord developer Firewalk</u></a>. In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>it announced a round of layoffs</u></a> affecting 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs impacted a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite, but PlayStation's London studio was hit hardest with a notice of closure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for FromSoftware, it's working on multiplatform Elden Ring spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which is due out next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em><em> A previous version of this story claimed Sony had become the majority shareholder of Kadokawa, when in fact it has become the largest.

            <p>Crush 40 musician and Sonic songwriter Johnny Gioeli is suing Sega of America over ownership of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> theme song Live and Learn.</p>
<p>Gioeli has claimed Sega only has rights to the lyrics of the song and not the "master recording and musical composition", the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/806228650/Live-and-Learn-lawsuit-via-Polygon">lawsuit</a> reads (as shared by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/498953/sonic-music-live-and-learn-copyright-lawsuit-crush-40-sega">Polygon</a>), but "unbeknownst" to the songwriter Sega has "exploited and licensed" the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films".</p>
<p>Live and Learn features heavily in the latest film, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, though Gioeli previously confirmed to <a href="https://aftermath.site/sonic-movie-live-and-learn">Aftermath</a> a deal was signed for its use with Paramount.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Gioeli claims he was paid $3000 to write lyrics for an as-yet-untitled song to be included in Sonic Adventure 2. He then "ended up arranging, producing, recording, and performing vocals on Live and Learn, which was produced out of his home studio in California using his own equipment without the supervision, control, or involvement" of Sega.</p>
<p>Further, Sega's assertion it owns full control over the master recording and music composition is "without basis" as there is no agreement in place with Gioeli to transfer rights beyond the lyrics.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gioeli has "maintained his songwriting registration" for the song for over 20 years. The songwriter holds the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721">copyright</a> for Live and Learn, where he's listed as having authorship over the music and lyrics. The date of this registration is 2024.</p><p>Gioeli does admit the "composition is likely jointly owned", the lawsuit reads, and is therefore seeking a Court decision to determine the ownership of the song. The writer is also seeking $500,000 in damages, and a further $500,000 in restitution.</p>
<p>Gioeli has worked with Sega composer Jun Senoue on multiple Sonic soundtracks, together writing and performing under the name Sons of Angels, which was later changed to Crush 40.</p>
<p>While his work on Live and Learn was "expressly limited in scope to lyrics" as per his agreement with Sega, Gioeli received demos of instrumental portions from Senoue and a back and forth ensued with Gioeli's input.</p>
<p>Gioeli "controlled and oversaw the recording process, produced the recording, directed the arrangement and of the song, directed the recording process for other musicians, and recorded and performed the vocals", the lawsuit reads.</p>
<p>Gioeli worked with Sega for over 20 years, from 1998's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-sonic-at-olympic-games-tokyo-2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the lawsuit states he was made aware by a fan of Crush 40 that Live and Learn was present in other well-known games, including the likes of Sonic Generations, multiple Yakuza games, multiple Super Smash Bros. games, and the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>"I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega," Gioeli told Polygon. "I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sega for further comment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> releases this week, capping off Sega's Year of Shadow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster project mod is now available for download, introducing further visual improvements to the PlayStation 4 exclusive which has become fully playable on PC this year thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator.</p>
<p>The 0.8 version of the mod introduces plenty of improvements over the previous release, such as more point lights, more parallax occlusion mapping, some reflectance map changes, and more. The new features introduced by the new version of the mod are explained in great detail by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, creator of the mod, in the video below. The mod can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>

<p>Having a playable PC version of Bloodborne has been a dream for soulslike fans for a very long time, and it has finally become a reality earlier this year, as mentioned above, thanks to the fast improvement of the ShadPS4 emulator over the past few months. Emulation still isn't 100% perfect, but things continue to improve steadily, and a recent update of the emulator addressed some of the most common issues with the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-reduced-vram-dynamic-shadows/">RAM usage spikes, excessive VRAM usage, and frequent crashing</a>. The reduction in VRAM usage is actually a rather significant improvement, as this should allow those with older GPUs to run the game better.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that has made Bloodborne playable on PC can be found on its official website.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today has been a day of announcements for Japanese publisher Nihon Falcom, who has revealed an updated version of Ys X as well as the release window and platforms for the previously announced Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, a remake of the first entry in the sprawling Trails series.</p>
<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the updated version of the tenth entry in the series, which was released only a few months ago in the West. This new version of the game will feature plenty of new features, including a new location, Aland Island, located to the north of Obelia Gulf, where Adol and Karja will meet another mysterious Mana user, learn new Mana Actions, and more. Together with the new story content, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature new bosses, Mana Ride races, and arena battles that will put players' skills to the test. The game has only been announced for Japan as of now and will launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>Besides announcing Ys X: Proud Nordics, Falcom revealed today that Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, which was revealed for Nintendo Switch earlier this year, will also launch on PC and PlayStation 5 during Fall 2025. The game will be published in the West by GungHo Online Entertainment, complete with English and Japanese voice-overs and English, Japanese, French, and German subtitles. A new trailer showcasing the overhauled visuals and combat system over the original was also released today, and you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd9j_NWZGG8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement of more platforms and a release window for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is very welcome, the announcement of Ys X: Proud Nordics so close to the Western release of the original version of the game is far less so, even though it is a completely enjoyable experience, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">review</a>. Hopefully, players won't need to purchase the game again to enjoy the new content, which sounds rather substantial.</p>

			<p>A new STALKER 2 major patch is now live on PC and Xbox consoles, bringing performance and optimization improvements, A-Life 2.0 enhancements, and more.</p>
<p>The massive 1.1 patch, which is a whopping 110 GB big, addresses over 1800 issues, including many of the issues that prevented the game's A-Life system from working properly in Offline, out of the player's visualization range. Plenty of AI "anomalies" were also fixed, and some balance adjustments were made, such as increased rewards for several missions, tweaked damage for PSY fields, and more.</p>
<p>The new STALKER 2 major patch also brings performance and optimization improvements. Largely populated areas of the map should run better in the new version of the game, and performance drops should no longer be an issue in a variety of scenarios and for those running the game on any RTX 3000 series card with AND FSR frame generation. You can check out the massive list of fixes introduced by the new patch by heading over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World, which has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-already-profitable-says-gsc-investor-and-it-might-be-adapted-to-netflix/">become profitable and could be adapted for a TV show</a>, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>

            <p>The developer of Catly has updated the game's Steam page with a proper gameplay trailer and screenshots, following allegations its game and trailer have been made with generative AI and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The trailer (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/">Steam</a> but not yet YouTube) shows various cats wandering through surreal natural environments, as well as customisation options for cat types and multiple outfits.</p>
<p>It also shows off the hyper-realistic fur in-game, which developer SuperAuthenti previously confirmed has been made in Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>Catly was first revealed at last week's The Game Awards, described as an "open-world adventure" where players build their dream island and care for cats through "dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more", according to the Steam page.</p><p>Further gameplay details have been added. An online mode will allow players to collaborate from around the world on their cat creations and complete challenges with island residents. There will be farming sim elements as well as island building, plus templates and tools to design personalised outfits, furniture, houses, and gardens.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/catly-developer-denies-using-generative-ai-or-blockchain-technology-in-its-open-world-cat-game">SuperAuthenti came under fire following the game's reveal</a> due to allegations it used generative AI for its game and trailer, as well as suspected links to blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The studio's co-founder, Kevin Yeung, also co-founded TenthPlanet - a studio reportedly working on two blockchain games. The Steam page also includes a testimonial from known web3 investor and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> producer Thomas Vu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-accessible-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">December is a big month for me. It’s a time to celebrate the holidays with friends and family, surprise loved ones with unique gifts, and attempt to reconnect with the ever-growing monstrosity that is my backlog. December is also a time for me to reflect on games that launched throughout the year – especially those that continued to demonstrate the rise in accessibility acceptance, as well as push the innovative boundary for future titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 was rife with accessible games, spanning across numerous genres and developed by various sized studios. As the industry’s understanding and implementation of features and designs continues to evolve, games are far more accessible than before. And with this year-end issue of Access Designed, IGN would like to recognize several games for their accessibility excellence. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguard-1734540157261.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bioware’s latest installment in its fantasy RPG series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, is the purest definition of normalizing and standardizing accessibility. Not only does it demonstrate the studio’s increased commitment to disabled players since Dragon Age: Inquisition’s release in 2014, but Veilguard’s accessibility offerings also impressively cater toward an array of disabilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visual features like subtitle adjustments, colorblind filters, and both melee and ranged threat indicators allow deaf and hard of hearing users to process gameplay information without audio. For blind and low vision players, Veilguard’s options offer audio indicators for incoming attacks, dialogue options, and interactive objects – all of which are crucial for combat, storytelling, and overworld traversal. Physically disabled players can remap controls, toggle options for mechanics like blocking, aiming, and holding inputs, and even remove QTEs and combos with rapid button presses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard’s greatest accessibility achievement, though, comes in the form of dynamic difficulty. Difficulty is not unanimous. Not only do the rules, methods and understanding of challenge vary between studios, individual games, and player experiences - the majority of difficulty settings only tackle enemy aggression, player damage output, and player health. But in Veilguard, disabled players can alter settings like enemy resistances, enemy vulnerability, timing windows for dodging and parrying, enemy health and aggression. You can even toggle player death, allowing you to remain alive no matter how much damage you take. Combine that with settings that allow players to continuously access previously learned information, have consistent waypoints for objectives and overworld items, and the capability to pause whenever you like, and disabled players are given the chance they need to process each encounter or recover stamina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard isn’t perfect. Some features like single stick movement and robust guidance systems are missing. Yet it still acts as the quintessential modern accessible experience. The industry continues to rightfully praise games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-the-new-gold-standard-for-accessibility">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, but Veilguard demonstrates it’s time to move beyond the notion that a single game deserves all the accessibility praise. Instead, accessibility is evolving across the industry, and Veilguard is one of this year’s prime examples.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-up: Botany Manor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-botany-manor-1734540172274.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a common misconception that accessibility can only be achieved by companies owned by wealthy megacorporations like Microsoft or Sony. This belief that accessibility requires dozens of developers and untold amounts of money continues to plague innovation. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/botany-manor-review">Botany Manor</a>, a low-budget puzzle game, is proof that such a belief is a fallacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Balloon Studios and published by Whitethorn Games, Botany Manor is a soothing puzzle solving game set in a stately home in 19th century England. This genre is, admittedly, not my favorite – I prefer action and turn-based RPGs. But the accessibility features and design of Botany Manor made this game an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. For starters, it offers full support for mouse and keyboard or controller, depending on your preferred setup. It also offers single stick gameplay, with an option to toggle the capability to look around. Finally, a toggle to sprint is also offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an admittedly small selection of options, but they’re augmented by Botany Manor’s impressive use of inclusive design. There are no time limits for solving puzzles; instead players are allowed to take as much time as needed to figure out ways to grow specific plants. Furthermore, puzzles are relegated to a select number of rooms per chapter. Rather than opening the entirety of the manor to players, which could feel overwhelming, those with physical and cognitive disabilities can preserve energy knowing puzzles are within sections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Botany Manor is by no means perfect, as blind and low vision players will undoubtedly struggle without specific audio-based options. But an indie studio that creates a game with such accessibility-focused attention to inclusive design should be rewarded for its efforts. Botany Manor is proof you don’t need an extensive budget nor dozens of options to make puzzle games accessible.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-1734540187355.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The winner of this year’s accessibility award is bittersweet. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> proved truly innovative for the Metroidvania genre. However, publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-moves-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-to-beyond-good-and-evil-2-the-next-ghost-recon-and-a-rayman-remake">Ubisoft recently disbanded the Montpellier-based development team</a> and assigned them across several new projects, meaning that a sequel or future innovations from the studio has very little chance of happening. But I’m not awarding developers because of pity. Rather, I’m awarding the team because they created the most innovatively accessible experience of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lost Crown offers customizable controls, subtitles, audio indicators for varying attacks, and a toggle that automatically unfreezes your character when frozen by a frost status effect. But these options ultimately pale in comparison to the innovative Memory Shards and Guided Mode features.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroidvania genre relies on extensive memorization and backtracking. Areas are meant to be explored numerous times throughout a playthrough, with each segment opening new layers on repeat visits as players acquire new tools or powers. <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/gameplay/article/using-memory-shards-in-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/000106473" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memory Shards</a> allow players to place a screenshot of a location on the overworld map, reminding them of hidden items or barriers to new routes that can only be accessed with yet-to-be-acquired skills or equipment. Spotted a power up at the beginning of a zone that’s inaccessible? Just place a Memory Shard on the map to remind you to return when you’ve progressed. This feature has been praised as a gameplay tool in general, but it is an incredibly helpful tool for players of all cognitive abilities.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To coincide with Memory Shards, Guided Mode shows players precisely where their next objective is, as well as highlights any upcoming barriers along the path. Combined, these two features dramatically reduce the chance of cognitive overload while still respecting the core feature of a Metroidvania – exploration. While guides and placeable hints are not new to gaming, Metroidvania games have always been dense and obscure and, as a result, cognitively inaccessible. That is until the release of The Lost Crown. This year’s Prince of Persia really is a game (and genre) changer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 continued the trend of improving accessible experiences for disabled players. No longer are we expected to follow specific studios for accessible games. From AAA to indie, disabled players are no longer confined to specific genres because of accessibility offerings. And while barriers still exist, 2024 is indicative of increasing support from studios that continuously adopt the best accessibility practices. Some shortcomings aside, 2024 was as accessible as ever, and another fantastic year for disabled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.

            <p>Nintendo's next console will be called Switch 2, feature magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and could be announced in January.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, after speaking with a mystery reddit leaker who claimed to have got their hands on a final version of the Switch 2 console and its dock.</p>
<p>The internet has been inundated with possible leaks of the new console recently, most notably from case manufacturer <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/nintendo-switch-2-cases">Dbrand</a> and a reddit user called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">NextHandheld</a> who The Verge has since spoken with. "I've now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit," the report reads.</p>

<p>NextHandheld was able to show The Verge two photos of a possible Switch 2 dock and one of the inside of a possible controller rail (with certification logos and copper contacts exposed), which also shows a metal U-shaped kickstand.</p>
<p>The dock featured the same logo as the Nintendo Switch but with a 2 included, seemingly confirming Switch 2 will be the official name. NextHandheld's source claims an announcement to reveal the console will be made in January.</p>
<p>The controller rail image proves a rumour the Joy-Con controllers will attach magnetically to the console, with NextHandheld claiming there's a physical magnetic click when attached. A larger button will then release the controllers.</p>
<p>Further, NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don't contain the deteriorating sensor material of the current Switch model and can be recalibrated easily. Essentially, this could mean the end of Joy-Con drift.</p>
<p>Lastly, NextHandheld claims the Switch 2 will launch in dark grey, with a white version to follow along with a model based on a Nintendo game yet to receive a themed Switch. However, they admit to not being able to turn on the console or play games, so there's plenty we still don't know.</p>
<p>For instance, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Nintendo has officially confirmed backwards compatibility</a> for the new console, we don't know if this will be via physical cartridges or digital-only.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">Switch 2 accessories were already made available</a> at the start of the month via Chinese sellers, while accessories manufacturer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">Satisfye removed a trailer</a> showing the blurry outlines of the console.</p>
<p>At the least, it's clear we're edging ever closer to a full reveal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana (former NPD) Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3ldljjx7lak2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in a BlueSky post that the Nintendo Switch has surpassed PlayStation 2's lifetime console sales in the United States.</p>
<p>It's undoubtedly a huge milestone. To this date, the PlayStation 2 remains the best-selling console of all time, with around 160 million units sold, although that's a global figure. In the United States, the PlayStation 2 has sold 53 million units, which means the Nintendo Switch is now slightly over that number. There's actually another console that sold even more: the Nintendo DS, with its 57 million units. However, the DS was a handheld-only console, whereas the Switch is a hybrid console, making it directly comparable with the PS2.</p>
<p>Globally, the Nintendo Switch is still a bit far from the PS2. Around three months ago, we learned that the hybrid hardware had sold 146 million units, and its sales have been slowing down over the past year or so. With the Switch 2 about to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it's unlikely the original will be able to gather enough momentum to push past the PlayStation 2 and sit on the throne of all-time console sales.</p>
<p>Even so, it remains a smashing success for Nintendo, and it wasn't at all a given. Looking at Nintendo's history, they've gone from successful consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (which sold 61.91 million and 49.1 million units, respectively) to much less fortunate projects, like the Nintendo 64 (32 million units) and the GameCube (21.74 million consoles). The Wii returned Nintendo to its glory days and broke the milestone of a hundred million consoles sold, partly thanks to the motion control fad. But then the Wii U was another big flop, selling only 13.5 million units, the lowest ever for Nintendo.</p>
<p>It's hard to gauge what will happen with the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2, although the fact that it's rumored to carry over the same concepts as the Switch makes fans hopeful it will be another success story. Analysts are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bullish</a> about it, that's for sure.</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been rumoured for a while that Sony are about to buy Kadokawa Corporation, a monolithic Japanese media conglomerate that means nothing to the bulk of you unless I append the magic words "parent company of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> developers FromSoftware" and possibly also, "parent company of Spike Chunsoft". Sony and Kadokawa were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-is-in-talks-to-buy-dark-souls-and-elden-ring-parent-company-kadokawa">reported to be in talks last month</a>, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... "a strategic capital and business alliance agreement". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Under the terms of the deal, Sony will acquire 12,054,100 new shares in Kadokawa totalling 50 billion yen by 7th January 2025. Together with the Kadokawa shares they already own, this will make them Kadokawa's largest shareholder, with around 10% of Kadokawa shares overall. So, not quite an acquisition, then. But it does give them a lot of say over Kadokawa's direction.
</p>
<p>
Kadokawa and Sony have collaborated on projects in the past. The agreement paves the way for more of that collaboration. According to <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/">an announcement release</a>, future team-ups might include "potential joint investments in the content field, joint discovery of new creators, and joint promotion of further media mixes of both companies' IP". More specifically, they're looking at "initiatives to adapt Kadokawa's IP into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works through the Sony Group, further expand publishing of Kadokawa's games, and develop human resources to promote and expand virtual production."
</p>
<p>
In short, they're going to adapt and sell each other's stuff worldwide, which could involve any number of games, but also, may apply predominantly to non-game works and especially anime. I'm a bit mystified by the phrase "develop human resources to promote and expand virtual production". On-set virtual production, I gather, is when you use LED panels as a backdrop during the making of a film or TV show, allowing computer-generated graphics to appear in real-time. I'm not clear whether the press release is referring to this, however.
</p><p>
Kadokawa CEO Takeshi Natsuno is cock-a-hoop about the agreement. "This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world," he observed, with a slap of his thighs and a twinkle in his eye. 
</p>
<p>
Sony group chief operational officer and chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki is similarly tickled. "By combining Kadokawa's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision,'" he enthused. Is it safe to scream now?
</p>
<p>
I can't speak to Kadokawa or Sony's recent handling of such things, as we've been more focussed on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">events in North America and Europe</a>, but the non-merger is presumably good news for sustainability in the short term, inasmuch as no Kadokawa or Sony developers will lose their jobs to post-acquisition "due diligence", aka cost-cutting. As of August, Kadokawa had <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/fromsoftware-and-spike-chunsoft-parent-company-kadokawa-has-26-new-games-in-development/">26 games in development</a>.

		<p>Sony has made a big investment in FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa, forming a new capital and business alliance through the acquisition by Sony of a 10% stake in the media conglomerate. This includes shares previously purchased by Sony in 2021.</p>
<p>Sony President, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said, “Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.'”</p>


<p>While all the buzz here is about Sony getting closer ties to FromSoftware – mainly because a prospective Bloodborne remaster has become something of an internet meme – Kadokawa’s media empire is much, much broader than that. In game development they are the parent to Acquire and Spike Chunsoft, they also have an array of Japanese film-making companies, from animation to post-production localisation, and a books and manga arm as well.</p>
<p>This will be as much about games as it is about extending Sony’s reach within anime and other media – Kadokawa holds over 100,000 IP that can be tapped in various ways. Sony already has a near monopoly on global anime distribution, thanks to buying both Funimation and Crunchyroll in the past decade and combining the two, but now seems to be looking to gain more of the means of production, as it were.</p>

<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/sony-kadokawa-fromsoftware-elden-ring-bloodborne/">rumours and public statements that Sony was exploring a wholesale acquisition of Kadokawa</a> – reports were that Kadokawa wanted either a complete buyout or for Sony to leave them alone,&nbsp;though it’s not clear whether those reports were a slight exaggeration of the actual negotiations or if they’ve compromised to this investment.</p>

<p>Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20241219_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> the formation of a strategic alliance with Kadokawa, taking over 10% of the company’s shares. As a result, Sony will become the company’s largest shareholder. The transaction, scheduled for January 7, will cost Sony approximately $320 million.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-acquisition">What about the acquisition?</h2>



<p>According to the statement, <strong>Sony Group does not intend to acquire any more shares after this move</strong>, which indicates that the Japanese company has given up on acquiring the conglomerate. At least for now.</p>



<p>The strategic alliance will also strengthen the two companies’ IPs. The two companies will sit down in the future to discuss the production of live-action adaptations of prominent IPs, co-produce anime, and expand the distribution of Kadokawa anime globally. In games, Sony is to become a publisher for some of Kadokawa’s games. FromSoftware’s next original IP could become a Sony second party game, for example.</p>



<p>Hiroki Totoki, Sony President and CFO, said:</p>



<p>“<em>Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of KADOKAWA, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining KADOKAWA’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize KADOKAWA’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.</em>’”</p>



<p>The move also helps protect Kadokawa from acquisitions by other companies. The company attempting a hostile takeover will need Sony to agree to sell its shares, which makes the process more difficult (and expensive).</p>

            <p>Sony has increased its shares in FromSoftware owner Kadokawa as the two companies agree to form a "strategic capital and business alliance".</p>
<p>Sony already held shares in the company, but with the increase it now holds approximately 10 percent of the company's shares to become its largest shareholder, though this is not a full acquisition as previously suspected.</p>
<p>The two companies will adapt Kadokawa IP into live-action film and TV dramas globally, co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, further expand publishing of Kadokawa's games, and develop human resources.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/">press release</a> from Sony reads: Kadokawa and Sony "intend to further strengthen [their] collaboration to maximise both companies' IP value globally and facilitate wider and deeper collaboration", joining forces for content, discovering new creators, and "media mixes of both companies' IP".</p>
<p>Sony has acquired 12,054,100 new shares in Kadokawa for approximately 50bn yen, around £251.7m. Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> holds 6.86 percent of shares compared to Sony's 10 percent.</p>
<p>Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing, meaning Sony globally will now be a strong force in the industry.</p>
<p>Further expanding Kadokawa's games is the exciting bit for players, though, with the potential for more Bloodborne and Demon's Souls games with Sony, as well as big screen adaptations of FromSoftware's games.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted FromSoftware for further comment.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony," said Kadokawa CEO Takeshi Natsuno. "This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximising the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market."</p><p>"Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime," said Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. "By combining Kadokawa's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa's 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision'."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony potentially acquiring Kadokawa</a> broke in November, from a report from Reuters. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa followed up to officially acknowledge Sony's takeover interest</a>, which Sony also later confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/employees-at-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-reportedly-thrilled-about-possible-sony-takeover">Employees at FromSoftware were reportedly "thrilled"</a> at the possibility of a Sony takeover, due to disappointment with current management's response to a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year.</p>
<p>In addition to its 14 percent stake in FromSoftware specifically, Sony has ownership of the Bloodborne and Demon's Souls franchises. FromSoftware owns the rights to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Sekiro.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, FromSoftware publisher Bandai Namco revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">Elden Ring has sold 28.6m copies</a>.</p>

			<p>Following the rumor that Sony would be interested in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring</a> FromSoftware's parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, the two companies have just <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20241219_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that they have entered a strategic capital and business alliance that will make Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa's stock. It's not the first time, as the companies <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> a similar announcement three years ago, but it sounds like they're getting tighter. Sony is investing roughly $320 million to acquire 12 million new shares of the Japanese multimedia company.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Sony and Kadokawa will collaborate on several projects, such as adapting the latter company's intellectual properties to live-action TV or cinema, co-producing new anime works, and expanding the publishing of Kadokawa's games.</p>
<p>Takeshi Natsuno, Chief Executive Officer of Kadokawa Corporation, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony. This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony’s support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid-to-long term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market.</em></p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki, President, COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>
<p><em>Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.</em></p>
<p>Non-PlayStation gamers have been wary that this could mean FromSoftware's games would become exclusive to Sony's consoles, but this is doubtful. In all likelihood, the main goal of this collaboration is to adapt Kadokawa's franchises to other media.</p>

<p>The bulk of new content comes in the form of Boss Rush Mode. Fight against the clock and slay <em>Mullet MadJack</em>'s various bosses and compete with global rankings for the highest score. Make it to the final boss of the Mode and you'll be met with a surprise: a character from <em>ULTRAKILL.</em></p>


<p>V2 from <em>ULTRAKILL</em> makes an appearance and you'll have to fight head-to-head against this extremely lethal machine. Fans of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> will recognize this as a punishing boss encounter, and the crossover makes for an exciting addition to <em>Mullet MadJack</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mullet MadJack</em> is a roguelite first-person shooter featuring fast gameplay. Players have only a handful of seconds to make it to the next floor. Recover precious time by slaying robobillionaires and save the love of your life. With a story-based Campaign mode as well as an endless Survival mode, Boss Rush will make a fine addition to the critically-acclaimed title.</p>



<p><em>ULTRAKILL </em>is an equally fast-paced shooter, with a brutal difficulty curve and plenty of style. Take control of a killer robot called V1 and literally bathe in the blood of your enemies to regain health. It's currently in Early Access and, while the official launch of <em>ULTRAKILL</em> is still up in the air, it's received quite a bit of buzz from fans with over 100,000 Steam reviews.</p>

			<p>There's a new mod called Prey Remastered Luma that all fans of Arkane Austin's massively underrated game should check out. It was made by Filippo Tarpini, the Remedy developer who already worked on the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-mod-developed-by-remedy-programmer-adds-native-hdr-full-ultrawide-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control HDR/DLSS</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-luma-native-hdr-mod-released-by-all-star-modding-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Luma HDR</a> mods (the latter with the help of a larger team).</p>
<p>Despite the naming, Prey Luma actually has more in common with the former mod. That's basically, it doesn't just HDR; it introduces a lot more, such as support for NVIDIA DLSS and GTAO (Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion), and improves many graphics features such as Screen Space Reflections, Anisotropic Filtering, dynamic shadows, and more. The whole Prey Luma changelog can be found below; the mod can be downloaded via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prey2017/mods/149/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added HDR output (scRGB 16bit) with (improved tonemappin and rework of all post-processing effects</li>
<li>Increased buffers quality in SDR and HDR, reducing banding</li>
<li>Improved the quality of dynamic shadow, especially from up close</li>
<li>Added a more modern Ambient Occlusion solution (GTAO); the original AO is also improved in quality</li>
<li>Improved Screen Space Reflections</li>
<li>Added DLSS Super Resolution (on Nvidia GPUs) (OptiScaler can be used to inject FSR 3) (this looks drastically better than the native TAA and has no noticeable ghosting)</li>
<li>Added RCAS sharpening after TAA (replacing the original basic sharpening implementation)</li>
<li>Improved all the native Anti Aliasing implementations (e.g., SMAA and TAA)</li>
<li>Improved Anisotropic Filtering (it was not set to 16x on all textures that would benefit from it)</li>
<li>Improved quality and look of sun shaft effects and lens "optic" effects (e.g., lens flare)</li>
<li>Improved Motion Blur quality and fixes multiple issues with its motion vectors</li>
<li>Improved Bloom quality and fixes multiple issues with its generation (e.g., it was trailing at the edge of the screen)</li>
<li>Improved Ultrawide Aspect Ratio support (Bloom, AO, SSR, Sun Shafts, Lens Optics, etc. did not scale properly with it, causing the sun to be huge in UW or causing bloom and chromatic aberration to be stretched). Prey now also exposes the vertical Field of View instead of the horizontal one, which was limited to 120 and not Ultrawide friendly.</li>
<li>Improved High Resolution support (a multitude of effects did not scale properly to 4K like the object highlight overlay or stars/sun sprites)</li>
<li>Improved Dynamic Resolution Scaling support (Film Grain, Bloom, TAA, AO, SSR, Sun Shafts, Lens Optics, and many other effects did not scale properly with it)</li>
<li>Improved High Frame Rate support by unlocking the frame rate beyond 144 (you can change the limit in the menu now)</li>
<li>Improved Swapchain flip model (more responsive for VRR)</li>
<li>Added optional HDR post-process filter on pre-rendered videos</li>
<li>Added settings to turn off Vignette or Camera Motion Blur</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, with Arkane Austin gone, the likelihood of a new Prey game in that vein seems very low. However, thanks to this mod, PC players will be able to continue playing this game with enhanced visuals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-actor-gta-6-release-role/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent interview uploaded to YouTube, Johnny Ray Gill, a veteran actor and performer who had roles in GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, makes a thinly veiled suggestion about his involvement in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>During the interview, the American actor and producer explained what he worked on when GTA 5 was in development, and then heavily referenced being involved in ‘another situation in that world that may be coming out in 2025, 2026.’</p>



<p>It’s easy to surmise that he’s talking about GTA 6, given his connections to Rockstar Games and GTA 5.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-slip-of-the-tongue">Slip of the Tongue</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has been one of the most locked-down titles since the leaks blew the lid off the project in 2022. In a sweep, more than 100 GB of content was pulled from Rockstar Games, revealing countless tidbits of information about the most highly-anticipated game ever made.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Rockstar Games published the first GTA 6 trailer, smashing viewership records and sending the world into a frenzy. By today, that’s still the only trailer that has been released. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with ‘Check It TV’ (picked up by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102238/gta-5-actor-hints-mysterious-role-in-grand-theft-auto-6-and-release-window/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>), Johnny Ray Gill appeared to talk about his work on Cross a hit television series, but the conversation turned to voiceover work and Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>Gill said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Grand Theft Auto was crazy. I was earlier in my career and they put the little helmet on you and they film you, and you’re doing multiple voices – different characters and stuff like that. I will say this…</p>



<p>Stay on the lookout. I can’t say anything, but there’s another situation happening in that world that may be coming out in 2025, 2026 that I’m really happy about.</p>



<p>I mean, I don’t know! I don’t know! Stay tuned.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the interviewer probed further, Gill said: ‘We will see, we will see…’</p>



<p>Here’s the moment in the interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GTA 6 Actor Announced?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoS71-3B2aM?start=1158&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Given that Gill’s profile has grown immeasurably since the launch of GTA 5 in 2013, he could be appearing in a much heavier role – but only time will tell how he surfaces in Rockstar Games’ next major project.</p>



<p>For now, the GTA 6 release window is holding firm as Fall 2025, and unless Gill has some inside knowledge that nobody else does, the mention of ‘2026’ was likely just conjecture.</p>

<p>Frostivus has landed in Dota 2, and until January 15, players will be able to enjoy a special event laden with gifts and rewards. In a new blog post published on the Dota 2 site, it was revealed that some massive steps have been taken to improve the game in the last week, including an enormous ban wave against cheaters and ‘smurfs’.</p>



<p>In case you’ve never heard the term, smurfs are experienced players who create new accounts to play against lower-ranked users, rewarding them with easier matches that aren’t representative of their skill level.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enormous-wave">Enormous Wave</h2>



<p>In the blog post, the team revealed that an end-of-year ban wave has washed over Dota 2, and in it, 65,594 smurf accounts were permanently banned.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ‘a significant number’ of griefers, cheaters, and other malicious operators were also banned from the popular MOBA title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>King Kringle broke his ban hammer off in some well-deserving asses last year. He’s spent the year constantly reforging and testing it on various smurfs and in-game baddies, and now he’s ready to rechristen it with the blood of the naughty.</p>



<p>While we usually do most of our bans and penalties behind the scenes, it’s become something of a Frostivus tradition for us to pull back the curtain a little bit and talk about this ongoing work. And so: This holiday season, we hope you look forward to some cleaner, friendlier, fairer games, free of the <strong>65,594 smurf accounts</strong> we’ve taken action against this week.</p>



<p>Besides the smurfs, we’ve also dropped the hammer on a significant number of high-MMR griefers, players who try to have fun at the expense of others, exploiting bugs, trading wins, and otherwise undermining the competitive challenge that is at the heart of every game of Dota.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From now until January 15, Dota 2 players worldwide are invited to participate in Frostivus, a limited-time event that yields massive rewards for the average user. The list of rewards includes the new ‘Spirit of Frostivus’ ability and access to the ‘Frostivus Forge’. </p>



<p>In the Winter 2024 Heroes’ Hoard, users can pick up a whopping 17 item sets.</p>



<p>Do you think Valve has a handle on the smurf issue in Dota 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our [intellectual property] and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term.

In addition, the Company has been continuously evaluating capital and business alliances and other partnerships that contribute to discontinuous growth as one measure in response to a global business environment in which IP is rapidly growing in importance.<br>In February 2021, the Company made a new share issuance through a third-party allotment to Sony, with the aim of strengthening the long-term relationship between the two companies. Through this third-party allotment, the Company has worked to enhance its IP “global media mix” by combining global development capabilities of Sony and its affiliates (hereinafter “Sony Group”) in animation and consumer gaming with the Company’s own content, while leveraging the strengths of both companies in terms of business and know-how. As a result of discussions with Sony, it was determined that further strengthening the capital alliance would reinforce and accelerate the “global media mix” strategy with a view to the global market including the construction of a business foundation that will create a more diverse range of IP, further strengthening of development, production and distribution of animation, video games and film, and acceleration of the Company’s ability to expand into merchandising products and music IP, and has entered into the Capital and Business Alliance Agreement with Sony.</li><li data-list-text="2.">Outline of the Capital and Business Alliance<ol><li data-list-text="(1)">Details of the Capital Alliance<br>The Company will issue new shares through a third-party allotment (12,054,100 shares of common stock; percentage of the total number of issued shares after the Third-Party Allotment: 7.83%), and Sony will subscribe for those shares.<br>In addition, Sony has agreed not to transfer the common stock of the Company to any third party for a period of one year from the date the Third-Party Allotment is implemented without the Company’s prior written consent.

In addition to planning and development of large-scale animated series and films, live-action films, drama series, and video games for the global market, and discovery of new creators through expansion of user-generated content (UGC) platforms, the Company also envisages acquiring the content holders including publishers, anime production companies, and game companies in Japan and overseas. At any rate, the Company may pursue multiple deals at the same time, allocating capital of anywhere from under 100 million yen to over 5 billion yen to each transaction, while also anticipating the possibility of engaging in collaborations with Sony Group. The Company believes it is necessary to raise the capital to provide strong financial backing to the IP creation capabilities of the Company which stem from its track record of creating an enriched and unique IPs comprising a diversified portfolio of books, films, anime, games and UGC platforms, and to ensure that it does not miss out on potential investment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that, between now and the end of March 2030, it will need to spend capital of 20 billion yen for the creation, development and acquisition of new IP. The Company will disclose more information regarding the specific use of capital once the details are finalized.</li><li data-list-text="(ii)">Enhancement of global IP distribution</li></ol></li></ol><p>Of the funds to be procured through the Third-Party Allotment, 29.7 billion yen will be allocated to the enhancement of global IP distribution. In order to globally distribute more of its abundant IP, including the new IP created through (i) above, and various media mix products developed based on that IP, especially in the large English-speaking and Chinese-speaking markets, the Company envisions developing overseas bases for manufacturing, distribution, and sales and making corporate acquisitions. In addition to this, the Company will work to build a foundation to expand the scope of video game publishing. At any rate, the Company may pursue multiple deals at the same time, allocating capital of anywhere from under 100 million yen to over 5 billion yen to each transaction, while also anticipating the possibility of using platforms owned by Sony Group. The Company believes it is necessary to raise the capital to provide strong financial backing to the IP creation capabilities of the Company which stem from its track record of multimedia deployment since the 1970s originating from its book- to-film adaptations and to ensure that it does not miss out on potential investment opportunities. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that, between now and the end of March 2030, it will need to spend capital of 29.7 billion yen to enhance global distribution of its IP. The Company will disclose more information regarding the specific use of capital once the details are finalized.</p></li><li data-list-text="4.">Rationale for Use of Capital<br>Appropriation of the funds procured through the Third-Party Allotment for the purposes stated in “(2) Specific Use of Procured Capital” in “3.

The price was determined after discussions with Sony as well as comprehensive consideration of factors such as the dilution that would occur as a result of the Third-Party Allotment, and the fact that the medium- to long-term corporate value and shareholder value are expected to increase as a result of the Third-Party Allotment and the Capital and Business Alliance.<br>Moreover, the price represents (i) 94.92% (a discount of 5.08%) of the simple average closing price of 4,368 yen (rounded to the nearest yen) of the Company’s common stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the one- month period (from November 19, 2024 to December 18, 2024) immediately preceding the board resolution date,<br>(ii) 114.50% (a premium of 14.50%) of the simple average closing price of 3,621 yen (rounded to the nearest yen) for the three-month period (from September 19, 2024 to December 18, 2024) immediately preceding the board resolution date, and (iii) 128.84% (a premium of 28.84%) of the simple average closing price of 3,218 yen (rounded to the nearest yen) for the six-month period (from June 19, 2024 to December 18, 2024) immediately preceding the board resolution date, and has been determined not to constitute favorable discounted pricing.<br>In addition, the Company’s Audit Committee (comprised of three outside directors) expressed the opinion that the issuance price is based on the market price, which objectively represents the value of the Company’s common stock, and complies with the “Rules Concerning Handling of Allotment of New Shares to Third Party, Etc.” issued by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and does not constitute favorable discounted pricing.</li><li data-list-text="(2)">Rationale for Issuance Quantity and Dilution</li></ol><p>The number of shares of the Company to be issued through the Third-Party Allotment is 12,054,100 shares (number of voting rights: 120,541), which is equivalent to 8.50% of the total 141,784,120 issued shares of common stock of the Company as of September 30, 2024 (8.91% of the total 1,352,559 voting rights; rounded off to two decimal places), which will result in a certain degree of dilution.<br>However, based on the expected increase in growth and profitability through the appropriation of the capital procured through the Third-Party Allotment as described in “(2) Specific Use of Procured Capital” in “3.

<p>At The Game Awards 2024, one trailer stood out from the pack because of how bizarre it looked. It was a showcase revealing ‘Catly’, a strange new game littered with cats that promises a range of activities in a wide-open world powered by feline companions, or something to that effect.</p>



<p>What became the talk of the town was how the trailer reeked of generative AI, and many expected it to be followed up with a reveal that the game was linked to the blockchain or NFTs.</p>



<p>In an interview, developers from SuperAuthenti, the team making Catly, revealed that isn’t the case.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-even-is-catly">What Even is Catly?</h2>



<p>Catly is nothing short of weird, and even the game’s description on Steam doesn’t help to clear things up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>An open-world adventure filled with surprises and joy, side by side with Cats! Build your dream island, meet various characters, and enjoy caring for your cats, dressing up, building, farming, racing, skiing, and much more! Explore freely and have endless fun with your furry companions!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a super-cute game that confused the 154 million viewers of The Game Awards. The trailer looked like something plucked straight out of a generative AI engine, but SuperAuthenti, the company making the game, assured IGN that isn’t what the deal is.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a>, a PR representative of SuperAuthenti said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(We are) very surprised by such speculations. We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They further advised that ‘zero blockchain technology’ has been incorporated into Catly, and also:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team walked IGN through the Catly trailer from a different perspective, reportedly revealing step-by-step how it was made, and uncovering the Unreal 5-powered technologies they used to create the ‘hyper-realistic cats’ featured in the initial trailer, which you can see below:</p>

</p><figcaption>Strange, right?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Catly doesn’t have a release date at present, and aside from the trailer and a few screenshots, not much is known about the title.</p>



<p>On Steam, it’s said that the game will promote ‘endless creativity’ in a ‘seamless open world’, and that the entire game is centred around adopting and raising cats. It looks like it could be a hotbed for microtransactions, so we’ll have to see what the game’s operating model looks like when it’s fleshed out a little more.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Catly? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
