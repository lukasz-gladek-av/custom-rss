But it’s not as simple as choosing and upgrading a structure to the maximum level. You need resources: Crops, Wood, Minerals, and Mon. You can find these resources in chests, camps, and from Port Vendors in settlements.</p><h2 id="h523721"><a id="upgrade"></a>Which hideout upgrades should you focus on first?</h2><figure id="" data-id="edc8d803da4d58e689bc902fa3231292" data-recommend-id="image://edc8d803da4d58e689bc902fa3231292" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hideout building upgrade screen in Assassin’s Creed Shadows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hideout building upgrade screen in Assassin’s Creed Shadows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="edc8d803da4d58e689bc902fa3231292" data-recommend-id="image://edc8d803da4d58e689bc902fa3231292" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hideout building upgrade screen in Assassin’s Creed Shadows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Between the Main Rooms and Themed Rooms in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>’ hideout, you’ll have plenty of upgrade options.

expansions like Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles. It also includes a Horse Armor Pack, meaning there is some free horse armor available.</p><p dir="ltr">Paid horse armor doesn't seem like that big of a deal (it isn't really), but it's mostly notable for just how unpopular Bethesda's original decision to sell $2 horse armor as DLC for Oblivion back in 2006 was. It was one of the first major microtransactions in a single player-game, and drew widespread attention and criticism from players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4480562-oblivionremastereddeluxeeditioncontents.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480562" data-ratio="1.1217532467532" data-width="616" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4480562-oblivionremastereddeluxeeditioncontents.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480562"></a><figcaption>A look at what's included as part of Oblivion Remastered's digital deluxe edition.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4480562-oblivionremastereddeluxeeditioncontents.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Nearly 20 years later in 2025, Oblivion's $2 horse armor seems quaint. Microtransactions are far more common, and over the years, players have simply accepted microtransactions being available in single player-titles, ranging from purely cosmetic upgrades to even being able to purchase consumable items or speed up progress for real cash.</p><p dir="ltr">In that light, the Oblivion Remastered deluxe edition-content feels less egregious than the original horse armor offered in 2006. Still, the decision by Bethesda to put new cosmetic horse armor behind a $10 upgrade is an interesting choice, and one it seems like Bethesda would have rather avoided rather than remind players of its past transgressions.</p><p dir="ltr">While Oblivion Remastered is out now, Bethesda's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-obviously-being-worked-on-amid-oblivions-remaster-todd-howard-says/1100-6531019/" data-ref-id="1100-6531019">Todd Howard reminded players it's still working on The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.

Though the company has experience with 3D action RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brings the fantasy world of the company's isometric Pillars of Eternity series to a massive 3D world. Like its predecessors, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/">Avowed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> allows players to make a dizzying number of decision in gameplay and dialogue that all intersect and shape their journey. Combine those branching choices with the game's advancements in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/what-obsidian-entertainment-learned-making-avowed-a-first-person-fantasy-game">first-person combat and animation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and you have an exceptionally complex game at risk of launching with a distressing number of bugs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that didn't happen. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/?utm=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250213">launched to critical acclaim,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with some critics noting the game isn't as "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/avowed-review-xbox-series-x/#dt-heading-the-beautiful-living-lands">glitchy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" as many of Obsidian's beloved older titles. The studio's reputation for buggy games was so noteworthy that at the 2025 Game Developers Conference, Obsidian QA lead David Benefield briefly mentioned it in his presentation on Obsidian's improvements to its QA workflow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What are those improvements? According to Benefield, Obsidian has spent the last decade (since the release of 2016's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362960/Tyranny/">Tyranny</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) restructuring its QA department to work more closely with the rest of the studio. QA testers became QA analysts, and instead of only running tests on builds of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the QA team began working with designers of all stripes to review their work in Obsidian's narrative tool and Unreal Engine, spotting bugs before anyone hit the "commit" button.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That process may sound dauting—but if you want to bolster your QA team, Benefield said you can boil the process down to one phrase: "train your QA team using whatever methods you're training your designers."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Obsidian's QA testers got access to ">Obsidian's QA testers got access to <span>Tyranny's </span>narrative tools</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The yearslong journey to reinvent Obsidian's QA department began in 2015 while developing the CRPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyranny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Dialogue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyranny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is accompanied by portraits of characters in different premade "poses" that illustrate their emotional state. Originally these poses were to be set up by the narrative team working in the Obsidian narrative tool, but according to Benefield, that team had become bogged down creating quests and content for the game, and work on implementing poses was falling behind schedule.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Implementing these poses wasn't a complex process, it just required hours and hours of work, and the QA team had the bandwidth to take up the task. But with access to the tool they began to realize there was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>loads</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of implemented content they'd never seen or tested before.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well" target="_self" data-discover="true">The scratch coding and sharp constraints at the heart of Animal Well</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We found lines that had never been tested, or, in some cases, lines you couldn't even reach as a player due to a bug," he said. "Sometimes they were entire quest branches, small and large, hidden inside these files that unless you stumbled into it as a player, or it was documented somewhere, you wouldn't know that it's even there, meaning...QA couldn't [log] the bug if we didn't know the bug was present."</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Benefield was a tester at the time, and while he was implementing poses, he spotted a potentially game-breaking bug tied to the game's reputation system. In the game's opening hours, players balance demands from different factions like "The Disfavored" and "The Scarlet Forest" to garner reputation, culminating in a scene that will cement their initial allegiance. The scene checks the player's reputation with each faction, which is calculated by numbers that go up or down depending on different choices. Whichever faction the player has a better reputation with will determine what scene plays out and how the game progresses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because Benefield was working in the narrative tool and could see the number values and narrative node pathways, he did the math and found it was possible for players to make a precise set of choices that would end with equal reputation values with each faction. This was not an intended outcome, and the player wouldn't be able to progress the story.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals" target="_self" data-discover="true">The technical magic behind Doctor Strange's portals in Marvel Rivals</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He showed the bug to his lead...who congratulated him on his initiative but said they couldn't file a ticket unless he reproduced it in a build. It took him two hours to test and retest his theory, and the fix took 30 seconds. "I found it personally frustrating to see I'd found such a high-severity bug, but the cost and time to reproduce it would prove to be greater than the time to fix it," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately, Obsidian listened to his feedback, and after this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyranny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> bumped the status of its QA testers up to QA analysts (increasing their pay as well) and created a process for analysts to review quest and dialogue node trees before they went into the build.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Expanding in-tool testing on ">Expanding in-tool testing on <span>Avowed</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Benefield took a few years away from Obsidian to work as a producer at Nexon, but was hired back at the company as a QA lead on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where he began more rigorously implementing this process. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s conversation nodes weren't larger or more complex than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyranny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but now the QA team also had to track animation, audio, and other gameplay bugs that came with first-person combat and animated conversations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using a sample conversation with a merchant from early in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that checks if a specific party member was present, Benefield showed three ways a mistake in the narrative tool could lead to a bug in the game. If a designer created a node where a "bark" (a line that occurs without dialogue UI) transitions into a full dialogue sequence, the conversation breaks. If a designer forgets to identify a speaker when setting up a node, or the speaker was deleted after the file was created, the conversation breaks. And if someone forgets to put a "red" talk node (that ends the conversation) at the end of their sequence, the conversation breaks. All three of these bugs came up "dozens" of times when making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and they're "much easier" to spot inside the tools than if they're reported from inside the game.</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the process of catching these bugs and other logic breaks, the testing team began to spot more advanced (Benefield called them "fun") scripting errors, spotting them in the game's data and flagging the narrative designer. This saved time for both teams since narrative designers now knew the root cause of a bug rather than being told the symptom. "It also saves QA time by finding more bugs-per-minute than in the same time they'd spend testing content in the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This process wasn't restricted to Obsidian's in-house testers—external testers from service provider QLOC were also given this level of access. Testers from both companies grew so proficient at working with the narrative tool that Benefield began thinking—what if they applied this process to Unreal Blueprints as well?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Obsidian's Unreal Engine designers embraced working with QA">Obsidian's Unreal Engine designers embraced working with QA</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After enough time with this new process (and a healthy holiday break), Benefield began drafting a pitch for the rest of the studio. "If the analysts know these tools so well, and they know the game so well, the only pieces they're missing are how triggers, trigger volumes, and blueprints work on the Unreal side," he argued. "So what if we got them that info too?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pitch triggered a bit of "imposter syndrome" in Benefield. When he first joined Obsidian, the company's org chart kept QA siloed away from the rest of the design team, and there wasn't a lot of professional overlap between the different ends of the company. There wasn't a mandated divide like you might find at other game studios (this was the tail end of an era where some companies forbade QA from ever speaking with teams outside their department), but it wasn't what you'd call a close relationship. Though the departments became closer over the years, the lingering specter of viewing QA as the grunts at the bottom of the organization was still there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately—and Benefield said this is one of his "favorite parts" of working at Obsidian—a number of designers quickly warmed up to the idea, and were willing to give it a shot. This led to the creation of the "joint analysis session," where testers and designers stepped through a quest while reviewing the flow of information in Unreal.</span></p><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As they go through, the designer calls out every trigger and script used on the quest, literally pulling them up on a shared screen for the analyst to see and ask questions," Benefield said. "We also record these so we can be very brief about our notes and really just focus on what's on screen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because QA is only ever seeing how it does play out, this gives [designers] an opportunity to say 'wait, that's what it should have been doing, I didn't realize that's a bug.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These meetings run for an hour (with multiple meetings scheduled if a quest takes longer). Sometimes bugs were so obvious they could be fixed on a call.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Bringing QA and design together improved morale">Bringing QA and design together improved morale</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Benefield, Obsidian's designers loved these sessions. Bugs were squashed, QA learned more about content they needed to test through conventional means, production continued more efficiently, and maybe most importantly, it was a major boost for morale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I didn't see this one coming, but it was very noticeable to everybody involved and everybody adjacent to these sessions," Benefield recalled. "Folks were enjoying them. [Designers] felt much better about their quests after they'd been beat on during a joint analysis session.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even after these sessions, designers and QA analysts were more comfortable reaching out to each other with questions and comments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Obsidian made a number of other improvements to the QA process during the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but all of them came back to the core practice of training testers on tools used by designers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though the team still used classic "black box" testing to check for bugs organically emerging in the game, this "white box" method brought joy and collaboration to what can be a grinding field in game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Benefield concluded, "By pairing the QA mindset of 'how do I get this to break' with the designer mindset of 'how do I get this to work,' we're allowing these people to work closely to each other, and we get a better product in a shorter amount of time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GDC and Game Developer are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>In the descriptions for those videos, though, Coincident acknowledged some of the reasons that Okuplok's level has been "deemed impossible to beat in one segment" on Ultra Violence difficulty. Even if you have a perfect strategy mapped out for each segment, "some of the later fights are a pure RNG grind," he wrote. "Losing multiple 5-hour-long [Ultra Violence] runs over and over again that late into the map would drive me insane."</p>

    <p>
      Coincident's strategy videos for the slaughter map highlight just how tough even the "easy" sections are to complete.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>The slaughter level's "wildly varying levels of difficulty between each fight" are "extremely frustrating as a challenge, especially when you die to a difficult fight, after having cleared several easy (and borderline boring) fights for 3 hours," Coincident continued in another video description. "Some consider that the only reason why no one has single-segmented Okuplok on UV yet is because no one even wants to try. I wouldn't be surprised."</p>
<h2>“It’s over!”</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, over the weekend, Coincident proved he was willing to try what he once considered an "impossible" task. His grueling, six-hour-long marathon isn't actually that fun to watch at many points. The occasional moments of intense, close-quarters combat are punctuated by long segments where Coincident circle-strafes endlessly around large hordes, waiting for enemies to hurt each other with incidental damage so he can conserve ammunition. He also kills many <a href="https://gamicus.fandom.com/wiki/Kiting">kited enemies</a> one by one in corridors or through small gaps to keep things as safe as possible.</p>
<p>Even if you're not willing to sit through six hours of that kind of meticulous gameplay, it can be thrilling to jump around the stream and revel in the portions where Coincident shows off some extremely precise, near-perfect dodging through arenas filled with projectiles and floors littered with pixelated corpses. The drama gets especially intense near the end, when Coincident's breathing becomes noticeably heavy before finishing the run with a flashy rocket to the face just as he hits the exit panel.</p>
<p>"Yes! Fuck yes!" Coincident exclaims after the run is finally over. "Okuplok is done! Done, done, done, done, done! ... Oh my god, what a ride, this was quite the ride... It's done, I don't have to run this again! It's over!"</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=outworld+station">Outworld Station</a> is a new building sim from developer and publisher Trickjump Games that's now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3242950/Outworld_Station/">Steam</a> in early access. Step into the role of station commander and build out your space station, mining pretty much whatever you can get your hands on that'll help you expand your enterprise.</p>
<p>You'll be able to construct wormholes and use the power of antimatter to fulfill your goals, while also managing attacks from aliens, which you can do through expanding your empire further and by teaming up with other players in the 4-player PvE co-op mode.</p>
<p>A gameplay trailer from Trickjump Games shows off the impressive visuals from Outworld Station, which you can check out below.</p>

<p>Outworld Station puts players into the Tau system, where you'll be able to explore a number of planets and search for alien artefacts that can help you upgrade your technology and improve your station to assert your dominance in the Tau system further.</p>
<p>Trickjump Games is a UK-based studio founded in 2017, and this is the studio's third full release. The studio's most recent project before Outworld Station was a third-person action game called ArcRunner, which launched in 2023. Outworld Station is the team's first foray into a more strategy-simulation type game.</p>

            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>? I never played the original one myself, just that crappy one Spore Creatures on the DS, but I've long appreciated what Spore was trying to do from afar. There's an almost whimsical macabre feeling to it, playing god and all that, leading a creature down the path of evolution. You don't see too many games like that these days, though today's a bit of an exception given the announcement of Voidling Bound, a monster-taming/ gene splicing game from a team made up of former Skylanders devs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I bring up Spore because while you do seem to collect up different critters, the titular Voidlings, a comparison to Pokemon doesn't really feel apt. There's no turn-based combat, it's all third-person and action-focused, not to mention the fact that you actually play as the Voidlings a majority of the time it looks like. The main concept of the world is that you're a Space Wrangler, and there's a nasty parasite that's threatening to kill off all life. So, naturally, you take to genetically modifying Voidlings to help you survive.

<p>
There's different evolutionary lines you can head down for different Voidlings, which is about Digimon-esque in nature I suppose, and they're customizable too, both stats-wise and looks-wise. I'm not entirely sold on their designs, good designs are kind of a make-or-break situation for me and monster-taming games, but the core concept sounds solid so it could be a good game to tinker around with.
</p>
<p>
That's mostly it on details for now, there's no release date to be found, though it's apparently due out in 2026. If it takes your fancy, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2004680/Voidling_Bound/">wishlist Voidling Bound on Steam</a>.

The new remaster features improved visuals, more voice actors, better combat, movement tweaks—you can sprint now!—and a bunch of small quality-of-life changes, too. And best of all, the remaster includes all the DLC and expansions released for <em>Oblivion</em>. That’s nice. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533970/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered__Deluxe_Upgrade/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533970/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered__Deluxe_Upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there is a $10 “Deluxe” DLC you can buy separately</a></span> (or as part of a bundle) that adds new quests, weapons, and hilariously, new horse armor. </p><p>Back in 2006, not long after launching <em>Oblivion</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-horse-armor-on-sale-for-twice-the-price-5193675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-horse-armor-on-sale-for-twice-the-price-5193675">Bethesda released a DLC pack for the RPG that added horse armor to the game</a></span>. This horse armor was worthless. Literally worthless. It was just cosmetic and didn’t make your horse tougher. Yet, Bethesda charged $3 for it. And the internet destroyed them for it. But hey, it was 2006! Devs and publishers were still figuring out what DLC was and how much to charge for it. </p><p>In the years since, publishers don’t sell skins for a few bucks. Things have changed. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">Now they all know that they can actually charge <em>a lot more</em></a></span> for cosmetic-only skins. In 2025, it’s cute to look back at horse armor in <em>Oblivion </em>and how angry people got now that publishers regularly sell skins for $10, $15 or even $20 a pop. </p><p>So I have to admit that I laughed when I saw that Bethesda is selling new horse armor for three times as much as it did back in the day. Sure, this deluxe pack comes with other goodies, too. But it is really funny to me that after 20 years, Bethesda has seemingly learned only one thing from the horse armor debacle of 2006: You can actually charge a lot more for this crap. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bethesda.net/en/article/4HJix0Dpayy0OVgZiTmlRW/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-launch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4HJix0Dpayy0OVgZiTmlRW/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a></span> is out now on Xbox, PS5, PC, and Game Pass Ultimate. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Play as Lambypoo and adventure through the broken land of Tuscany, either making friends and having them join your team or defeating enemies for their EXP in your efforts to save your cousins and reunite Tuscany…</p><p>Each journey through Tuscany is completely unique to the player at the wheel, and you’ll be awarded something called a Rhapsody each time you complete the game—a postcard which details your entire playthrough which you can trade cross-platform between friends! You’re tasked with reuniting Tuscany, but nobody is telling you how… do whatever you want!</p><p><strong>What Kind of Stuff is in This Game?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Tales of Tuscany</em> is a fast-paced, hilarious RPG where you control your own story. Build a team of misfits to take on bosses with and make choices that shape the world around you! Features include…</p><ul><li><strong>Befriend Every Enemy, and They’ll Join Your Team!</strong> – In <em>Tales of Tuscany</em>, you don’t have to defeat enemies for their EXP… if you’re clever, you can find a way to BEFRIEND them, and they’ll join your team—complete with their own stats, BURST skills, and personalities. Pretty much every enemy in this game can join your party, aside from some special bosses… You can even find shiny versions of them all, too!</li><li><strong>Varying Battle Mechanics… What Genre Even Is This?</strong> – Crucial battles throughout your journey will flip the battle mechanics upside down! You’ll find yourself carving pumpkins, surfing waves at the public pool, filling out paper work, and even stealing money from old people to progress through Tuscany!</li><li><strong>This Game is Hilarious</strong> – Look, I might be a little bit biased because I did make the game and now I’m writing this, but… This game seriously is pretty funny. It’s lighthearted, goofy, and not over the top with toilet humor or anything. It’s like a fine, tasteful sort of funny that leaves your soul feeling nice and gets your social battery all charged up.</li><li><strong>A Whole Button Dedicated to Going “Baaa”</strong> – It seems pretty funny and pointless, which it could be, but… Using the “Baaa” button allows you to interact with the overworld in new ways—destroy rocks for items and money, speak to NPC’s, blow up cars and shatter windows, this “Baaa” has powers greater than we will ever understand!</li><li><strong>Choose Your Own <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,223 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>!</strong> – Tuscany is left in a state of disarray… which is the perfect time to come in and make everything worse! You can actively choose to rebuild your Village and unlock epic upgrades such as the ability to defeat enemies in the overworld using your “Baaa,” changing Lambypoo’s color, and many more amenities—or, you can take advantage of the chaos and grab control of Tuscany through brute force… Your decisions small and large will all shape the world around you!</li><li><strong>Trade Collectibles Cross-Platform</strong> – Earn a postcard called a “Rhapsody” at the end of every unique playthrough that you can trade amongst your friends cross platform! These Rhapsodies are highly customizable, and contain all of your stats and decisions, plus an awesome photo that you get to take in-game!</li></ul><p><strong>Bla Bla Bla I’m a Sheep. Alright I Get That Part. What is Like, the Actual Story?</strong></p><p>The world of Tuscany was an ancient, undisturbed land until the evil wizard Thunder Goober shattered through the atmosphere from the realm of Elysium—he then struck Tuscany with a giant bolt of lightning, completely obliterating your home town and sending all of your cousins flying all over the map! The hole in the atmosphere also began leaking EXP particles, which when collected by Tuscanos makes them stronger, but also crazy!</p><p>Now, Lambypoo has the chance to travel around Tuscany and save every cousin, which will help to rebuild new facilities at The Village—but Thunder Goober may have an underlying reason for causing all of this mayhem… No spoilers, you have to play the game! Hehe got you</p><p><strong>Can You Explain the “Rhapsody” Part Again? (I Was on the Phone With My Mom, Sorry)</strong></p><p>Okay listen up buster—this game is a choose-your-own-adventure, which means you can choose your own adventure. You can choose to collect an obscene amount of EXP, just a little bit, or none at all—you can choose to help or harm many characters around the world for reasons of your own and circumvent issues in more ways than one… Through all of these choices, a visual recreation of your Tale (in Tuscany) is created for you to bring into the real world and use to share your experience with friends. <em>Tales of Tuscany</em> is not meant to just be a singe-player-game, but also serve as a communication tool to share your experiences and compare/contrast amongst your friends, and even trade valuable keepsakes if you really trust each other.</p><p><strong>Is This Game “Good” And / Or “Fun”?</strong></p><p>Yes it’s so good. You can join a multi level marketing scheme, roll around a spicy dung-beetle-ball, get a corporate job, blow up cars, shoot your friends out of cannons so they explode, and there’s even a public pool. I know I mentioned that before but seriously who doesn’t like the public pool it’s the best place on earth…</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Tales of Tuscany ► Premiere at Top Hat Studios Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHRNUcdA8o4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Casey Jones, as well as skins for three iconic villains of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, will hit the in-game shop later today.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games announced that all of this TMNT content will hit Fortnite when its shop update goes live on April 22 at 8 PM ET / 5 PM PT. This shop refresh brings TMNT's Casey Jones, Krang, Rocksteady, and Bebop, as well as their respective Lego Styles and TMNT instruments.</p><p dir="ltr">The iconic Turtle Van, also known as the Party Wagon, will arrive in both Fortnite and Rocket League shops.</p><p dir="ltr">TMNT's first crossover event added the turtles, April O'Neil, Splinter, and Shredder. This new TMNT event, however, expands the series' influence on Fortnite and is part of UEFN, enabling players to create their own Ninja Turtle-themed islands. Epic Games announced the latest update makes all TMNT skins fully compatible with the game's character, NPC spawner, and guard devices, meaning players can create custom behaviors, animations, and even full-blown cinematics with the turtles.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, today's update adds the new Dimension X Starter Island template, which showcases the Technodrome Prefab and features new landscape materials, VFX, and a space-inspired skybox. Epic says this island is a blank canvas with no built-in gameplay, so players have complete control over their TMNT island creations.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, a Star Wars event has been revealed for Chapter 6 Season 3, which kicks off on May 2.

Fans have <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-concord-best-hero-shooters-1851726774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dissected</a> how its free-to-play model, regular updates, and <a href="https://gamerant.com/marvel-rivals-mcu-skin-prices-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flashy-yet-pricey skins </a>have made the game feel like a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">derivative-yet-better iteration</a> of <em>Overwatch</em>’s formula, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without all the Blizzard baggage</a>. However, one overlooked aspect of its success among players, which also <a href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-patch-pharah-mercy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributed significantly to <em>Overwatch</em>’s staying power</a> among its fandom, is <em>Rivals</em>’ scope for virtually endless shipping.</p><p>A not-insignificant corner of the internet is deeply invested in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/marvel-rivals-fan-porn-rule-34-1235304254/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venom’s unexpected tenure as the game’s resident “Girthmaster,”</a> in a flood of not safe for work Source Filmmaker animations, fan art, and <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1905635996643041502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwing his generous symbiote ass in a circle</a> in the game proper. But the real wild card is how <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ multiverse concept has unlocked a new frontier for unlikely romances.</p><p>We’ve already <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-mel-langdon-shipping-fanfiction-fandom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waxed poetic about</a> the typical tradition of fans crafting stories around their favorite media, and how shipping characters based on their undeniable chemistry is just another delightful extension of that. But these pairings are a different beast: often called “<a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Crack_Ship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crack ships</a>,” a term stemming from the notion that someone must be “on crack” to dream up such a pairing, they’re typically characterized by wholly unexpected and bizarre romantic couplings. These romantic pairings involve characters who barely—if ever—interact with each other in their original stories.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Marvel comics already teeming with canon ships like Sue Storm and Mr. Fantastic, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ multiversal madness has produced crack ships that are strangely compelling because, somehow, no comic book reader or writer has galaxy-brained their way to these compelling match-ups before. What’s more, comic book fans are <a href="https://x.com/DukeOfGotham/status/1912286864439910662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting</a> to see what new pairings <em>Rivals</em> players, some of them having their first foray into the comic book universe through the game, come up with next. As Aftermath’s resident fandom whisperer and internet culture anthropologist, I couldn’t pass up the chance to spotlight some that are logical, out of pocket, and oddly compelling.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these ships are spurned by developer <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NetEase Games</a> through unique voice line interactions in the game’s match waiting room. A few standout examples include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK1dX4sm15Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venom confessing their crush on Scarlet Witch</a> or Groot delighting in being able to communicate with Emma Frost thanks to her telepathy, relishing in her not having to decipher the inflections of him saying his name. These interactions have spawned lukewarm ships, such as Human Torch and original game character Luna Show, due to their whole fire and ice theme; <a href="https://x.com/PoposhiRat/status/1890430807941992822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loki and Mantis</a> for their shared quirky outsider vibes; and Winter Soldier and Hawkeye for being old man yaoi. <a href="https://x.com/AztexArts/status/1874092450920464466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man</a>, <a href="https://x.com/smerfols/status/1899206596363997596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psylocke</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/nekitoototo/status/1891598968498336100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magik </a>are essentially a grab bag of pairings with just about anyone, with Parker being a laid-back guy who can gel with almost anyone, and the other two being the cool, calm, and collected <a href="https://the-dere-types.fandom.com/wiki/Kuudere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kudere</a> archetypes that heroes vie for attention from. One of the oddest pairings I’ve stumbled upon is between <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>’s <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/StarKnight?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star-Lord and Moon Knight</a>. I have no idea how this duo even came to be, but based on the fan art, they seem to be operating on a shared single brain cell—and honestly, it's made for a delightfully chaotic couple dynamic. Congratulations to them on whatever they have going on.&nbsp;</p><p>By far one of the most popular ships that is also fresh on the market is the pairing of Bruce Banner with Emma Frost. With a ship name EmmaBruce and an infinitely funnier nickname <a href="https://x.com/dremcclave/status/1912261214945542342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Twink Angst,”</a> the Emma Frost and normal purple-shirted science man ship is weirdly one of the fandom’s most compelling pairings yet. As the game’s resident Bayonetta-meets-Nico Robin, Emma Frost has been characterized as a nurturing hero <a href="https://x.com/wandasdoula/status/1908284693545443569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who mothers refugee mutants</a> of Krakoa and will <a href="https://x.com/EmmaFrostxoxo/status/1908393029863637071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eviscerate anyone who harms Jeff the Land Shark</a>. When you take that energy and mix it with a tired, worn-down Banner who just wants to snuggle up with her and rest, you’ve got a nuclear-grade ship on your hands. The ship, whose inception point appears to have spawned from Twitter artist <a href="https://x.com/Chosentragedy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chosentragedy</a>, has gotten so immensely popular over a month that Chosentragedy has gone about making a series of short comics where <a href="https://x.com/Chosentragedy/status/1913104798901035126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce introduces Emma to his nerdy hobbies</a> like playing <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> has become a vast playground of characters, with the promise of new additions every month, providing an ever-expanding canvas for players to mix and match together, fueling a surge of fan art that has far outpaced the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qETx3QOmEJk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Avengers</em>-era frenzy of the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. It’s pretty damn fantastic to see it revitalize the online comic book side of the internet.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom"><h3>Fine, I’ll Play Star Wars XCOM</h3></a><p>It's got permadeath, and that's enough for me</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

If you’ve tried playing the original <em>Oblivion</em> at all recently, you’ll no doubt be aware of how much the game has aged. Even mods and graphics settings on the PC version don’t always make up for the digital crud of time. Thankfully, that’s no longer a problem and we can all get back to sinking countless hours into this classic Bethesda joint.<br>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>That said, Virtuos has also made changes on that front. Most notably, today's announcement revealed that the remaster will have a completely overhauled leveling system, which is described as combining elements from <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Skyrim</em>.</p>
<p>That will be welcome news for many players. In many ways, <em>Oblivion</em> feels like a modern game, but its leveling system—which incentivizes players to delay leveling up to grind certain skills—was controversial even when it launched. It's not completely clear what the new one will look like, but this is likely a case where most fans will consider any change a good one.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the game that are a bit odd and anachronistic are still in place, though, like the persuasion system for conversations with NPCs. Oblivion's appeal is largely about its jazzy gameplay systems, so the team likely didn't want to compromise that too much. Lockpicking is the same as before, too.</p>
<p>On the presentation side, Virtuos has added a much more robust lighting system than before, and the game looks hyper-detailed. NPC faces and talking animations have been overhauled for the better, but there are still some wacky-looking people. (Would we really have it any other way?)</p>


<p>All told, the stream made it look like we're getting a promising new coat of paint on a game that made an enormous impact when it first arrived in 2006 but which was overshadowed by <em>Skyrim</em> a few years later.</p>
<p><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is still in development, and <em>Skyrim</em> was much closer in time to Oblivion than it is to today. So apart from <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, fans of the franchise have been experiencing a historic drought.</p>
<p>A remaster certainly isn't the same as a new game, but if Bethesda and Virtuos pulled it off, this release is sure to be popular.</p>
<p>The game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">PC (Steam)</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $50 today. It’s also on Game Pass.</p>

                <p>Though Bungie has already announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-reveal-announced-for-next-month/1100-6530898/" data-ref-id="1100-6530898">showcase</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>: The Edge of Fate which takes place on May 6, a new teaser trailer adds additional context and hints towards the future of the sci-fi shooter.</p><p>The Edge of Fate is the name of Destiny 2's next big content drop. Though it hasn't been confirmed, we can assume this is either the next expansion, or the summer 2025 major update. While we faced off against The Witness in The Final Shape, and dealt with the aftermath in the episodic content that followed, the Edge of Fate represents a new beginning for Guardians.</p><p>The teaser trailer shows a Guardian and their ship flying toward symbols from the Nine. The Nine, sometimes stylized as the IX, are a group associated with the Sol System--the system where all of Destiny's activities so far have taken place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4480405-watchthedestiny2_theedgeoffaterevealonmay6at9ampt.0-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480405" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4480405-watchthedestiny2_theedgeoffaterevealonmay6at9ampt.0-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480405"></a><figcaption>Clues to Destiny 2's future are seen in a new teaser trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4480405-watchthedestiny2_theedgeoffaterevealonmay6at9ampt.0-13screenshot.png"></figure><p>They also control Unknown Space, which so far we know nothing much about. However, in the top left corner of the teaser trailer, the word 'Kepler' appears to be seen, although it's missing the 'r' thanks to the framing of the video. In real-world terms, Kepler are planets outside of our solar system that were discovered by NASA's Kepler space telescope. (Thanks<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Reckerless" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> Reckerless</em></a> on YouTube).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4utXKvOpYM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k4utXKvOpYM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The 15 seen alongside it could refer to the 15th Kepler planet, also known as Kepler-15 b. The trailer also seems to show the word 'Chiago' upside down, but it's not immediately obvious what this could refer to. All of these hints certainly seem to suggest that Guardians might finally be preparing to enter a brand-new system.</p><p>It's not the only reference to the enigmatic space entities that Bungie has dropped recently, as there's a limited-time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-rite-of-the-nine-how-it-works-loot-and-rotations/1100-6530525/" data-ref-id="1100-6530525">Rite of the Nine event</a> taking place in-game until the launch of the next expansion.</p>
