			<p>Yesterday, a dev diary showcasing Assassin's Creed Shadows went<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-assassins-creed-shadows-dev-diary-featuring-gameplay-leaks-online/"> live on the IGN China website</a>. Since then, <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft has announced</a> that they are canceling their appearance at the Tokyo Game Show, which was due to take place from September 26 to September 29. In addition, Ubisoft has also canceled press previews of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows press previews were reportedly due to take place next week, with the embargo date being released during that time. However, they have since been canceled. It's not been confirmed as to why the press previews have been canceled, but it's a safe guess that it has something to do with the various leaks of Assassin's Creed Shadows appearing online, and the huge controversy that has gone along with them.</p>
<p>Regarding their appearance at the Tokyo Game Show, they've cited their reason as "various circumstances," which is a very broad and vague response as to why they are no longer showcasing at the exhibition. In addition to their appearance as an exhibitor at the Tokyo Game Show, they've also canceled the stream that was scheduled for September 26. Again, the reasons haven't been stated, but it's possible that it's due to the significant amount of criticism Assassin's Creed Shadows has been facing, with complaints citing that the game is an inaccurate representation of Japanese history and culture.</p>
<p>While the game is still expected to have a preview event at the end of September, it's unsure as to whether there will be any event showcasing the game at all this month. Ubisoft has had a rocky year financially, with their <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">share prices dropping significantly</a> and their revenue taking a huge hit with games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and XDefiant not quite performing the way they were hoping.</p>
<p>Additionally, their shareholders are pushing for them to restructure the company, and to hire a new CEO, which, so far, the changes have not happened. Whether they will go ahead remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Although they are no longer doing the live stream showcasing the game, Ubisoft has stated that the ongoing giveaway campaign will continue despite the fact that the broadcast is no longer going ahead.</p>
<p>There is already huge speculation as to whether Assassin's Creed Shadows will be delayed with all of the ongoing controversy and peculiar cancelations, but now it seems even more likely after they pulled out of the biggest Tokyo Game Show to date. Whether it will be severely delayed or it will just be a couple of weeks or months, remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/try-the-demo-for-top-down-undead-slayer-moon-watch-in-which-time-is-movement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A week ago, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/among-the-many-beauties-of-arco-is-that-its-a-secret-gentle-introduction-to-bullet-hell-shooting">belabouring the nuances of Arco</a>, I expressed a wish to play more bullet hell games with time freeze mechanics, the better to savour the intricacy of their projectile patterning. Now here's Moon Watch, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-ish pixelart shooter in which you have a watch that stops time when you stand still. Snug within that frozen instant, you're free to laugh in the gurning faces of the living dead while you idly choose and aim garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets.</p>

<p>At least, until you run out of energy for garlic grenades, stake launchers and bouncy ice comets. In a sadistic reversal of the premise - akin to offering a child a spoonful of pudding, only to swap it for a spoonful of disgusting, nutritious vegetables - energy for weapons must be restored by moving about. So when you're not laughing in the faces of the living dead, you'll be carefully kiting them and dodging their shrapnel, with one eye glued to the energy reservoirs in the bottom left.</p>
<p>Why is Moon Watch "Vampire Survivors-ish", rather than "Vampire Survivors-like"? Well, firstly because many of the abilities have to be manually aimed and fired using the mouse. And secondly, because the game is made up of distinct levels or arenas sprinkled across a roguelitey campaign path. Each arena asks you to hold out for a certain time, rather than being a continuous, upward spiral of enemy waves and unlockables - it's a bit reminiscent of Into The Breach, I guess.</p>
<p>The vampire swarms aside, similarities with Vampire Survivors include a choice of three unlocks when you level up. These are the usual mix of passive buffs and new weapons for your hand. You can get turrets, for instance, and throwable zombie bait, and a teleport dash. I'm sure you can figure out some way to combine these things.</p>
<p>What else is there to tell? Well, the starting character is some kind of warrior-nun who looks like the ogreish blonde girl from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUsnJ9jlwns">Hey Arnold!</a>, but doesn't seem nearly as ogreish. When you beat a level she does a victory twirl, even as the remaining zombos mob her position like pigeons spotting a dropped sandwich. I find this charmingly plucky. Also, developers The Jaspel are the same depraved, genre-muddling scientists wot did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a>.</p>
<p>Find the demo for Moon Watch on <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/moonwatch">Itch.io</a> with a full release to follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/">Steam</a> at some point in the tactically deferred future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sega held a Sonic Central stream today, September 24, to give updates on several ongoing projects within the series. If you missed the show, you can watch it below, but if you just want the highlights, we’ve got you covered.<br></p></div></div><div><p>The show started with updates on the Sonic mobile games, including the <em>Fall Guys</em>-esque party game <em>Sonic Rumble </em>(which looks to be in much better shape now than it seemed in its first trailer earlier this year), new characters in <em>Sonic Dash</em> and the mobile version of <em>Sonic Forces</em>, and the announcement that they’re bringing Shadow to <em>Sonic Dream Team</em>. We are in the best timeline.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-recommend-id="image://622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="618" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic towers over a Dark Chao." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic towers over a Dark Chao." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-recommend-id="image://622c8555407339416444fe59a8cc8cab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="618" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic towers over a Dark Chao." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After a montage highlighting the <em>Sonic </em>in-person events over the past year, Sega announced <em>Chao Tales</em>, an eight-episode animated series that will follow Sonic as he visits a Chao garden and takes care of the weird little alien guys.<br></p></div><div><p>Next up, Sega spotlighted several crossover promotions between Sonic and other games. This includes a <em>Roblox</em> event that has you playing as Sonic and fighting Metal Sonic that is available now, new <em>Sonic</em>-themed skins in <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>, and <em>Sonic</em>-themed cosmetics for <em>Two-Point Museum</em> so you can create a museum that will teach the kids about the history that really matters, like Shadow’s sacrifice against the BioLizard in 2001's <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.</p></div><div><p>As we pivot from games to merchandise, we get an extended (and pretty funny) bit about the upcoming Sonic Lego packages. This includes sets featuring Shadow, Knuckles, Rouge, Sonic, Tails, and much more. Jakks Pacific is also making a new Shadow toy based on <em>Shadow Generations</em>, complete with weird Sephiroth wings. First 4 Figures also announced it is creating a new statue based on Shadow’s winged appearance in the game. Those are only a few of the many pieces of merchandise shown off during the show.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-recommend-id="image://900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1427" data-height="799" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic grinds on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic grinds on a rail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-recommend-id="image://900853da7e3d70f4db2a98b711d5bed3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1427" data-height="799" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic grinds on a rail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Topgolf, the gamified driving range, is adding a digital golf game based on <em>Sonic</em> in locations around the country. The game features Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy as playable characters who will move through obstacle courses based on your golf swings. It’s “coming soon.”<br></p></div><div><p>After a tease earlier this week, Sega has finally properly announced a Sonic and DC Comics crossover that initially showed Shadow dressed and acting as Batman. This will apparently be a long-term partnership between the two that’s kicking off with a five-part comic series starting in March 2025. The comics will be written by long-time <em>Sonic</em> writer Ian Flynn and feature Knuckles as Superman, Amy as Wonder Woman, Sonic as The Flash, Silver as Green Lantern, and Tails as Cyborg. The collaboration will extend throughout the year with merchandise in the fall, and more crossovers are planned for 2026.</p></div><div><p>Next we had a story trailer for <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, which put the spotlight on several villains Shadow will have to face again in the new storyline. We had already seen Black Doom from Shadow’s 2005 self-titled game, but we got our first look at Mephiles from <em>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</em>. It also looks like Shadow will see Maria Robotnik again after her death in his tragic backstory. Or a facscimile of her, at least. <em>Generations</em>’ whole deal is about reliving memories, and so if Shadow is going to retread his past, it only makes sense that he’d see her again when the game launches on October 25.</p></div><div><p>In the lead up to <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, Sega is rolling out the <em>Dark Beginnings</em> animated mini-series. This three-episode animated series will follow Shadow’s origin story and include appearances by his teammates Rouge the Bat and E-123 Omega. We saw some new footage featuring those characters and the whole thing looks pretty sick. The first episode will be released tomorrow, September 25, with the second and third to follow on October 3 and 10, respectively.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-recommend-id="image://01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1532" data-height="836" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Gerald Robotnik journal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Gerald Robotnik journal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-recommend-id="image://01b6308cd20316b697e2774dc23893d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1532" data-height="836" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Gerald Robotnik journal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Because the <em>Sonic </em>team loves a bit, they put together a retro commercial for the Gerald Robotnik journal that will be packaged in day-one physical copies of <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>. This artbook documents the creation of Shadow from the perspective of Doctor Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather and the mastermind behind the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. The commercial is tongue-in-cheek, but has some references to Gerald’s descent into madness revealed at the end of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. But the real important thing is that it’s the best look we’ve gotten at the book that will be included in those early copies, and it seems like it might reveal new truths about Shadow’s past fans have long speculated about.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d33c17cb10da04ad2f7f2b9d2288eb85" data-recommend-id="image://d33c17cb10da04ad2f7f2b9d2288eb85" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow jump in front of the third movie logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow jump in front of the third movie logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d33c17cb10da04ad2f7f2b9d2288eb85" data-recommend-id="image://d33c17cb10da04ad2f7f2b9d2288eb85" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow jump in front of the third movie logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wasn’t too surprising that we didn’t get much about <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3,</em> given they only just released the first trailer at the end of August. Instead of a new trailer, we just got a short hype piece with creatives from the films talking about how excited they are for the movie to premiere on December 20.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Diving into a video genre—for example, the strategy genre—can be challenging when you have little to no experience. On the surface, it appears easy enough. You click often, control units, or choose which buildings to construct. Simple, right? No, not always. Thankfully, monthly subscriptions like Xbox Game Pass are cost-effective for testing new games you might not usually play. With that said, can you play Frostpunk 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-frostpunk-2-on-game-pass">Is Frostpunk 2 on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, know that Frostpunk 2 is a rather challenging game. Even on its lowest difficulty setting, you’ll find that the constant, looming threat of freezing cold temperatures and a severe lack of food supplies can bring an untimely end to your colony. It’s now often a slow death, either. It’s fast-paced and unforgiving. Thankfully, you can play Frostpunk 2 on Xbox Game Pass, allowing ample time to test its mechanics and decide whether it’s worth adding to your library in earnest.</p>



<p>Frostpunk 2 launched on Game Pass on day one, alongside its retail release, ensuring everyone could play the game. Despite being on Game Pass, the game has sold hundreds of thousands of units already in its first week, making it a critical success for developer 11 bit studios!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-play-frostpunk-2">Where to Play Frostpunk 2</h2>



<p>Alongside being available on Xbox Game Pass, you can also play Frostpunk 2 on the following platforms and storefronts:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/frostpunk_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GOG</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/frostpunk-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a></li>



<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008442/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/frostpunk-2/9pn2k1lqn94d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Store</a></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll note that Frostpunk 2 is listed as “Announced ” on the PlayStation Store. It’s coming to PS5 at some point, but there’s no official word on precisely when which likely has something to do with the strategy game being made available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-has-more-shitty-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamurs Group, owner of sites like Dot Esports, Destructoid, and Twinfinite, had another <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamurs-group-employees-reportedly-hit-with-more-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round of layoffs this morning</a>, with several former staffers reporting they were laid off via impersonal emails while they slept. </p><p>A former Gamurs staffer told Aftermath that they woke up today to find their Slack access and work email had been cut off. The email they received informing them they'd been laid off addressed them by first name but included no mention of their position or other inclusion of their name.&nbsp;</p><p>Other former staffers echoed this experience on Twitter. Former Dot Esports and Tech Radar Gaming Editor Vic Hood <a href="https://x.com/hood_vic/status/1838483276064788549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on Twitter that she “woke up to an email that I’ve been let go.” Former Twinfinite and Game Skinny Managing Editor Tom Hopkins <a href="https://x.com/tomhopkins9/status/1838489596448928131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> “I have also been made redundant by Gamurs and Twinfinite over a generic email when I woke up this morning.” Former DotEsports employee Isaac McIntyre <a href="https://x.com/isaacmcintyre/status/1838485662498259151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> their layoffs was “Done by a 5:00pm email (no calls) and instant account-wide logouts, which was frankly disappointing considering my time with the company.”</p><p>This is seemingly par for the course for Gamurs layoffs, with former employee Mike Straw <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1838553591981670451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> that "This is exactly how they let me go last year...a boilerplate email that simply read 'Dear Freelancer' despite me being a staffed editor."</p><p>The former Gamurs staffer told Aftermath, “I'm honestly just a little heartbroken. Some really good people were let go today, with no warning, and it's going to just leave more scars on what's left of the sites under Gamurs. I don't know how a company can expect good writers to flourish when the ground beneath them is so shaky.”</p><p>Gamurs as a company seems to have no interest in writers flourishing, with <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports?giftLink=565a53d46178fcc56baa5645a6273ae9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former and current Gamurs employees</a> telling Aftermath back in March about low pay, chaotic layoffs, and a company flailing after traffic in the face of changing search and social media algorithms. One former writer told us then,</p><blockquote><p>It's hell…Everyone is stressed out. Coworkers are randomly getting cut for 'performance issues' week-to-week across all sites. The articles are all mindless. The only thing that matters is Google and what Google readers want. Creating a balance between work and life? Impossible. Corporate is breathing down everyone's necks to make sure every single writer is doing four articles a day. Gamurs is now a race to the bottom where every site is at risk of becoming an SEO content farm. The days of actually reporting are over. The acquired sites are losing all semblance of meaning and brand.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Before today, Gamurs previously had layoffs in <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-layoffs-destructoid-pc-invasion-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July</a>. Meanwhile, despite regularly conducting layoffs, over at the Gamurs Group <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career page</a> you can find a host of open roles, with freelance positions paying per piece at abysmal rates that include <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/804a21810e09-prima-games-freelance-games-writers-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$11-60 USD</a>, <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/708956bd1bd6-the-escapist-freelance-ea-fc-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$15-75</a>, and <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/4331529b541f-destructoid-freelance-weekend-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$16-90</a>.</p><p>Everyone involved here--from former Gamurs staffers, to the remaining folks at Gamurs, to people looking for work in games journalism, to people reading the work these sites put out--deserves better than this. We all deserve work <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/gaming-sites-writers-ai-editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by humans</a>, for humans to read, and the people who make that work deserve to be paid fairly and treated humanely, including when layoffs happen. </p><p>But that's not the day we're having today! Seeing this happen, time and again, is infuriating and heartbreaking, and my sympathy and rage go out to all affected.</p><p><strong>Update, 12:34pm:</strong> An email from Gamurs CEO Riad Chikhani and Chief Content Officer Kevin Morris, shared with Aftermath, said 30 people have been laid off across Gamurs. The message cites the company "restructuring our operations" and points to changing algorithms, including <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google's Helpful Content update</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-google-discover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Discover</a>, as making "clear that a larger reset and re-adjustment of priorities is necessary to ensure long-term sustainable growth for our business."</p><p>The execs also write that "we will be changing our pay structure for freelance writers to better reflect the value of longer, more in-depth work" and promise future details into what exactly that means.</p><p>They write that "As search has changed, it’s more clear than ever that doing what we love is actually the best path forward: creating great, high quality content about topics our audience cares deeply about." Given that this is the strategy writers at these sites were employing prior to Gamurs' acquisition of many of them, and given Gamurs' relentless pursuit of the exact <em>opposite</em> strategy since, I'm curious to see how this works out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new translucent shells come in five colors: green, pink, red, purple, teal, as well as a completely clear one. The controllers have black handles that make the colors pop, and new Chroma D-pads and back paddles that add a nice finishing touch.</p><p>Because the Cipher series is part of the design lab, Xbox owners can mix-and-match their favorite translucent shell with their preferred color scheme for the rest of the buttons and triggers. The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 starts at $150, which isn’t too bad for one of the best controllers out there, even if it still doesn’t come with all of the bells and whistles like drift-resistant hall-effect joysticks. </p><p>In addition to the new Elite variants, players looking for a cheaper option have something new to choose from as well. The Ghost Cipher Special Edition controller is only $70 and makes the entire body of the controller see-through with white and grey pieces inside and golden accents on the D-pad and triggers. It’s a companion piece to the previously announced Sky Cipher controller which is transparent blue. </p><p>At this point, I’d love to see them do that with the full set of the Elite’s colors, but for the base controllers. Especially that old-school Xbox green. And remember, you don’t need an Xbox Series X/S to make use of the new controllers. They work on PC, android, and iOS as well. Also the Nintendo Switch if you’re willing to jump through some extra hoops. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each game also comes with a screenplay and explainer “Master” book, and <strong>on Steam and Xbox at least, the mainline <em>MGS </em>games are being sold for $16 apiece</strong>. If you’ve wanted to get into the legendary stealth series, this is as good a deal as any, and it’s a journey well worth taking.</p><p>Should you decide that you want to keep going, some of the later entries in the franchise, especially some spinoffs, are also on sale. <strong><em>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Definitive Experience</em>, which bundles both the prologue <em>Ground Zeroes </em>and <em>The Phantom Pain</em>, is going for $18 on Steam and Xbox</strong>. My opinion of them is mixed, but most folks hold them up as standard bearers for open-world stealth games. <strong>The increasingly popular </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-xbox-series-x-s-pc-kojima-1851274738&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-xbox-series-x-s-pc-kojima-1851274738"><strong>cult classic <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></strong></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>is a completely different type of game, following the cyborg ninja Raiden as he hacks enemies to pieces in exceptionally bloody fashion, and you can also get it for $18 on Steam or for $12 on Xbox via backwards compatibility</strong>. If you’ve come this far, <strong>you might even be interested in checking out the widely panned zombie-themed <em>Metal Gear Survive</em> for $18,</strong> though most people would probably say you’re better off saving that money. I’m not your parent though, just your friendly neighborhood writer.</p><p>Outside of the <em>Metal Gear </em>games, Konami’s catalog isa little all over the place, but that’s kind of great in a way—it means that the publisher has a little something for everyone. For example, <em><strong>Silent Hill: Homecoming</strong></em><strong>—no one’s favorite </strong><em><strong>Silent Hill </strong></em><strong>game—is on sale on Steam for $8 in case you’re looking for a horror game to pick up ahead of the scary season</strong>. A pair of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>games—<em>Legacy of the Duelist </em>and its updated version <em>Link Evolution</em>—are on sale for $5 and $10, respectively, and I’ve learned that this franchise’s video games are quietly popular, so go nuts picking them up and all their discounted DLCs.</p><p>Elsewhere, Konami publishes a lot of retro collections and modern games that are deliberate throwbacks to the early days of video games. <strong><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>, for example, is currently $15 on Steam and Xbox, and <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection </em>can be picked up for $21.</strong> Even the most recent <em>Contra </em>title, a remake of the 1987 original, is on sale, as well as a collection of previous games in the series.</p><p><strong>There’s also a </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/konamipublishersale2024/?tab=2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/konamipublishersale2024/?tab=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>number of bundles on offer</strong></a></span><strong>, but the most significant one is the <em>Castlevania Collections Bundle</em>, which packages pretty close to 20 <em>Castlevania </em>games from the series’ decades-long history for $58.47. </strong>You get it, there’s a lot here and there’s miraculously even more:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>CYGNI: All Guns Blazing - $</strong>23.99 (was $29.99)</li><li><strong>Contra: Operation Galuga - </strong>$23.99 (was $29.99)</li><li><strong>Super Bomberman R 2 - </strong>$29.99 (was $49.99)</li><li><strong>GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon - </strong>$14.99 (was $24.99)</li><li><strong>Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection - </strong>$3.99 (was $19.99)</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Contra Anniversary Collection</em></strong><em> - </em>$3.99 (was $19.99)</li></ul><p>So regardless of whether or not you’re in the mood for a stealth game, a 2D beat ‘em up, a bloody good hack ‘n’ slash, or one of the foundational series to gaming’s favorite made up genre (Metroidvania), Konami’s sale might have something that’ll interest you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-qa-tester-blames-microsofts-policies-for-halo-infinite-issues/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A former QA at 343 Industries says that Microsoft is directly to blame for the issues that seemed to plague Halo Infinite from the start.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDrkD1ejGU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video covering</a> the Halo Infinite campaign, DLC, and more, former QA Briggs William Crane posted a lengthy comment — h/t to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ex-343-qa-claims-microsoft-contracting-policies-one-of-the-biggest-issues-ms-exclusives-seeing-a-downturn-in-quality-and-halos-struggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st </a>for spotting the message — on his thoughts as to why game struggled. He says it was due to a number of factors, but one of the biggest is Microsoft’s “contracting policies”.</p>



<p>“Microsoft’s contracting policies are single handedly one of the biggest issues that Halo faces,” Crane, who now works at Epic Games, said. “Can you imagine how difficult it is to do your best work knowing that they’ll get rid of you in 18 months and there’s nothing you can do about it? Plus that forces people out the door just as they become fully trained and competent at their positions.” </p>



<p>He then continued that a “significant” number of 343 Industries’ workforce is made up of contracted workers, including the past Master Chief Collection team.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft canceled its online appearance at the Tokyo Game Show due to “various circumstances”; however, Insider Gaming has learned that Ubisoft has also canceled its press previews of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>According to various sources, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows press previews were scheduled to take place next week, and the embargo date for the previews would be announced then. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is still scheduled to release on November 12, 2024, however, the recent announcements may suggest that the game might be delayed.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Ubisoft for comment but, as of yet, has yet to reply on the cancellation of the previews, but did not offer comment on the cancellation of the Tokyo Game Show. Earlier today, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement</a> about Tokyo Game Show:</p>



<p>“We regret to inform you that due to various circumstances, we have decided to cancel our online participation in Tokyo Game Show 2024 which was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM on September 26th,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>“We apologize for the short notice. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the broadcast.”</p>



<p>The company said that the “currently ongoing giveaway campaign” would continue despite the fact that the broadcast was no longer happening.</p>



<p>What do you think is going on with Assassin’s Creed Shadows? Let us know in the comments below! </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-unforgotten-echoes-and-heihachi-mishima-hands-on-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You think some measly lava can kill Heihachi Mishima?!</h2></div><section><p>It turns out that it’s really hard to kill a Tekken character, especially with gravity. Despite Tekken series creator Katsuhiro Harada doing his best to convince us that Heihachi Mishima was actually, really, <em>truly</em> 100% dead this time around, lo and behold the third DLC character for Tekken 8 is none other than the King of Iron Fist himself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The upcoming free story expansion for Tekken 8, titled Unforgotten Echoes, is all about explaining the how and the why of Heihachi’s return, and as part of a preview event, I got to play the entirety of the two-hour-long DLC campaign. My general impression? If you’re able to turn your brain off and just let it take you for a ride, it’s more good (albeit quite silly) ass Tekken story content.</p><p>While Unforgotten Echoes is an eight-chapter story of how and why Heihachi survived being tossed into a pool of lava at the end of Tekken 7, it actually begins by catching you up with what Eddy, Yoshimitsu, and Lidia were all doing during Tekken 8’s campaign. Eddy now works under Lidia as a part of a resistance force against G-Corp, alongside Yoshimitsu, who… I’m gonna be honest, largely just feels like window dressing throughout this entire DLC. Sorry Yoshimitsu fans, if you were disappointed at his lack of a presence in the base Tekken 8 story, this DLC still doesn’t really give him much of a chance to shine. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The early fights with Eddy do largely feel like filler, as there isn’t really much story consequence to them, but at least they’ve got some cool moments like Eddy reuniting with Jin for the first time since Tekken 6, and they also do a good job of including snippets of gameplay from old Tekken games as flashbacks, which is a very cool touch. </p><p>Eventually, Eddy, Lidia, and Yoshimitsu all get wrapped up in the lives of a group known as the Tekken Monks, which is where Heihachi comes into play. I don’t want to spoil how Heihachi managed to survive, or anything regards to his specific journey through the DLC, but I will say that the DLC does a good job of showing another side of Heihachi, and the way it ties back into the main storyline of Tekken 8 left me with a big old smile on my face, even more eager to see what’s next in the storied series. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for Heihachi himself, the word that comes to mind when describing what he feels like to play is "powerful".</p></div><p>As for Heihachi himself, the word that comes to mind when describing what he feels like to play as is “powerful”. That’s not to say that I think he’ll be one of the best characters in the game, but rather that his moves hit with such incredible force that “powerful” is just the first word that comes to mind. His attacks feel extremely impactful and brutal to look at, with a moveset that is filled with screen shaking stomps, slams, chops, and no shortage of electric wind god fists. It’s all extremely satisfying, even if he seems like a character that will require some serious time in the lab to get good with, thanks to usual just frame timings of the aforementioned Electric Wind God Fist that all Mishimas share, on top of also having a new stance in the Wind God’s Kamae, and a new mechanic that seemingly buffs his attacks and gives him access to new moves once he gets it to level 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ultimately, Unforgotten Echoes was a fine way to spend two hours, and does a good job of setting up whatever comes next in the world of Tekken by reintroducing Heihachi into the fold. Most importantly though, it’s free, and is a neat way to give the DLC characters a test drive to see if they fit your style of play before you drop actual money on them. Time will tell if Bandai Namco decides to do something similar for future DLC packs, or if this was just a special one-off due to Heihachi’s role in the story, and as a celebration of Tekken’s 30th anniversary. </p><p>In any case, you’ll be able to experience it all for yourself once Unforgotten Echoes is released in for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners on October 1, and for everyone else on October 4.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

Even the statue in the middle of the city stands recreated in the Cities: Skyline version.</p><p>A top down view of the city is also compared with a map of Baldur's Gate, showing how the modern city similarly folds around the ocean with docks jutting out.</p><p>It's not the first time fans of one particular game have expressed their appreciation in another.

            <p>Sega has confirmed a collaboration with DC on a series of Sonic the Hedgehog comics that will see the blue blur teaming up with the Justice League.</p>
<p>Earlier this week for Batman Day, the Sonic the Hedgehog social media account teased the collaboration, but at today's Sonic Central live stream further details were revealed.</p>
<p>The comics will see mash-ups like Shadow as Batman, Sonic as The Flash (naturally), and Knuckles as Superman, beginning as a series of comics in March 2025 written by Sonic writer Ian Flynn.</p>

<p>The comics will be accompanied by tie-in merchandise, including apparel and toys, and the collaboration will continue into 2026.</p>
<p>Indeed, much of the stream's focus was on merchandise as Sonic becomes something of a cash hog for Sega.</p>
<p>That included a Shadow motorcycle helmet from HJC, a Shadow PalVerse Palé figurine, and even (bizarrely) a collaboration with TopGolf.</p> <div>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> developers Behaviour Interactive have announced that they're acquiring Red Hook, the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon</a>. This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">laid off a bunch of people</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-project-t-has-been-cancelled/">cancelled a game</a> and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Red Hook will remain "a fully independent studio" under Behaviour, according to a definition of "independent" that has yet to be shared in full. "Darkest Dungeon has long been a series we've admired, enjoyed (and maybe even lost a little sleep over) as fans, and the opportunity to welcome Red Hook as a fully independent studio under the Behaviour banner is nothing short of a thrill," reads <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388">a statement on social media</a>. "We look forward to supporting Red Hook as they continue to do what they do best: put your sanity to the test." 
</p>
<p>
In a separate release, Behaviour CEO and co-founder Rémi Racine characterised the move as, essentially, a corporate exercise in adopting a fresh child because your festering, stay-at-home, gimlet-eye son needs a new playmate, bless him. "Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher - to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games," he wrote. "Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come." 
</p>
<p>
'Surrounds', eh? I'd keep your distance, Red Hook. If there's one thing Dead By Daylight is known for, it's cannibalising characters from other horror fictions. They said the Alien couldn't be tamed, Red Hook. I give it two months before the Entity abducts Wayne June and turns him into DLC.
</p>
<p>
Red Hook themselves seem happy with the arrangement, as you'd expect. In the same press release, co-founder Chris Bourassa described Behaviour as "kindred spirits", because "both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games". 
</p>
<p>
"The benefit from Red Hook's Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities," Bourassa added. "Behaviour's support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook's future, and focus fully on transforming Darkest Dungeon into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre."
</p>
<p>
Again, I'm not clear on how the 'independence' thing works here in practice - what will Behaviour do, besides providing development funds? They've confirmed that all 29 of Red Hook's existing team have been retained, at least.
</p>
<p>
Acquisitions aside, Red Hook are currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-strategy-game-kingdoms-update-is-coming-in-three-parts-with-the-first-due-in-2024">a kingdom-sized expansion for Darkest Dungeon 2</a> that turns it into a turn-based boardgame.

These moments look cheap, rushed, and more in line with a spam ad for a fake mobile game than the rest of the game’s vibrant pixel art.</p><p>They are, frankly, a mess that feels weirdly inserted into the rest of what looks like dutiful but competent proceedings. The scenes might be better ripped out of the game entirely, if it weren’t for how entertaining they are to encounter while watching others play on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/the-karate-kid-street-rumble&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/the-karate-kid-street-rumble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QledgZk3y2Q&amp;t=1432s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QledgZk3y2Q&amp;t=1432s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span>.

Maybe that’s why the game has fewer than 10 user reviews on Steam, with many of the ones that do exist expressing shock at the price tag juxtaposed with the bad cutscene art. </p><p>“The first problem I noticed was in the very first cut scene at the start of stage 1,” wrote on Steam reviewer. “If you are going to charge $40 for your licensed game, please at least get Daniel to actually look like Daniel and not some 30 year old random guy. I encourage everyone to take a short break from this review, go to YouTube, Google a long play of this, and watch the first cutscene. It is so bad it is worth witnessing for yourself.”</p></div><p>Hopefully the game eventually gets a steep price cut from publisher GameMill Entertainment, so that more people actually get to see the small Argentina-based team Odaclick Game Studio’s beautiful pixel art.

Instead, you have a set number of perk slots on each mask you equip, and you’ll need to manually go in and equip your perks on each loadout.</p><p>You can do this at any reality thread (this game’s version of bonfires) that you visit along your journey, so be sure to swap them around when you buy powerful new options from the Path of Innovators.</p><h2 id="h14163"><a id=""></a><strong>The Preparedness perk is awesome</strong></h2><p>Speaking of perks, I must recommend Preparedness. This perk is unlocked from the get-go and provides your character with a really cool passive ability. With Preparedness equipped, you’ll Unravel enemies slightly when dodging their attacks.</p><p>This can be surprisingly useful, particularly early in your adventure while you’re still learning the ropes, as it will typically apply enough Unravel to weak foes to stun them with a single well-timed dodge. In turn, this opens them up for a nice critical attack certain to drain their health.</p><h2 id="h14164"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast travel is unlocked from the beginning</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-recommend-id="image://1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jyamma Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-recommend-id="image://1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike many soulslike titles, which force you to reach a certain point in the story to unlock fast travel, <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em> offers you the ability to teleport between reality knots from the very beginning.</p><p>As such, you’re able to revisit any previously explored areas that felt a bit difficult during the first few hours, so that you can show those enemies your new-found power with a few more levels under your belt.</p><h2 id="h14165"><a id=""></a><strong>Farm any crabs you come across</strong></h2><p>You’ll come across some crab enemies very early in the game, and they’re an excellent source of Memoria (XP). While they only grant 40 Memoria per kill individually, they have a relatively decent chance of dropping consumable items called Valuable Shells, which can be used to receive 2,000 Memoria at once. That’s a hell of a lot of XP during the first area of the game.</p><p>If you want to tackle these little crabs, fast travel to the Shores of Quinta reality thread. Turn around from where you spawn, and head into the little beach cave behind you where three of these enemies will be waiting. Slay them and hope for a Valuable Shell, then rinse and repeat as necessary.</p><h2 id="h14166"><a id=""></a><strong>Ranged attacks can be parried</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of pesky archers scattered throughout <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em>, but if you can get a feel for the timing of their shots, there’s some good news: You can parry them.</p><p>Even better, parrying the arrows of the weak archers will automatically Unravel them and allow you to approach for a one-shot kill.

<p>T1 recently celebrated its twentieth anniversary, looking back on two decades of success as an esports organisation. Over many years, T1 has become one of the most recognisable brands in the industry, boasting multi-million-dollar wins, rockstar players, and iconography that millions of fans feel proud to represent.</p>



<p>During ESI Lisbon, T1’s CEO and COO took to the stage to reflect on the last 20 years before pivoting and focusing on what comes next for the legendary organisation.</p>



<p>It seems that the company’s leadership team is going all in with Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-here-to-stay">‘It’s Here to Stay’</h2>



<p>At ESI Lisbon, T1’s CEO, Joe Marsh, and the firm’s COO, Josh Ahn, graced the stage to deliver a presentation focused on the company’s success over the last two decades. Marsh had bold things to say about the future of the esports industry, which T1 has spent many years trying to spearhead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports is the new version of sports for the younger generation, and it’s here to stay.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair revealed that in the past five years, they’ve increased T1’s revenue by 3300%, even during COVID-19, which saw many organisations face a massive downturn. From a business perspective, Ahn revealed that T1’s merchandise sales are posed to overtake the revenue earned from sponsorships for the first time, which is a huge deal.</p>



<p>Typically, most revenue in the esports space is made up of advertising and sponsorships. This is a testament to the power of the T1 brand and the popularity of the product, particularly in South Korea.</p>



<p>Ahn then explained that they’re putting more eggs in the ‘Faker basket’. Faker has long been a superstar of the esports industry and has been branded the GOAT by many millions of fans. He’s one of the most instantly recognisable competitors on the planet, and his passion is nothing short of intense and inspirational.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to make something similar to the Jordan brand but with Faker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ahn was referring to Michael Jordan’s prolific partnership with Nike, which was kickstarted in 1984. It’s now worth almost $7 billion to Nike.</p>



<p>It’s tough to see Faker-branded products hitting those lofty heights, but there should be a comparable success, downscaled a little to accommodate for the still-growing market that is esports. He remains one of the most appreciated and storied competitors in the business, so if anyone can do it, it’s him.</p>



<p>T1 recently landed in the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, a win that came months after a victory at the League of Legends World Championship. The team is now preparing to go back-to-back at this year’s LoL Worlds, which starts tomorrow.</p>



<p>Do you think Faker is an iconic enough player to have a successful lifestyle brand built in his image? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>
