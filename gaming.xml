            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Anbernic announced its next retro handheld today and it’s easy to see where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64M_BHXsiiE&amp;t=1s">design of the RG34XX draws its inspiration</a>. It appears to be a faithful clone of Nintendo’s original Game Boy Advance, although updated with <a href="https://x.com/KeepRetro/status/1865057457157877766">additional action and shoulder buttons</a> allowing games from more recent systems to be played. Pricing and availability hasn’t been revealed yet, but the RG34XX will come in transparent red and green colors, as well as the GBA’s purple and black.</p><p>One feature Anbernic didn’t carry forward is the Game Boy Advance’s LCD screen which lacked a backlight and was notoriously difficult to see unless you were playing outside on a sunny day or cozied up next to a bright lamp. The RG34XX will instead feature a larger 3.4-inch display with a 720x480 resolution. The display will also use the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the Game Boy Advance, so GBA titles should look great, and older games developed for 4:3 TV screens will fit without extensive stretching or pillarboxing.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RG34XX will be available in purple or black colors, and transparent red or green.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keep Retro</cite></p></div><p>As with previous Anbernic handhelds, the RG34XX doesn’t have a cartridge slot like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">Analogue Pocket</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">ModRetro Chromatic</a>. It’s instead designed to play games through software emulation. Details on the RG34XX’s processor aren’t known yet, but <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/anbernic-rg34xx-announced/">Retro Handhelds speculates</a> it will be based on the Allwinner H700 chipset the company has <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx">used in its other XX series handhelds</a>. If that’s the case, you can expect it to play games from older consoles up to the original Sony PlayStation, and even some N64 and Sega Dreamcast titles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RG34XX will include two sets of shoulder buttons, a mini HDMI port, USB-C for charging, and dual microSD slots.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keep Retro</cite></p></div><p>The RG34XX will include Wi-Fi connectivity facilitating online play as well as streaming PC titles through <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a>, and Bluetooth for connecting multiple wireless controllers for shared screen multiplayer. If that 3.4-inch screen still seems too small, the RG34XX also includes a mini HDMI port for connecting it to a TV, alongside a USB-C port for charging, and a pair of microSD card slots for storing ROMs and its operating system.</p><div><p>This isn’t the first time that Anbernic has copied Nintendo’s homework. Earlier this year the company released its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152105/can-you-resist-anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-that-plays-ps1-and-n64-games">RG35XXSP with a design inspired by the clamshell Game Boy Advance SP</a> but with an improved screen, a more capable processor, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177983/this-amazing-knockoff-gba-sp-comes-stuffed-with-software-piracy">concerning number of pre-installed pirated ROMs</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other shows have been uploaded to YouTube and emulate the interactivity using on-screen links and cards that take you to other archived videos. This is actually a similar method to how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/52ZkFD-YlmY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/52ZkFD-YlmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix created some YouTube-exclusive ads</a></span> promoting the interactive shows a few years ago. </p><p>In order to get people to talk to them, <em>404 Media </em>agreed not to share the Discord channel and other places where these archiving methods are happening. <em>Kotaku </em>will also not be sharing them. There is a fear in the community that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">Netflix</a></span> will crack down on their efforts if these alternative options are too publicly shared online. </p><p>Pixel told <em>404 Media</em> that Netflix’s interactive shows relied on an “internal video” that contained all the different paths and endings. According to the archivist, these interactive shows were controlled by two JSON files. One controlled decisions and where to skip to in the video and the other file pulled in assets for the buttons.</p><p>“We currently have a proof-of-concept emulator running off a Python script that uses the JSONs to make functioning decisions, although it needs ironing out and button images are broken as of now,” explained Pixel. “We have a member of the team in Turkey that is hosting the files for once we get the emulator working on a webpage.”</p><p>According to Pixel, right now the biggest challenge the fans face in archiving all of this deleted Netflix content is keeping track of everything. </p><p>“We have a lot of people counting on us,” said Pixel, “And I get a LOT of DMs from people asking how to play them.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Marvel Rivals GB file size question is upon us. With so many different platforms to house superhero battles of titanic proportions, you need to know how much storage to keep free. We’ve got the lowdown on Marvel Rivals’ file size on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Before you can have fun, we first need to know if you’re <em>allowed </em>to have fun. To play Marvel Rivals and Punish-er people, you need to have the necessary allocation of space. Whether it’s a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC, it’s all the same. In today’s age of gaming, it’s not uncommon for games to exceed 100GB, which can mean sacrifices have to be made.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a mighty game, so let’s see how much stress it places on your hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-playstation-5">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not bad. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals requires 36.58 GB of free space on a PlayStation 5 to let you install it and play it—at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>Round this up and call it 40 GB, which allows for future updates to increase the size anyway. All in all, I think 36 GB is quite generous, and with Call of Duty suffocating my PS5’s storage, this is a blessing.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-xbox-series-x-s">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>On Xbox, Marvel Rivals requires 44.56 GB of empty storage space, and, again, this is before any updates potentially increase this figure.</strong></p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/12/04/marvel-rivals-pre-load-is-up-on-xbox-install-size-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, and it does mean players associated with the green brand need a little more free space than those on PlayStation—I’m not here to flame or cause any wars! If you do take umbrage with Xbox’s slightly higher GB requirements, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-crossplay-cross-progression-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals has crossplay</a>, so settle your score on the battlefield.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-pc">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s manageable. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A quick check of Steam shows Marvel Rivals needs 47.5 GB on PC, and this makes it the highest GB total of any platform.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I couldn’t tell you why PC players get it worse, but this is the case. Again, it’s less than 50 GB, and for an intense online multiplayer title with deep visuals and a ton of on-screen action, you can’t complain. If you are struggling, either uninstall a game or two or consider upgrading your internal storage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[TikTok Is Now One Step Closer To Being Banned in the United States]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tiktok-is-now-one-step-closer-to-being-banned-in-the-united-states.1054143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the United States, a federal appeals court has stood firm in the face of TikTok’s attempts to avoid a blanket ban across the nation. The court upheld a law that has been tossed to and fro for years, with US legislators seeking to <strong>force </strong>ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, into a divestiture in the United States.</p>



<p>Despite the application being used by more than 150 million Americans, lawmakers in the US have been trying to ban it for several years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us">Will TikTok Be Banned in the US?</h2>



<p>This all stems from the United States’ insistence that ByteDance and TikTok are linked to the Chinese state, which the tech titan has actively denied on several occasions. </p>



<p>On the decision, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>TikTok’s millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication. That burden is attributable to China’s hybrid commercial threat to&nbsp;US national security, not to the US government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated by the appeals court that the law being lobbied in an attempt to ban the app <em>“was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents. It was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC.”</em></p>



<p>TikTok has some US forces in its pocket, though. In a statement, the deputy director of ACLU’s National Security, Patrick Toomey, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Banning TikTok blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use this app to express themselves and communicate with people around the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, ByteDance has until January 19 to sell or divest TikTok’s assets in the United States – or face a nationwide ban. There’s a chance that President Biden could grant an extension to that deadline, and ByteDance has moved to challenge the decision of the appeals court in the Supreme Court, but it’s all still up in the air.</p>



<p>In the run-up to his successful election campaign, Donald Trump said he’d block the ban – four years after trying to actively shut the application down in the United States. However, if no extension lands and the Supreme Court refuses to help, Donald Trump won’t be in office before the deadline arrives, which renders his support moot.</p>



<p>Would you suffer if TikTok was banned in the United States? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Riot Games also has grand ambitions of expanding the reach of Project K by partnering with stores for local events in addition to larger national and international tournaments featuring the best players in the world.</p><p>However, Riot Games doesn't appear to have a publishing and promotional partner in the US TGC scene yet. That's why Project K's initial launch will take place in the Chinese market in early 2025. According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/490418/league-legends-card-game-tcg-riot-games-project-k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Riot wants Project K's American launch to be as close as possible to the Chinese debut. But for now, there's no firm date for Project K's release in the United States.</p><p>Earlier this week, Riot addressed some of the fan backlash it received over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-push-back-against-league-of-legends-characters-arcane-makeover/1100-6528263/" data-ref-id="1100-6528263">Viktor's Arcane-inspired makeover</a> in League of Legends. The company has also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-new-seasonal-model-with-welcome-to-noxus/1100-6528085/" data-ref-id="1100-6528085">League of Legends is introducing a seasonal model</a> starting in January 2025. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a> wrapped up its two-season run on Netflix last month, Riot has indicated that more adaptations are on the way. They just won't involve Avengers: Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo, because the duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-got-paid-5-million-to-not-make-a-league-of-legends-movie-report/1100-6527614/" data-ref-id="1100-6527614">was paid $5 million</a> after their plans to make a live-action League of Legends movie fell apart over creative differences.</p>

		<p>Pine Studios has announced a sequel to Escape Simulator, unsurprisingly called Escape Simulator 2. This new entry to the escape room genre will feature even more scenarios for players to figure their way out of, with up to eight players able to play together. The announcement trailer gives a look at what kind of environments players should expect in Escape Simulator 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Simulator 2: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gsl4DvPyJs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“A sequel gives us the opportunity to start fresh and push the boundaries of the escape room genre. For Escape Simulator 2, we were inspired to explore darker themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle mechanics. This sequel also brings significant technical upgrades, including a new rendering engine, rewritten netcode, improved physics, and enhanced animations. While Escape Simulator 2 adopts a darker, more mysterious tone compared to the original, it’s not a horror game—there are no jump scares or gore. We love the Escape Simulator community and we plan to continue</em><br>
<em>supporting the original game while expanding and enhancing Escape Simulator 2 after its</em><br>
<em>launch”, </em>said Boris Barbir, Co-Founder at Pine Studio.</p>
<p>Escape Simulator 2 will allow players to try and puzzle their way out of Dracula’s castle, a stranded spaceship, and look for cursed treasure. These are just three of the 12 scenarios that will be part of the base game. There will be a room editor too that will allow players to create their own puzzles and share them with the wider community. Escape Simulator will be available on PC via Steam.</p>

No matter what the title, and no matter who the developer, every announcement is meticulously scrutinized for any faint sign of a thoughtcrime, an element that could be construed by these charlatans as proof of “wokeness,” something they can decry as “a DEI initiative,” and then this speculative notion is spun out to followers as the latest attempt to TAKE AWAY YOUR GAMES! The latest target is <em>Avowed</em>, but in picking on it, those running the grift have rather shown their hand.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,197298,197284" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like any online scam of any note, it’s so brazen that it’s only more depressing that it works so well. As much as it might infuriate you that someone you know would fall for a cold caller telling them they need to send gift certificates to fix an issue with their Windows operating system, it should equally upset you that these legions of people fall for the same woke gaming grift over and over and over. But with <em>Avowed</em>, the forthcoming Obsidian role-playing game set in the world of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, the con is so brazenly laid bare. Yes of course it still works, but it’s so much easier to see how.</p><p>The schtick works like this: A game is announced, and because it’s 2024, that game may not exclusively focus on a white dude saving the world for the lady in a bikini, (or a sexy lady playing dress-up in various bikinis while saving the world). I mean, some still do, but this is an industry that creates games that feature a broad range of characters. The grifters recognize this as a useful target for their grift, making claims that the game is artificially altered from what should have been, based on a desire to be perceived as progressive. They then use this to convince large numbers of disaffected young men that the world is trying to take away from them their last vestige of entertainment, the only place left where they feel represented and prioritized. The only hope is to rise up and fight, fight for what’s rightfully theirs—and if they like, give some money to the grifter for a project that never sees daylight.</p><p>Except, with <em>Avowed</em>, those behind the grift forgot to include a couple of vital stages. They forgot to develop the spurious claims on which to condemn the project, failing to identify something that had been artificially included or an element that had been censored in the name of wokeness. And in doing so, they made incredibly clear what it is that’s really at the bottom of all of this: bigotry.</p><p>Around the time of Gamescom this year, the usual people started loudly condemning <em>Avowed</em> as the next piece of woke mind virus-addled DEI. Why? What sin had it committed? Had a mission leaked in which you’re forced to help a gay polycule adopt a cat-identifying trans child at an abortion clinic? Nope, it was this image:</p><figure id="" data-id="cd4e175a33e13c79991ccbd51d81fb13" data-recommend-id="image://cd4e175a33e13c79991ccbd51d81fb13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Avowed pre-order promotional image, showing a blue man, a white elf with pink hair, a black woman and perhaps a black dwarf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Avowed pre-order promotional image, showing a blue man, a white elf with pink hair, a black woman and perhaps a black dwarf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd4e175a33e13c79991ccbd51d81fb13" data-recommend-id="image://cd4e175a33e13c79991ccbd51d81fb13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Avowed pre-order promotional image, showing a blue man, a white elf with pink hair, a black woman and perhaps a black dwarf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>See it? See the intolerable act of evil? No? Goodness me, don’t tell me the woke mind virus has got to you, too!</p><p>There’s <em>no white man</em>. That’s right, this violently racist piece of marketing includes a black woman, a white elf-like woman, a blue man, and an ambiguous-race dwarf. How more clearly could the developer be saying that it wants this game to be exclusively played during drag queen story hour at your local library?</p><p>Honestly, to even notice the fact feels kinda weird. I’m a white guy living in a country that’s 90 percent white, in an area of the country that’s 95 percent white, and as such, I’m fairly used to seeing people who look like me everywhere I go. But the thought didn’t cross my inherently racist mind. I’m the last person who can deliver that ghastly, “I don’t even SEE race!” bullshit people like to say instead of thinking. Yet, I saw…some people. People in a fantasy world. Fantasy game people. I’ll give them this, though: I noticed one of them had blue skin. That stood out. Fucking typical DEI inclusion initiative. If I see a blue person flying a plane, I’m getting off there and then! Etc.</p><p>And in this, in this alone, the entire scam was shown for what it really is: just unabashed racism, homophobia, and misogyny.</p><p>That’s it. It’s so boring, but it’s all it is. Racism, homophobia, and misogyny are profitable, so they’re the focus. But don’t worry, they’ll prove how not-racist they are by pointing to their furious ongoing (although mostly forgotten) campaign against Ubisoft for including a black man in an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game set in Japan.</p><p>That first <em>Avowed</em> fuss came and went in the summer, the game permanently marked to be condemned. When I wrote about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-preview-obsidian-rpg-pillars-eternity-1851631371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-preview-obsidian-rpg-pillars-eternity-1851631371">my excellent hour with the game on <em>Kotaku</em></a></span> in August, the replies on X were bilious complaints about how the game was going to promote a woke agenda. Based on, you know, that picture. And then everyone forgot they were so outraged about that, and moved on to the next topic.</p><p>But oh boy, what bigger gift could the grifters have received when November’s <em>Avowed</em> previews came around? Because, when a bunch of journalists (boo! hiss!) were given access to the opening few hours of the game, it was revealed that the game’s character creator had the option for “they/them” pronouns. SOUND THE KLAXONS!</p><figure id="" data-id="1e53fa5e3cb417a9a4524d6b9b688575" data-recommend-id="image://1e53fa5e3cb417a9a4524d6b9b688575" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person view of swinging a long weapon toward a skeleton in a robe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A first-person view of swinging a long weapon toward a skeleton in a robe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e53fa5e3cb417a9a4524d6b9b688575" data-recommend-id="image://1e53fa5e3cb417a9a4524d6b9b688575" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person view of swinging a long weapon toward a skeleton in a robe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was one of those SJW lamestream media “journalists.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-rpg-obsidian-hands-on-preview-xbox-pc-1851703825&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-rpg-obsidian-hands-on-preview-xbox-pc-1851703825">I spent six hours playing the game</a></span> and had an absolutely brilliant time with it, and that’s despite there not being a single mission in which I had to paint rainbow flags on the walls of a church, nor any plotline in which I helped a blur-haired immigrant gain access to free healthcare. Instead, I was…I was fighting spiders and shit.</p><p>Because this is the third game set in the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> canon, which is a world primarily focused on matters of the misuse of dark magic and the questionable nature of its deities. <em>Avowed</em> is a game about a disease called the Dreamscourge causing people to grow mushrooms all over their bodies and go insane. Your character, who can be the whitest man you ever fucking saw in your life, if you’d like, is an envoy for a wannabe-colonial nation, and you can choose to be as pro- or anti-that as you want with the game’s broad choices of dialogue. As much as I tried, I couldn’t find a single woke thing to do! I even chose boring old “she/her” pronouns in the character creator, because my character was a woman with excellent fungal madness growing out of her face.</p><p>But oh <em>boy</em>, are the grifters on fire about <em>Avowed.</em> They saw the previews about how you could hit spiders with swords, and they saw the few that mentioned the pronouns (it didn’t seem particularly exciting to me, so I didn’t think to mention it), and that was it. They were proven right! That earlier picture failing to feature Jeff from accounting <em>was</em> all the evidence they’d needed, and they’d been proven correct to declare the game would cause their DEI detectors to start shrieking. In the last week, they have been sending out absolutely deranged messages about how the game is “doomed” because one of its art directors tweeted something about Elon Musk. “<em>Avowed</em> is in deep trouble,” they post to each other on X, their brows furrowed in concern over the severity of it all.</p><p>Because, yes, horrendously, the world’s richest bigot has been posting about <em>Avowed</em> too, condemning its use of pronouns, and deliberately re-interpreting the art director’s mocking sarcasm to be a statement of intent to be “racist” against “white guys.”</p><figure id="" data-id="8160fb4f393bd05d8fcd9ccb282111ef" data-recommend-id="image://8160fb4f393bd05d8fcd9ccb282111ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pile of pre-school squishy books about numbers, letters and colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pile of pre-school squishy books about numbers, letters and colors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>An artist’s impression of the anti-woke playbook.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dr.Rapeti / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8160fb4f393bd05d8fcd9ccb282111ef" data-recommend-id="image://8160fb4f393bd05d8fcd9ccb282111ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pile of pre-school squishy books about numbers, letters and colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s the exact same playbook described above, of taking something incredibly minor entirely out of context (the guy is laughing at those who think the game is negative toward white people, given that’s not even vaguely something the game’s about), reframing it as something serious (“It should not be acceptable for any company in the gaming industry to be racist &amp; sexist against ‘white guys’,” wrote Musk), and then acting entirely on that reframed, imaginary version, declaring that the game is already doomed to fail based on this fictional enormity.</p><p>Hot off the back of their success in <em>destroying</em> another RPG, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which utterly flopped thanks to their efforts with a miserable <em>million sales</em> in its first two weeks, they refer back to that extraordinary win as proof that <em>Avowed</em> is doomed to the same terrible fate. “We’re winning,” they endlessly message their gullible followers, and then that’s true too.</p><p>It’s just boring racism, homophobia, and misogyny, folks.

The game hasn’t “replaced” anyone with a minority-representing character, it hasn’t changed the length of a schoolgirl’s dress, it hasn’t removed a reference to something unpleasant that got through in a version from the 1990s. None of the usual <em>massive crimes</em>. It just had a picture of some people, an entirely ignorable tickbox on the character creator screen, and a sarcastic art director who thinks toolbag Elon Musk is a toolbag. But they’re going after it too, because, more than anything else, it hasn’t made any special effort to center a straight, white man in its marketing. Because, when it’s all stripped away, that’s all this is about. Pure bigotry.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next game from the developers of It Takes Two is set to be unveiled soon with a release date just a few months after. According to known data minter <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, Hazelight Studios is preparing to announce its new game called Split Fiction.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will release on March 6, 2025, and will be available on PC and consoles. The specific consoles are currently unknown.</p>



<p>As far as an announcement of the game, the report says that its expected to happen this month. The likely place would be during The Game Awards on December 12. Why The Game Awards for the reveal? As billbil-kun pointed out, studio founder Josef Fares has made a history of announcing his games at the annual show.</p>







<p>“Josef Fares is a regular at this ceremony since he has reserved the announcements of his previous titles, such as&nbsp;A Way Out&nbsp;or&nbsp;It Takes Two, in past editions,” they said.</p>



<p>No other details about what Split Faction is were revealed, but those questions should be answered when the game is official revealed this month. Based on the name and the studio’s history, however, it could be assumed that Split Faction will be another co-op game</p>



<p>What do you think Hazelight Studios’ Split Faction will be about? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-evolves-its-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had a weighty task to spar with: following up on one of the most in-depth, skill-based, historically-inspired melee combat systems to ever slice its way into the RPG world. But it's no secret that it was an uphill battle just to become competent with the first game's complex directional strikes and precisely-timed blocks. Plenty of players bounced off of those demanding skill requirements. But the technical demands of the combat, and the feeling of getting better as a player, were also a huge part of what made it great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhorse's goal for the sequel, then, was twofold. They wanted to lower the skill floor required to play competently – without getting your butt handed to you in a cloth sack by any random bandit – but also raise the skill ceiling required to take on the very most unforgiving optional challenges. In terms of the story, this checks out. Henry was a complete nobody in KCD1, but by the time the sequel begins, he's been an aspiring swordsman for quite a while now. It wouldn't really make sense for him to still be struggling against poorly-trained opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">On Your Left…</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first way this is obvious is that KCD1's five attack directions have been reduced to four: up, down, left, and right. Swords use all four, but not all weapons do. Polearms, for instance, generally only have three, which is something to consider when choosing a fighting style. KCD1 also had two different attack buttons: slash and stab. In KCD2, all basic attacks are generally slashing. Thrusts still exist as part of multi-hit combos, but only on weapons where they make sense. You won't be poking people with the tip of a blunt weapon like a mace, for instance.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Warhorse wanted to lower the skill floor required to play competently – without getting your butt handed to you in a cloth sack by any random bandit – but also raise the skill ceiling required to take on the very most unforgiving optional challenges.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Blocking can now defend you from multiple opponents, as long as they're all in front of you. And finally, the parry system feels a bit more intuitive and forgiving. Aiming your parries correctly still matters, but more so against tougher enemies. And even in that case, you'll mostly be punished for blocking in the opposite direction of their attack, rather than any direction that wasn't the correct one. That is, you don't have to get it perfect. You just have to avoid getting it completely wrong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This all cuts down on the number of possible decisions you might have to weigh at any given moment in combat. But managing stamina, watching opponents, and making good decisions is still important. This is paired with the fact that a lot of the early-game enemies are now tuned to be Henry's martial inferiors, so you can cut your teeth on some fights where you're favored to win before taking on tougher opponents – a big change from getting beaten up by the town drunk in the first hour of KCD1.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Way of the Blade</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've mastered the first game's combat, though, Warhorse doesn't want to leave you without new mountains to climb. The very most skilled players will find that the ceiling has been raised as well. One major focus for this change is to the master strike, a late-game ability Henry could learn that had the potential to trivialize most encounters if you got really good with it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In KCD1, perfect blocking and master striking was super useful and basically, if you were willing to play very defensively, you could have overcome everything with just this move," lead designer Prokop Jirsa explained. "It doesn't work like that in KCD2. There's still master strike but it's much harder to implement and there's defenses even against master strike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, the best fighters out there aren't going to fall for your master strike spam anymore. And you'll be encouraged to take a more aggressive approach, rather than sitting back and waiting for your opponent to make a mistake. You'll also need to focus more on varying up your moves and using all of the tools available to you. And that range of tools has been expanded.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Armed to the Teeth</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The flashiest new additions are crossbows and guns. It's 1403, so we're talking about very primitive guns that take forever to reload and aren't accurate at all beyond a few paces. But if they're pointed the right way at close enough range, they'll do some serious damage. They have a psychological impact, too. Enemies in KCD2 will decide if it's still worth fighting based on how the fight is going and how tough they think they are. If you take out the captain with a loud boom and a flash of fire, his underlings might just head for the hills. Nobody's getting paid enough to deal with whatever that thing is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while the sword is still the most versatile weapon, the new combo system gives you more reason to use other melee weapons as well. One example Jirsa gave was how maces have some unique combos that can target joints or unarmored areas on a target. If you notice your foe isn't wearing any leg armor, for instance, you could specifically execute a combo that goes for the legs without having to manually aim down at them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of the sneakier persuasion, stealth kills have also been improved. In KCD1, it was basically a dice roll comparing your stats to the stats of your target to see if an assassination would be successful, which could feel frustratingly random in such a skill-based game. KCD2 has changed things up to be timing-based instead. And you don't need perfect timing to do away with your opponent, necessarily. But if you're half a second off the mark, you may not pull off the kill silently, with the target's dying screams alerting nearby allies.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Murderer's Row</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The other way Warhorse is aiming to keep combat interesting even for seasoned swordmasters is by dialing up the difficulty of the most challenging optional content. Simply following the main story shouldn't throw anything too wildly unfair your way. But if you're willing to go off the beaten path in search of trouble, you'll be able to find it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In KCD1, actually, when you got really good, the end game was really easy," Jirsa said. "This is something we improved in KCD2 as well. There are big challenges in the end game. There are some which even people from this office struggled to overcome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So whether you got scared off from the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance the first time you got turned into sashimi by some Cumans, or you're on your third playthrough and can throw down master strikes with your eyes closed, you should find something for you in the sequel. And when all else fails, you can just bring a gun to the sword fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues. You should especially check out my in-depth hands-on preview for my impressions of this new combat system so far!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Experiencing escape rooms is the closest thing many fans will have to being in a real video-game world. Three years ago, Pine Studio's Escape Simulator brought that experience home. Now, Pine Studio is doing it again with Escape Simulator 2. The accompanying announcement trailer includes a glimpse at three of the upcoming escape rooms, none of which are confined to a single environment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsl4DvPyJs4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gsl4DvPyJs4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Escape Simulator 2 will allow 1-8 players to step into intricately designed escape rooms that were created with help from real-life escape-room builders. The three rooms seen in the trailer are set in a pirate ship linked to a cursed treasure, an enigmatically empty starship stranded in space, and Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania. Before players can get out, they will be tasked to solve smaller mysteries in each room that add to the lore behind the experience.</p><p>Pine Studio co-founder Boris Barbir released a statement that touted the sequel's technical upgrades, including improved physics and animations. And despite the ominous tone of the trailer, Barbir insisted that "it's not a horror game--there are no jump scares or gore." He also pledged that Pine Studio will continue to support the original Escape Simulator while offering expansions for Escape Simulator 2 post-launch.</p><p>Escape Simulator 2 is now available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>, but a release date was not included in the announcement. The original Escape Simulator <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is currently on Steam</a> at a big discount, and it has a new Mayan DLC expansion that offers four additional escape room adventures to explore in the jungle.</p>

Even better, this decision also means players who experience photosensitive seizures or need help with speech when gaming now have unfettered access to these patents as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Accessibility features in gaming have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/access-ability-announces-june-2024-summer-showcase/1100-6523281/">gained steam in recent years</a> as developers and software engineers work to ensure players with disabilities can access their games. In 2021, EA pledged to loosen restrictions on its patents, especially patents regarding hardware or software that's meant to improve a player's quality of life. Now, <a href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 2021 pledge has been updated</a> to announce the two patents that have been made available for free.</p><p dir="ltr">EA says that the ultimate goal of its speech-based patent is to "make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language, and speaking style." The second patent is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin called IRIS. IRIS automatically alerts developers to moments in their games that may trigger seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.</p><p dir="ltr">"The sooner you start testing, the sooner you find potential issues," IRIS engineer Blanca Macazaga Zuaz said of the patented tech.</p><p>EA is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-access-controller-is-setting-up-an-accessibility-revolution/1100-6518347/">far from the only corporation</a> to lean in to accessibility features, but its decision to provide the public free access to the aforementioned patents is certainly an encouraging sign.</p>

			<p>If you've been getting stuck into the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest game</a> from MachineGames, you'll know that you're stepping into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">role of Indiana Jones</a>. In this game, you'll get to hunt for relics, solve puzzles, and, of course, fight off many villains. If you've been doing your exploring correctly, you will have come across some Skill Books in the game. Don't panic if you don't know what they're for just yet, as this guide will explain everything you need to know about the Skill Books and how to use them in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<h2>How To Use Skill Books in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As you're adventuring as Indiana Jones, you'll be able to obtain Adventure Books. You can also call them Skill Books, as that is technically what they are. They provide new skills or buffs to your pre-existing skills, which can help you survive in the vast world you'll explore, as well as help you with combat and brawling. Picking up the book doesn't automatically mean that you've learned a new skill, though. By cycling to the Books tab in your main menu, you'll find a list of all of the books you've found under their relevant categories.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the books that are available in that category. If you hover over the book that interests you, it will tell you what you need to be able to use the book and learn the skill. To learn a skill, you need <strong>Adventure Points</strong>. Adventure Points are earned by finding secrets during your exploration, by collecting hidden items such as posters and letters, and even by taking pictures using your camera. There are plenty of things hidden in the world of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, making it easy for you to tally up Adventure Points fast enough, as long as you're thorough with your exploration and look in every nook and cranny you come across.</p>
<p>Once you have the required amount of Adventure Points, you'll then be able to learn the skill by reading the book, and the skill will be activated, allowing you to use it when you need to.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about how to use skill books in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Good luck exploring!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-things-to-know-before-starting-marvel-rivals.1054074/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is out now and free to play on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The hero shooter pretty shamelessly draws inspiration from <em>Overwatch</em>. As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae that are different and worth keeping in mind, even if you’ve spent hundreds of hours in similar games. I put about 15 hours into <em>Marvel Rivals</em> during its test periods and about a few additional hours since its launch on December 5. So here are a few tips for newcomers if you’re jumping into the game for the first time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h155891"><a id=""></a><strong>Spend some time in the practice range</strong></h2><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>launched <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">with a sizable roster</a></span>. With 33 characters right off the bat, it can be overwhelming to find which heroes you jive with. <em>Rivals </em>matches are so fast-paced that deciphering what each character does can be confusing, as well. Your best bet in finding a hero you gravitate toward is to spend some time in the practice range first. Here you’ll have full access to the whole roster and can train on some robot dummies. Just a few minutes in here will give you a starting point before heading into online matches. This way you’re not completely fumbling in the dark without any frame of reference for how characters play. The best way to learn all the intricacies is by playing a real battle, of course, but going in blind will make that on-ramp more difficult.</p><h2 id="h155892"><a id=""></a><strong>Actually read your Hero Profile</strong></h2><p>Part of getting to know all the heroes is learning their moveset, but several of them have passive abilities you’ll never actually press a button to activate but are still worth knowing. In the hero select screen you can access each character’s Hero Profile, which contains a straightforward rundown of all their abilities, active and passive. Read these before you actually run out into a fight if you’re trying someone new, it’ll be the difference between winging it and having some tactics in mind for how to handle a fight.</p><h2 id="h155893"><a id=""></a><strong>Here’s a rundown of the currencies</strong></h2><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is free-to-play, and that means it makes most of its money by way of microtransactions. None of the heroes are locked behind a paywall, but cosmetics like costumes, emotes, and highlight intros cost currency. There are two primary currencies that hold essentially the same value, The gold one is called Lattice, which can be bought with real money, and the blue one is called a Unit, which can be earned by playing and completing challenges. Lattice can be exchanged 1:1 for Units, with $1 USD equating to 100 Lattice. You can only purchase Lattice in bundles, meaning you might have to overshoot to pay for something cheaper. I bought the Star-Lord <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>costume, which cost 1800 Units, but the only bundle that would cover the cost was the $20 Lattice bundle. So just keep that in mind as you navigate buying in-game currency. Beyond those, there are also Chrono Tokens used specifically to unlock battle pass rewards that you’ll gain through events and tasks.</p><h2 id="h155894"><a id=""></a><strong>The battle pass is not time-gated</strong></h2><p>Speaking of battle passes, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is taking the FOMO out of its Luxury Battle Passes by allowing you to unlock their contents at any point as long as you purchase them during the season. The pass itself costs 490 Lattices and contains costumes and other cosmetic items. So if you plan on playing <em>Marvel Rivals </em>long-term and want to unlock everything in the battle pass but might have to take a break every now and then, you can just buy the battle pass and come back to it whenever you feel like it.</p><h2 id="h155895"><a id=""></a><strong>Here’s a free Iron Man skin</strong></h2><p>If you’re reading this before March 5, 2025, NetEase is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giving out a free Iron Man skin</a></span>. Redeem the code nwarh4k3xqy in-game and deck out Tony Stark in the black-and-gold Armor Model 42.</p><h2 id="h155896"><a id=""></a><strong>Team-ups can give you an edge, but don’t feel pressured to pick heroes solely for them</strong></h2><p>One of the big distinguishing features of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is Team-Up abilities. These give certain heroe combinations an extra ability that can give you an advantage in a fight. Some are an extra ability in your back pocket like Adam Warlock giving Mantis and Star-Lord a second life, while others like Rocket and Jeff riding on Groot’s back and losing their independent movement in exchange for increased defense will fundamentally change how you play in some ways. These are great when they come up naturally and building your team composition around them is a good tactic. However, they are not the end-all-be-all of strategy in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Plenty of matches can be won without characters who are artificially meant to work better together. It’s all about reading the situation you’re in and sticking with characters you can play well enough to defeat the enemy team.</p><h2 id="h155897"><a id=""></a><strong>Be flexible</strong></h2><p>This rich coming from a Star-Lord one-trick. But do as I say, not as I do. Switching heroes is key to games like <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>, but it’s very easy to get stuck on one character you really mesh with. However, if you’re losing a match and just can’t seem to get the upper hand, it might be time to switch. Part of the toxicity that permeates these games is the insistence that someone else on the team should switch off who they’re playing and a toxic player couldn’t possibly be the problem. The truth is, sometimes it’s not about player skill, some heroes are just not built for every situation. If the enemy team is playing Black Widow, having a bunch of airborne heroes she can easily clip the wings of is not going to win you the fight no matter how good you are. You can have your main, but take time to learn at least a few characters you can possibly swap to in a pinch.</p><h2 id="h155898"><a id=""></a><strong>You don’t need to cover every role, but you should always have a healer</strong></h2><p>Role spread is another contentious topic in hero shooters, as some fans like having the flexibility to create team compositions that don’t have to adhere to an equal 2-2-2 formation. At the moment, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t have a role queue that forces the team to pick two of each (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist), but having at least one of each is a decent rule of thumb when deciding who to play. I had a team who was three duelists and three strategists and we did fine, though. However, the key role in all of this that you should make sure you have at least one (preferably more) of is the Strategist. Straight up, you’re not gonna win fights against a decent enemy team if you don’t have someone who can heal your teammates, and if the randos you group up with are unwilling to do so and you want any chance of winning, maybe consider swapping to one yourself. Yeah, that sometimes means you’ll end up babysitting, but if there’s no one to play the medic, nothing’s going to get done.</p><h2 id="h155899"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t trickle in</strong></h2><p>When you’re lost in the sauce and running on adrenaline after a chaotic fight, it’s easy to run out of spawn to try to get back in the scrap. Trouble is, if you and all your five teammates are doing that but aren’t dying at the same time, you’ll end up trickling in one by one for the enemy team to pick off as you enter their line of sight. If you and your team aren’t all grouped up and pushing an objective as a unit, you’ll get nowhere. Always try to move as a group, and if you are trying to lone-wolf it, make sure you have a plan like flanking the enemy team or surprising them with an ultimate.</p><h2 id="h155900"><a id=""></a><strong>Ultimate charge carries between rounds</strong></h2><p>One of the nice differences between <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Overwatch </em>is that Ultimate charge transfers between rounds. This means if you had your Ultimate ready to go or at least close to it in one round, you’ll still have the same percentage when the next round start. As an <em>Overwatch </em>player, it became a habit to use an ult at the end of a round because I might as well hear a cool voice line. It was almost celebratory on a winning round. I did that once in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>on launch night and realized I’d completely forgotten that I’d still have it when the loading screen between rounds was done. So use that to your advantage, as it can give you head start as you and the enemy team descend onto the next point.</p><h2 id="h155901"><a id=""></a><strong>For your sanity’s sake, group up with friends</strong></h2><p>This is a general good idea for most team-based multiplayer games. Grab at least a friend or two before you head online. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is a pretty chaotic game, even with a team of people on voice chat, and thus far I’ve had even less luck solo queuing than I typically have in <em>Overwatch</em>. I’ve always believed the notion of one person carrying in a team-based game to be a power fantasy that is rarely achievable, but it feels especially difficult to pull off in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>right now. Maybe matches will become more lopsided as players learn the game, but for now, try to find people you can coordinate with. You’ll have a much better experience that way.</p><hr><p>We’ll have a full review of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>up in the coming days, but for now, here’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-beta-impressions-preview-overwatch-1851610920">our thoughts</a></span> on how NetEase’s comic book hero shooter stands against its obvious inspiration.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each turn (usually) lets you take two grabs, with those two lots of retrieved items used to attack and defend between enemy turns. Via that <em>Slay The Spire</em> model, you then choose map directions, and thus enter event rooms, literal gacha machine treasure spots, upgrade shops, and many other fights.</p><p>That’s the basics, but what makes <em>Dungeon Clawler</em> quite so interesting—beyond the central gimmick being ridiculously hooky (pun so bloody intended)—is that the Early Access game goes to so many other involving places, with a huge pile of novel twists and ideas. For instance, there’s water, and there’s honey. If honey gets into the large container, then swords and throwing stars and golden shields and poisonous knives will all get stuck together, which is great for getting a bunch of stuff at once, but bad if it’s too heavy for the claw and you get nothing. Then water (and other liquids) can fill the tank and dissolve the glue but make items usefully float at the top, and indeed fill weapons like sponges and water pistols, which is especially good if you poison the water in there…</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Certain items are more powerful if gathered entirely alone, which makes you want to be more delicate with the claw, but giant handfuls of stuff at once can be a match-winner. You can upgrade items, making them more powerful, but also they can get bigger and so harder to pick up, so you’ll want to grab an ability that causes items to shrink. You can transmute items to have different material properties, such that wooden swords can become metallic and thus magnetic… And on and on and on. There are so many excellent details, letting you adjust your plans based on what you can gather, offering far more sophistication than the initial simple premise suggests.</p><p>So much of this is thanks to the excellent physics. They exude fairness, items flinging and clattering around in a way that makes natural sense, meaning you can have really good instincts about where to drop the claw, and when to close the pincers—and indeed why something might slip out or fly off, without feeling like you’ve been cheated.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-recommend-id="image://b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Stray Fawn Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-recommend-id="image://b7328209f9c4916a835b0ef6aaf3c446" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three enemies take on our bunny hero, all standing in front of the vast claw machine tank." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right now, weeks into its Early Access, it already feels incredibly complete. However, there’s a good amount of balancing that needs doing. There are all manner of characters to play as, with unique starting conditions—bonus shield at the cost of health, for instance, or water-based skills for the loss of other abilities—and they unlock quickly and encourage experimentation, but pretty much all of them can hit the same brick wall of a particular enemy type. There’s one foe who doubles his damage each turn, and so without a particularly aggressive build, it’s pretty much game over if you encounter him too early; there’s just little chance you have shields at a point where you can cope. That sucks. He’s not alone in terms of being too OP, too early in a run, which is disappointing.</p><p>Yet, I play again. And again. And again. Unlike real-world claw machines, which are essentially a con designed to make small children miserable, here it’s a far more rewarding experience. The claws <em>are</em> weak, and so won’t hold a massive pile of large items, and they <em>do</em> swing wildly such that many an item will fly off as it lurches to the dropping area. But it’s not <em>fixed</em>, and there’s a strong sense of skill as well as luck in what you gather.</p><p>With a bit of tweaking to difficulty, it’d be hard to fault <em>Dungeon Clawler</em>. It absolutely mimics a million games that came before it, but the combination of a unique mechanic <em>and</em> so many interesting innovations of its own within the format means a game I figured would be just “that idea but with a claw machine” (which sounded good to me!) is actually something far more rounded, involving, and interesting in its own right. I just need to figure out how to stop playing. (Oh god, no, now I’m installing it on my phone…)</p><p><em>This article originally appeared on </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buried Treasure</a></span>, <em>a site dedicated to unearthing lesser-known indie games.

The company itself is eager to suggest as much, writing that Genie 2 can "generate a vast diversity of rich 3D worlds" with emergent capabilities such as "object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Below (as pictured) are example videos of people interacting with Genie 2. For every example, the model is prompted with a single image generated by&nbsp;Imagen 3, GDM’s state-of-the-art text-to-image model," says the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This means anyone can describe a world they want in text, select their favorite rendering of that idea, and then step into and interact with that newly created world (or have an AI agent be trained or evaluated in it). At each step, a person or agent provides a keyboard and mouse action, and Genie 2 simulates the next observation. Genie 2 can generate consistent worlds for up to a minute, with the majority of examples shown lasting 10-20s."</span></p><p>Image via Google</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The examples selected by Google to showcase its new model are uniform in their sterility. Character models wander vapid interpretations of forests and deserts, scarcely populated with structures and foliage looped on repeat. Pyramids that bend and warp as the camera swings overhead. A forest of trees echoing ad infinitum.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Emergent interactions take the form of basic movements and character animations that flatter to deceive. The short clips shared by Google (which presumably elected to showcase only the finest Genie 2 outputs) feature bland facsimiles of vaguely familiar video game scenarios that quickly fragment and decay when placed under any sort of scrutiny.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Genie 2 generates new plausible content on the fly and maintains a consistent world for up to a minute," states Google. This sentence is not the ringing endorsement the company thinks it is.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Google and other AI companies fail to understand the act of creation">Google and other AI companies fail to understand the act of creation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers (and creatives cut from any cloth) do not aspire to create "plausible content."

To create anything is to send fragments of yourself into the eternal aether, hoping that someone, somewhere, will find meaning in the deliberate, unpredictable, collaborative mess that art so often becomes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Google evidently doesn't understand </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers make games, either. There's intentionality behind every single decision, whether it's designing an open-world in service of pacing or mechanics–or baking your narrative into the very fabric of the environment. These are not elements you can simply conjure into being with a string of text or AI-generated image.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Genie 2 is a blunt instrument lacking precision or purpose. Google has spent time and resources creating a tool that can scarcely reproduce the most cliched examples of video game guff. A blurry neon city. Fantasy man on horse. Now, it must convince us the crumbling husks churned out by Genie 2 are worthy of our time and attention. Let's be clear: they are not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, they're barely even viable. Google itself has admitted the model is only capable of maintaining consistent worlds for less than a minute. It's like watching the memory of a memory swirling the cosmic drain. There is only degradation and collapse–</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/google-ai-emissions">presumably at great real-world cost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/02/google-ai-emissions">via The Guardian</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who is all this for? Based on what Google has showcased here, players dreaming of eventually blinking their own games into reality with the help of AI tools will quickly realize their 'creations' are devoid of both style and substance. Two aspects of video games that are unmistakably human.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers, meanwhile, have already shown how existing technologies such as procedural generation can be used make entire galaxies corporeal. Robust asset stores exist for those in need of pre-made building blocks to assist with rapid prototyping or full blown production. Engines like Unity, Unreal, Godot, and GameMaker continue to cater to the needs of developers at all levels–while some might choose to build their own from the ground up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If AI tools like Genie 2 are the solution, what is the problem?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era of layoffs, studio closures, financial upheaval, and mass conglomeration, the biggest challenge facing developers is finding the resources needed to unlock their creativity in a way that feels sustainable. In an industry that's becoming increasingly risk-averse and insular at the top level, developers need those with the deepest wallets to start taking chances on new ideas instead of trying (and so often failing) to replicate the successes of their competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forget about churning out plausible content. Give developers what they need to pull their most abstract, ambitious ideas into reality.

		<p><em>We've been a bit sports-centric lately at Remap lately, albeit some of it against our will. We knew the Chicago Bears would garner a lot of attention this season, but we didn't anticipate it would look like...this. </em></p><p><em>This is our burden, our curse, and we're glad (??) to share it with you. It's always a treat to check Bluesky and seeing countless people doing sicko mode, hoping we'll record a podcast about yet another Chicago Bears misery event. Fortunately for you, we've obliged.</em></p><p><em>We don't always watch the Chicago Bears! Arguably, we shouldn't! But you watch enough sports for enough years that you start to develop really strong thoughts about how you're watching those sports, too.</em></p><p><em>You know Rob is on one when he randomly sends Patrick a link to a Google Docs page with several hundreds words strongly engaging with the format of a football television broadcast. </em></p><p><em>What else do you think we started Remap for?</em> </p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Now Patrick, you <em>know</em> I hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon Web Services <em>BUT: </em>I have to hand it to them: Thursday Night Football is the best broadcast in sports right now.</p><p>There are critiques you can level against it: the games are frequently bad, a problem that has dogged Thursday Night Football since the NFL started pushing it as a way to get more games into primetimes TV programming. By definition a Thursday night game is out-of-sync with the regular rhythm of an NFL season, and most of the times the teams playing it will be on short rest and reduced prep time, which makes for scrappier and less well-played games. Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit are not the most dynamic commentary duo, though I think most of the issues there is actually down to the fact that Herbstreit is about as workmanlike a color analyst as you can get.</p><p>But here’s the thing: TNF on Amazon is the only new NFL product in years that has rivaled or even surpassed Sunday Night Football on NBC. It’s sent out in HDR with a decent 1080 bitrate, which makes it visibly better-looking than any game I get through broadcast networks, a taste of what sports could and should look like if anyone had any incentive to make a better product. The audio mix is awesome, with calls at the line being audible alongside some detailed crowd noise (like the rattling bleachers at the Browns stadium in the snow game there a couple weeks ago). They are terrific at getting great asides, like Jameis Winston’s incredible pre-game speech before leading his team out against the Steelers, where he gets into a good rhythm and realizes he lost his point, so backtracks and clarifies what he meant, all without breaking his “tent revival preacher” persona.&nbsp;</p><p>So far that’s all just a normal football broadcast with a bit more attention to detail. But the thing that really differentiates it is the alternate broadcast, billed as Prime Vision with Next Gen Stats. It’s pitched as the broadcast for stats nerds (which is itself nice given how much gambling lines have overtaken statistical analysis in sports broadcast graphics) where analysis and AI work together to highlight key parts of the game. But the really nice feature of this broadcast is that uses <em>Madden</em>-style spotlighting on key personnel, which makes it <em>way </em>easier to see receiver and pass rusher groupings before the play, and it uses camera angles that give you a better look at football than any other broadcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the time the Prime Vision broadcast uses a wider shot akin to the beloved All-22, where you can see the whole field of play at once, which is the only way for modern football to be comprehensible given the way the passing game has become the cornerstone of the whole league. But they’ve also leaned hard on an overhead angle this year that lets you see the play almost from the perspective of the whiteboard play diagram where every football play is born. As someone who loves watching line play, that angle is the only one that really lets you see how the defense brings pressure and how the offense tries (or fails) to counter it. Crucially, it also really lets you see how critical it is to open up sightlines for the quarterback, which is an aspect of the game that totally gets lost in the side-on view most broadcasts use.</p><p>Amazon is the only player in the sports space that seems to have really thought about how you can present a match in a modern context. Maybe some of their approach was influenced by their need to do a dog-and-pony show for AWS and the various enhancements “AI” can supposedly make to everyday tasks, but it does seem like that brief led them to a novel and more thoughtful production. It really highlights how small and unambitious most of the other broadcasters are in their thinking.

In other sports, replays are important for, say, trying to understand an injury or why a flag was thrown.

You watch as the camera jerks towards the action and buddy, I’m chuckling the whole time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s actually kinda interesting how little has changed between the origins of NFL broadcasting and now?</p><p>I mean, check out one of the first broadcast NFL games.

<p>In the early 2000s, Sony faced a new competitor to its PlayStation business when Microsoft launched the original Xbox. With that new competition sparked a genuine concern from Sony that led to them getting exclusive release rights to the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games of the era for the PlayStation 2.</p>



<p>Chris Deering, the former president of PlayStation Europe, recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz,</a> and shed some light as to why  PlayStation wanted an exclusive agreement for GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.</p>



<p>“We were worried when we saw Xbox coming,” Deering said. “We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, ‘How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?’ And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn’t clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game.”</p>



<p>Deering added that PlayStation was “lucky” with the deal because of how it paid off for the company. </p>



<p>“It was very lucky for us,” he said. “And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid.”</p>







<p>The games ultimately saw a release on Xbox, but not before they became the best-selling games in the history of PS2. San Andreas became the best-selling PS2 game ever while the other two games, Vice City and GTA 3, became the third- and fifth-best selling games.</p>



<p>GTA 3 and Vice City released on Xbox on November 4, 2003 while San Andreas came to Xbox in June 2005.</p>

The year-long wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images">counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory">bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</a>, and even registration plates as they hunt for GTA 6 clues. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1 last December, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, is a big fan of all the fuss, taking to <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his YouTube channel</a> to explain that the developers at Rockstar will be getting a kick out of it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"All the developers over there are geeking out about it, trust me," he said. "When I was over there I would have little conversations with people and be like, ‘Did you hear this person found this mystery?’ And they’d go, ‘Oh yeah!’ "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York also suggested that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Rockstar actually be placing clues to things like trailer release dates in GTA Online images, as the moon theory has suggested? Probably not, York said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of these things are like trolls,” he added. “It’s a mystery to nowhere. It’s just to have you dig in there and search for stuff and find it. And even though it won’t lead to something, it’s something that can bring a chase and a journey and an adventure for all these players for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a developer, it was really cool to sit down and look at these comments that people leave and these conspiracy theories that they come up with, because a lot of them are super elaborate, and they take a lot of time to come up with. It really goes to show the passion behind all these fans behind this franchise, because these people are taking hours and hours and hours out of their day to try to go after these theories, and it’s really fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The company’s next big game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, was delayed into 2025, and Star Wars Outlaws failed to meet sales expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, Ubisoft shareholders are “considering” how to structure a possible buyout of the French company without reducing the founding Guillemot family’s control. The Guillemot family is the largest shareholder in Ubisoft and is reportedly in talks with Tencent and “other investors” as it seeks funding a management buyout. Tencent is the second-largest shareholder in Ubisoft with 10% and, according to Reuters, has yet to decide whether to fund the buyout.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/gettyimages-2179673307-1733497661112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to 2025. Photo by Dimitar DILKOFF / AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reuters said Tencent’s indecision is “partly because it has asked for a greater say on future board decisions including cash flow distribution in return for financing the deal.” Apparently the Guillemot family has yet to agree to those terms, but Tencent is willing to wait for them to come around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, with a Guillemot family rep failing to respond. But a Ubisoft spokesperson did comment, saying: "We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it made a series of dramatic announcements around the performance of its games. As well as delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft announced a return to Steam after a period of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, with Star Wars Outlaws recently releasing on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest news comes hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">Ubisoft's announcement that it plans to shut down Call of Duty competitor XDefiant</a> and its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka while ramping down its site in Sydney, with up to 277 employees losing their jobs. Roughly half of the XDefiant team will be assigned roles elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shares in Ubisoft are up 12.52% today, December 6, following the Tencent buyout reports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
