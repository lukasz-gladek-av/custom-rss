            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/psvr-2-gets-a-big-permanent-price-cut/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced a big price cut for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a>, dropping the recommended retail price of the of the VR headset starting in March.</p>
<p>The same two SKUs for PSVR 2 will still be on offer – a base edition that includes the PSVR 2 headset, PSVR 2 Sense controllers and some earbuds, and a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle that adds a digital download code for the game – and they will now have the exact same price.</p>


<p>The new RRP for PSVR will be $399.99 (pre-tax) / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty significant drop of $150 / €150 / £130 for the standard set, and $200 / €200 / £170 for the game bundle – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/psvr-2-price-cut-by-a-whopping-200-180-for-a-limited-time/">this matches the promotions from last summer</a>, as they were gearing up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the release of the PSVR 2 PC adapter</a>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps indicative of where PSVR 2 is as a product. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch have all gone without any price cuts since the start of this generation. In fact, they’ve actually become more expensive over time, even when shrunken down, simplified versions of these consoles have launched,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/"> like with the PS5 Slim</a>.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the PSVR 2 PC adapter last year, dropping the price permanently could spur on some sales, with speculation and insider whispers that Sony has struggled to shift the hardware – there’s also been rumours that Apple might like to co-opt the Sense controllers for Apple Vision Pro compatibility, though these are not sold separately and any plans have yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Sony has noted that recent updates for PSVR 2 have added low-latency hand tracking, which lets you put the controllers down and play using your hands and fingers, the PSVR 2 headset mapping out their positions using the tracking cameras ordinarily used for following the Sense controllers. This is supported with the recently updated Waltz of the Wizard:</p>
<p><iframe title="Waltz of the Wizard - Hand Tracking Update Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXtR7_4IdaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All in all, this could make PSVR 2 a shade more appealing – it not longer quite costs more than a PS5 (with disc drive), for example – and the PC VR support is excellent, opening up broader access to VR gaming and with the reassuring longevity that PC gaming provides.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/metro-developer-4a-games-ukraine-rebrands-as-reburn-why-how-and-does-4a-games-still-exist/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Independent developer 4A Games Ukraine has rebranded as Reburn and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/la-quimera-is-a-new-sci-fi-shooter-from-the-metro-devs-and-nicolas-winding-refn/">announced their new sci-fi IP La Quimera</a>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they’ve done this, and how, when 4A Games and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro">Metro</a> series are both owned by Embracer Group. Well, it’s because what has generally been referred to as 4A Games is actually two companies: 4A Games Malta which is owned by Embracer, and 4A Games Ukraine (now Reburn), which is independent.</p>


<p>It makes absolute sense that, now that they are launching a new IP, Reburn needs to stake out a new identity for itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s plenty of scope for confusion here, and there is still some fuzzy grey areas in the understanding of the timelines and the financial transactions that took place over the past decade. We’ll seek to clear this up through this article.</p>

<p>In essence, 4A Games was founded in 2006 by a core group of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> developers striking out from GSC Game Worlds. In 2014, with the first wave of the Russian-backed uprisings in Eastern Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, some of the team, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/4a-games-opens-new-malta-studio">including creative director and co-founder Andrew Prokhorov and CTO Oles Shyshkovtsov</a>, left the country and set up a new studio in Malta – 4A Games Malta. Both studios could use the 4A Games trademark, share the 4A Engine, and develop <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">Metro Exodus</a> together. In public statements, the Malta studio was referred to as the headquarters for 4A Games, with the Kyiv studio</p>
<p>Where things get muddled is in August 2020. At that time, Embracer (who already held the Metro IP via Koch Media) acquired “4A Games”, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games/">announcing in the press release</a> that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> would be the new parent company for the 150+ members “across two studios in Malta and Ukraine”. Despite the last two years of instability for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a>, “4A Games” and the Metro IP are still held by the company.</p>
<p>However, the timeline according to Reburn is that Embracer only acquired 4A Games Malta in 2020. Separately in the same year, 4A Games Ukraine received additional investment and started work on their new IP La Quimera. At a later date, and to prevent future confusion, they have decided to leave the 4A Games trademark with the Malta-based studio and rebrand as Reburn.</p>
<p>It’s a quietly remarkable story for how unremarkable it actually is, outside of scratching our heads how Embracer didn’t actually acquire the Ukraine studio. There’s no big wave of layoffs, no exodus of developers, and both studios can proudly share their legacy of working on the Metro series. This is perhaps conceptually similar to how Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin created <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/10/08/dishonored-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Dishonored</a> together and then started working on separate projects.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, both Reburn and 4A Games will be able to use the 4A Engine. While Reburn has now announced La Quimera, 4A Malta’s next game is still under wraps – the most recent game in the Metro series was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro: Awakening VR</a>, developed and self-published by Vertigo Games, and we know that a new Metro is in the works.</p>

The hail from all different genres and teams, and range from very good to absolutely terrible. Steam is normally a mess to browse, and Next Fest is the usual discoverability labyrinth on steroids. So we’ve been playing stuff to see what has that special spark. Here are some of the games we’ve been enjoying and mesmerized by from Steam’s latest free demo bonanza. </p></div><div><p>Kathy Rain is finally back, eight years after her last, fantastic adventure. She’s now working full-time as a PI, but it’s not going well, money is about to run out, and she’s betting everything on solving a series of local murders by a serial killer called The Soothsayer. The demo gives a good chunk of game, and some excellent puzzles. — John Walker </p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>If you thought Steamboat Willie’s entering the public domain was just going to secure you a few terrible horror movies, think again. It’s also going to score one of the most astonishingly disturbing games I’ve ever played. And I’m pretty sure it’s good? <em>Bad Cheese</em>’s demo is a monstrously upsetting first-person...something, in which you play a bloated, morbidly obese Mickey Mouse, desperately trying to find pills for his mutant dog-like father-creature. Oh god, even the sound effects make me curl up to remember. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>This twin-stick shooter does more interesting things in its demo than so many games offer in their entirety. It’s a game where your health bars are also your ammo, so attacking makes you vulnerable, and that’s a damned fine idea alone. Then it gets more complicated. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>Bad Cheese</em> isn’t the only disturbing black-and-white demo we’ve found this Next Fest. <em>Kiddo</em> is a monochrome point-and-click adventure in which you play a masked figure who lives in disgusting solitude, finally spurred to leave his couch by the disappearance of his dog. In the demo, you’re mostly focused on trying to clean the toilet. And it’s <em>so</em> good. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>Race around collecting golden gears and other stuff in a beautiful seaside world where you surf around with the flare and ease of an animated ‘90s cereal mascot. <em>Demon Tides</em> is a follow-up to<em> Demon Turf: Neon Splash</em>. There are only about five short levels in the demo so it’s only a taste, but I already want more. I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, I mean <em>Demon Tides</em>.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p>Set in Quito, Ecuador in 2001, <em>Despelote</em> is an urban walking sim where you learn about a neighborhood and its residents by kicking a soccer ball around. Its collage art-style is evocative, the music is beautiful, and the dream-like exploration of someone else’s mundane memories is affecting and hard to shake. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>May 1, 2025</p></div><div><p>Colorful, fast-paced parkour in a whimsical world that’s constantly falling apart around you. That’s <em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> in a nutshell, a very neat action platformer that can feel like a mashup of <em>Sonic</em> and a Studio Ghibli movie. I love it. One YouTube comment put it best. “They <em>actually</em> made the ‘Awesome Parkour Guy You Watched Out The Back Seat Car Window When You Were a Kid’ game.” — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD</p></div><div><p><em>Mashina </em>is a stop-motion strategy sim where you play a robot digging through the earth to harvest resources and repair the world around you using machines. Think stripped-down elements of <em>Minecraft</em> and<em> Factorio</em> wrapped around a cute, child-like adventure. The demo is super short and gave me <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> vibes (complimentary), and the mixed-media visual style is top-notch.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p><em>Is This Seat Taken</em> is the perfect kind of puzzle game. It has a simple setup—sort out differently-shaped people correctly—and so excellently and confidently nails that premise that playing it feels like someone injecting dopamine directly into your brain. I burned through the demo so fast that I was sad I have to now wait to play the full game. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>XCOM </em>creator Julian Gollop isn’t what you might expect. <em>Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> is a third-person shooter tower defense strategy game that features colorful visuals and large open maps to explore. It’s like someone mixed together<em> Ratchet and Clank</em> with <em>Orcs Must Die</em> and added a tactical vision mode, too. Sounds a bit odd, but it’s really fun and feels great even in this unfinished state. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> is pitched as a turn-based beat’em up and while that sounded strange, after playing the new demo, I’m totally in. This new <em>TMNT </em>game is turn-based, sure, but moves fast thanks to the fact that every few turns part of the map falls away. So you are forced to keep moving through crowds of enemies and use each turtle’s unique abilities to fight while picking up pizza for health. It’s a little harder than I expected, but I think this is something special. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You may not have access to all of them every game, as they each have specific unlock requirements, but no matter how many options you're dealing with, our Civ 7 Exploration civs tier list can help you make that crucial decision.</p><div id="best-civ-7-exploration-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Civ 7 Exploration Civs Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S-tier</strong> - Mongolia, Shawnee, Norman</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A-tier</strong> - Chola, Ming</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B-tier</strong> - Abbassid, Hawai’i, Inca, Songhai</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C-tier</strong> - Majapahit, Spain</p><h2 data-cy="title2">S-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the best of the best Civilization 7 has to offer. Whether it's their particularly strong military units, or their very powerful resource access, you can largely dominate maps with these choices. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-mongolia-1740591019889.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Mongolia</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Bokh</strong> - When you capture an opposing Settlement gain the strongest Cavalry Unit you can train, but -50% Production towards training Settlers.

There’s nothing here that’s flashy, but as a show of brute strength, you will become the bully of a map when taking control of Mongolia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One interesting thing about Mongolia is that it directly feeds into the Military Legacy Path by providing boosts for the Non Sufficit Orbis path. The more you take as well, the stronger your army grows with Cavalry, so you can snowball maps pretty hard, especially with the Keshig and Noyan adding extra firepower. If you are planning to go for a Military victory, Mongolia is a direct path to get there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-shawnee-1740591086661.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Shawnee</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Nepekifaki - </strong>Settlements built adjacent to Navigable Rivers gain +2 Food on River Terrain, but Cities not built adjacent to a Navigable River receive -10% Food. +30% Production towards constructing Serpent Mound.</li><li><strong>Kispoko Nena’to - </strong>Shawnee Unique Infantry Unit. +1 Combat Strength for every unique Empire Resource.</li><li><strong>Hoceepkileni - </strong>Shawnee Unique Missionary. +1 Movement and Rivers do not end movement.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shawnee unique trait of Nepekifaki is easy to keep active, as most Settlements will likely end up being built around rivers. By doing so, you will get a nice boost of Food, helping your population grow, and allowing you to grab even more land. You have to avoid having cities not on Navigable Rivers, but even in cases where you have a Town not on one, you can just leave it as a Town. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the Kispoko Nena’to could become one of the strongest Infantry in the game under the right circumstances. If you get your hands on multiple Unique Resources, they will become very, very strong. This makes Shawnee a military force to be reckoned with, but also one that will be expanding its borders through population growth too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-norman-1740591108659.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Norman</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Normannitas</strong> - Land Units receive +1 Movement when Embarked and Land Units adjacent to Coast receive +5 Combat Strength. +30% Production towards constructing the White Tower.</li><li><strong>Chevaler </strong>- Norman Unique Cavalry Unit. +3 Combat Strength against slower Units.

Land Units receiving +1 movement when embarked is going to be super useful when trying to get a foothold in Distant Lands. Not only will you be able to get Settlers over faster, but you can move your Military Units quicker so you won’t be defenseless after you arrive. This makes them very nimble during this Age, which is surprisingly valuable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are also supported by a very good Cavalry Unit in the Chevaler, which will be strong against armies that rely heavily on Infantry units. By just creating the Unique District, the Donjon, you’ll get free one of those units, making the Normans a military force to be feared. On top of this, the Sokeman Army Commander gives new Towns automatic City walls, which feed into both the power of the Bailey and Motte. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-chola-1740591143557.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Chola</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Samayam</strong> - +1 Trade Route from the Improve Trade Relations Action. +30 % Production towards constructing the Brihadeeswarar Temple.</li><li><strong>Kalam</strong> - Chola Unique Naval Unit. +1 additional attack per turn if movement allows.</li><li><strong>Ottru</strong> - Chola Unique Naval Commander.

Kalam can attack twice in many instances, while the Ottru debuffs enemy units too. When used in tandem, there’s not many who will be able to withstand a sea-based assault like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chola also get access to a lot of Trade buffs, increasing the number of Trade Routes they can establish, and also their radius. You should be able to build quite a treasury and maintain decent relations with other civilizations with this. That said, the Chola will struggle to keep up with Science, so pacts will be important to stay relevant. On top of that, they are also not a civilization to pick if you ended up building a very landlocked empire in the Antiquity Age, as access to coasts is fairly essential. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-ming-1740591174599.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Ming</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Great Canon of Yongle</strong> - +50% Science in the Capital. -15 Science per turn for each Social Policy, but not Tradition, slotted. +30% Production towards constructing the Forbidden City.</li><li><strong>Xunleich</strong> - Ming Unique Infantry Unit. +4 Combat Strength in Featureless tiles.

With some careful management, they can absolutely run away with technological advances in the Exploration Era, as they get a straight 50% buff to all Science in your Capital. However, you can end up hurting yourself. You get -15 Science for every Social Policy, so you will want to lean on Tradition wherever possible. If you manage this, though, the benefits are enormous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ming Great Wall is a versatile building offering great fortification defense, as well as Culture and Gold. The Mandarin is also a great unit for a quick burst of Gold when building Roads, and while not the strongest military unit in the Age, the Xunleichong is a good option if you can station them on featureless terrain. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">B-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In this tier, you'll find good civilizations with a decent amount of benefits. They're generally strong, and may be situationally extremely powerful, but tend to be more specialized. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-abbasid-1740591204160.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Abbassid</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Madina</strong> - Receive 30 Gold for each Rural Population of the City when you create a Specialist.

But to get these benefits, you’re going to need to manage your Settlements and properly set them up. You get 30 Gold for each Rural Population of a city whenever you create a specialist. You can also boost Science quite a lot by completing the Ulema District, providing +1 Science for all Specialists in the city. The Mamluk are also decent and can become quite powerful defensively. The Cavalry gains +1 Combat Strength for every Urban population in a Settlement while stationed there.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This civilization is an excellent option if you’re confident in producing and placing Specialists while managing districts. However, if you’re less confident in how these mechanics work, many other, plug-in-and-play civilizations require less finessing. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-hawaii-1740591239769.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Hawai’i</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Moananuiakea</strong> - Gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands to Marine Terrain.+1 Happiness on Fishing Boats. +30% Production towards constructing Hale o Keawe.</li><li><strong>Leiomano</strong> - Hawaiian Unique Infantry Unit. +3 Combat Strength against Infantry and Cavalry Units.

Considering the Exploration Age is all about getting in your boats and finding Distant Lands, this can synergise nicely. The Moananuiakea trait means you gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands in Marine Terrain. You’ll also get +1 Happiness on Fishing Boats. Neither is an enormous buff, but if you can incorporate a lot of sea into your borders, this will undoubtedly add up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the Leiomano is a very solid Infantry unit, getting a +3 combat buff against Infantry and Cavalry Units. Considering that’s the majority of land units they will be going up against, it’s just a nice edge that doesn’t require a complex initiation. The Lo’i Kalo is also just a solid producer of Food, Production, and Culture in most cases, making it a versatile building. There’s nothing particularly flashy or hard to use about Hawai’i past just being on a coast, but the civilization has a nice slew of solid benefits that are easy to get consistent value out of. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-inca-1740591264663.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Inca</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Apus</strong> - Can work Mountain Terrain. +2 Food and +1 Production on Mountain Terrain. +30% Production towards constructing Machu Pikchu.</li><li><strong>Warak’q</strong> - Incan Unique Ranged Unit .

Choosing this civilization is best if you’ve built your borders with them in mind in the Antiquity Age. This is because their power comes from utilizing mountain tiles. If you built your cities around big ranges though, you will get a lot from the Incas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This civilization lets you work Mountain terrain, and get extra food and production when doing so. On top of that, the Terrace Farm improvement is just a significant +6 to Food, meaning you will be able to expand your borders even faster. The Chasqui scout is also great for exploring Distant Lands, getting extra movement, and ignoring mountains and rough terrain, allowing you to chart new continents really fast. That all said, if you don’t have a lot of mountains within your lands, you’re going to be missing out on a lot of value, making them quite situational. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-songhai-1740591293254.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Songhai</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Tarikh al-Sudan</strong> - +2 Resource Capacity in Cities on Navigable Rivers and your Trade Ships cannot be Plundered on Navigable Rivers. +30% Production towards constructing the Tomb of Askia.</li><li><strong>Gold Bangles Infantry</strong> - Songhai Unique Infantry Unit. +5 Combat Strength on Resource tiles. +100% Gold from pillaging Trade Routes.</li><li><strong>Tajio</strong> - Songhai Unique Merchant.

Songhai Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be built on Desert or Plains.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Songhai are all about making money. If you’re looking to make Gold, this Civilization will do it for you - that said, it’s relatively one-dimensional. The Tarikh al-Sudan trait that gives them +2 Resource Capacity in Cities on Navigable Rivers is nice as those slots do come at a premium. Also, the Caravanserai improvement as well as the Tajiro merchant are very good Gold generators. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, there is no real variety here. Other yields like Influence, Happiness, Culture, and Science might struggle. Of course, you can buy these buildings in towns with all your Gold, but expect some difficulty keeping up with everyone else. Also, the Gold Bangles Infantry, which gets +5 combat on Resource tiles, is a decent defensive option if you set up like that specifically, but considering you’re at the whims of the map, and not your Settlement placement, it can be a little awkward to utilise fully.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">C-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not bad civilizations, these are often more situational civilizations or civilizations that require a unique playstyle that might be best for more experienced players. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-majapahit-1740591322798.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Majapahit</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Negara</strong> - All Cities except the Capital receive +1 Specialist Limit.

Ageless.</li><li><strong>Candi Bentar</strong> - +5 Culture. +1 Culture Adjacency for Coastal Terrain, Navigable Rivers, and Wonders. Majapahit Unique Culture Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Majapahit are a decent choice if you live in a relatively varied landscape. The Meru provides Happiness on Mountains, Wonders, and even more on Natural Wonders. The Candi Bentar is a great producer of Culture on Coasts, Rivers and Wonders. That said, it can be hard to really incorporate all of that, and even if you build the Pura district by combining both, receiving 1 relic isn’t often going to tip the scales for you. On top of that, the Negara does let you have an extra Specialist, but again, this likely isn’t going to be a massive deciding factor for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Majapahit is not without merit. Altogether, it can be a decent producer of Culture if the circumstances are right, and if you get more Puras it can be a decent source of Relics. The Cetband Navel unit is excellent too, getting +5 combat strength against enemy Naval Units is strong in an Age when a lot of sailing is happening. That said, the Majaphat lack a little cohesiveness, and can be a touch situational, making it tougher to get full value out of them at all times.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-spain-1740591360664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Spain</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Siglo de Oro - </strong>+15% Gold towards converting a Town to a City, or +30% in Distant Lands. +30% Production towards constructing El Escorial.</li><li><strong>Tercio - </strong>Spanish Unique Infantry Unit. Has a higher Combat Strength. Adjacent Units receive +3 Combat Strength against Cavalry Units (bonus is only applied once.)</li><li><strong>Conquistador - </strong>A Great Person with one charge.

Spanish Unique Gold Building. Ageless. Must be built in the Homelands.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Spain is not a bad civilization by any means. They provide a lot of avenues for Gold, with the Plaza Quarters being a big source of it if you make a lot of Settlements in Distant Lands. However, outside of that, and considering a couple of other Civilizations have access to powerful Gold-generating facets, there’s not much that really sets Spain apart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cost reduction on turning Towns into Cities from the Siglo de Oro is nice to have but probably isn’t going to have a massive impact on how your Age goes. The Tercio is also a good unit against militaries that have gone a little too hard on Cavalry but are outpaced by many other strong military units of other civilizations in this Age. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Patrick is a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neighbors-suburban-warfare-is-a-sinister-multiplayer-game-with-a-friendly-face<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package. I had a couple of hands-on sessions with it, navigating its team-based homewrecking action, and though its untraditional format will make for some rough first minutes, it was hard not to walk away from the over the top bedlam with a smile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s maybe no more antithetical setting for Neighbors: Suburban Warfare’s team-versus-team base-building combat romp than the idyllic, prosperity-pilled 1950’s American suburbs. But developer Invisible Walls wanted to make a game that was bright and colorful and would be striking at first glance and approachable to a broad audience. “We also had this idea of the neighborhood feud element from day one,” art director Andreas Bech explained. “And for most of the team, the post-war optimism of the ‘50s and ‘60s resonates with that.” </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Neighbors: Suburban Warfare Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The irony of the collective drive towards the presentation of perfectionism leading to individual households going so mad with power that they would sabotage their peers because they look like they might be doing <em>too</em> well was the bedrock for every iteration of Suburban Warfare. What started off as a game where players would decorate their houses and vandalize their opponents to win top prize at a sort of house pageant turned into a more raucous skirmisher “after it became apparent that [that version of the PvP and PvE] didn't mix,” Invisible Walls CEO David Heldager revealed. “Everyone just wanted to destroy the other’s house.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so their game morphed into the squad-based hybrid shooter and base-builder that I got my hands on for around an hour with the dev team. Our goal was pretty clear: we must infiltrate the enemy abode and destroy its “essential items” like the stove, toilet, and master bed. This is much easier said than done, of course, as there are so many layers of variables and tactics that come into play during each match that chaos is unavoidable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all starts with character selection. Each of the eight available neighbors has their own signature starting items and special abilities, like the Rosie the Riveter-inspired Kim and her throwable pipe wrench that can build a special autonomous oil-spitting turret to defend her home when she’s out pillaging. There were two available neighborhoods (maps) to choose from, each dictating where neutral objectives will be, and each team can choose a specific house layout to use, each floorplan having its own different entrances and essential item locations. This felt like a lot to try to understand up front, but even though there is a county fair's worth of variability in each match, the pursuit of “the perfect competitive combination” is a bit of a fool’s errand. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to be different in that this is the game you play when you’re not playing [something more competitive like] Marvel Rivals,” David said when I asked the team if and how Suburban Warfare could appeal to the types of gamers that prefer a more sweaty PvP experience. “The tone is lighthearted and we designed it for lightheartedness, but we do find people start getting very competitive after like three or four games,” Andreas added. The design consensus among them was to focus on making cool things first, and balancing them second. “We were not experts on PvP and balancing when we started this game,” game director Sebastian Bevensee said, explaining that unfamiliar traps and weapons that will inevitably knock new players out will feel overpowered until they realize that just about everything is that strong on purpose. The goal is to make everything feel impactful so long as you hit with them, and encourage everyone to be a consequential playmaker when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After choosing your avatar to commit minor crimes with and agreeing to what kind of house you’re going to defend with your teammates (and where you’ll be defending it from your opponents), it's time to get to the dirty business of targeted vandalization. Your team of up to four must build all manner of tools, traps, and defenses in order to turn away your annoying nosey neighbors while also empowering your team to be even more annoying and nosier. Buying tools or basic fortifications costs money that you earn slowly over time but in lump sums by knocking out enemies. More valuable options become available when you upgrade your workbench with spare resources found at the construction site, located in a neutral point on every map. After buying starter tools - usually the crowbar since it helps destroy objects faster - every round of Suburban Warfare I played started with a full team sprint towards these wayward crates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My team was pretty good at making it out of the ensuing brawls with a couple of resources without taking too many casualties, but the early moments where no one has special gear is where I felt the character selection and team compositions the most. Big bruisers like Chad can hold the front line and distract the enemy long enough for someone else to snatch resources right out from under you. Or sneaky little bastards like this Dennis the Menace x Kevin McCallister hybrid who can avoid the melee completely and instead start attempting to break into your home while you're gone. Neighbor’s individual special abilities remain impactful throughout the match, but ones with definite strengths above and beyond those never feel stronger than those first few minutes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dennis the Menace x Kevin McCallister hybrid can avoid the melee completely and instead start attempting to break into your home while you're gone.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After taking the resources back we focused on locking down our house, lining the vulnerable parts of our fence with bear traps, repairing damaged doors and windows, and even setting up a small oil rig to turn our passive trickle of money into more of a sprinkler. All the while, both sides were taking turns poking at one another, sneaking to back doors and windows while causing a ruckus on the front lawns by either running up personally and trying to catch a poor homemaker slipping, or ordering more bombastic offensives on the enemy in the form of delivery trucks that speed through the cul de sac and lob boxes full of fireworks at your foes. And then, after around four minutes of game time, night fell on our pitched battle. Besides making the battlefield darker, it also signals that the nocturnal guard dog of each house is up and prowling, and it is devastatingly good at hunting down any enemy that steps onto your property and eliminating them with extreme prejudice, until the sun rises and the chaos ensues again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exchanges between squads, be they in the streets or each other’s living rooms, were always tense because the more dangerous weaponry, like a sledgehammer or a pressurized cannon that shoots oranges, can do players in quickly. And yet the hammer is slow and the cannon, one of the few ranged options in the game, is hard to aim and slow to fire and reload. This was all by design. “We are always encouraging people to be more up front and close,” Sebastian explained, pointing out that their focus on keeping the most effective and easy to use offense as close-ranged options forces players to engage with one another instead of trying to take sniper positions or control the field from afar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t constrain their weapon options from walking more on the wild side, though. Many of the options operate as you assume they would, but then there are some tricky takes on household items, like the aforementioned vacuum that can suck enemies into bashing range. You can build a chicken coup and toss their eggs at foes to blind them. With enough investment into your workbench you can get access to my favorite option so far: a seagull that you can fly to bomb enemies like a Call of Duty kill streak reward. The cartoony madness is lots of fun, moment to moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the course of these cycles across the rounds I played, the biggest issue I found was feeling like I wasn’t doing the right thing at the right time. I wasn’t searching for the most efficient ways to spend money and resources so much as feeling like I was actively contributing to the overall goal of compromising the enemy's home to a permanent end. Picking up the basics is easy, but learning how to know when to go all out on the enemy or when to pull back to defend was something that I couldn’t intuit in my brief time with Neighbors. David agreed. “Our main struggle is, ‘How do you explain the meta in a game like this?’” They’ve seen playtesters grow into sharp and knowledgeable players over half a dozen games or so, so it's not impossible to let go of worry and embrace the madness.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure how it will stand up against genre juggernauts, but it will certainly stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So is Neighbors: Suburban Warfare the next big party shooter? I’m not sure how it will stand up against genre juggernauts, but it will certainly stand out. Two geezers shaped like Mr Magoo and Evel Knievel exchanging plunger crossbow fire in the street only to get hit by a delivery truck tossing bombs into the front yard is a scenario you aren’t going to find in your current favorite team shooter. And Invisible Walls likes it that way. They don’t want to replace your favorite game, they just want to be the Mad Men-coded funhouse you spend your off time in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package. I had a couple of hands-on sessions with it, navigating its team-based homewrecking action, and though its untraditional format will make for some rough first minutes, it was hard not to walk away from the over the top bedlam with a smile.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I’m afraid that I must also recommend my favorite knife in my entire house, a Chinese chef’s knife or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caidao" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caidao</a>. These are often referred to as “Chinese cleavers” in English, although not all Chinese knives are intended for cutting through bones like western cleavers. If you only have one knife for preparing food in your household and not a lot of money, I recommend you pick one up. They’re durable, fairly inexpensive, and versatile enough to cover a huge portion of what you need to do in the kitchen.</p><p>This is probably not news to anyone who grew up in a Chinese household or has studied Chinese cooking. Technically there are multiple kinds of Chinese blades in this form factor that are built for different purposes; some are lighter and meant more for slicing vegetables, while others (such as gudao)<em> </em>are heavier and meant for cutting through bone. I don’t find myself cutting through a lot of bones, but ideally it’s nice to have both around.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pieces of China (Episode 3): Chef Fuchsia Dunlop on the Cleaver, June 11, 2020" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RHFv0NKgBZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Writer Fuchsia Dunlop walks through their experience of learning to use a caidao as a westerner.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I started off with an American-made<a href="https://www.dexterrussellcutlery.com/chinese/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Dexter Russell</a> several years ago, but over time got tipped off to two beloved Chinese brands: CCK or <a href="https://www.chefknivestogo.com/ccksmclstha.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chan Chi Kee</a> out of Hong Kong and Shi Ba Zhi Zuo. CCK is a beloved staple that has unfortunately shot up in price, but can usually be bought for about <a href="https://www.actionsales.com/en/wok-range-general-chinese-cooking-equipment-supplies/hk-kf1812.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$80 to $100</a>,, although if you can get one at a local Chinese grocery store you will probably get a better deal. I’ve had my CCK KF1812 for several years now and love it for most purposes that aren’t blasting through chicken carcasses. Fuchsia Dunlop, a fantastic English-language writer on the subject of Chinese cooking, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fuchsiadunlop/p/B_eVAz6DpXQ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swears by CCK</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CCK Vegetable Cleaver / Slicer - KF1812 - NO.2 Review - Chan Chi Kee - Cai Dao" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pjk6iPdD6Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Chef Panko’s review of the Classic CCK F1812. I have this one!</figcaption></figure></div><p>The CCK is a bit on the pricier end and can be slightly tricky to buy, so for the money and ease of purchase, knives by Shi Ba Zhi Zuo are more affordable and available. A while back, someone on reddit posted a good comparison of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/pamafm/a_short_primer_on_%E8%8F%9C%E5%88%80_chinese_kitchen_knives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two brands and their offerings</a> and it’s a solid guide depending on what you find yourself doing more often. It’s also worth mentioning that Wirecutter is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/why-i-use-a-chinese-cleaver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also a fan of many of the brands listed here</a>. Recently Chef Panko, one of the most thorough knives reviewers I know, was shocked by <a href="https://www.chefpanko.com/hezhen-chinese-vegetable-cleaver-knife-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Henzen YM3L</a>. There are tons of Chinese knives out there, usually with either a wood or metal handle, but most will do the job provided they are built for the task.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hezhen Chinese Vegetable Cleaver Knife Review: X9Cr18Mov   YM3L Series" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dGL3uzBljs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A new budget challenger: the Hezhen YM3L. I haven't tried this one. </figcaption></figure></div><p>What makes a Chinese chef knife such a complete tool is that you can use it for so many tasks in the kitchen: Finely cutting garlic, slicing meat, and cutting thick vegetables. If you know what you’re doing and care for your blade, you basically only need one or two instead of a huge block of knives. The wide, flat blade can be used as a makeshift spatula, making it easy to transfer ingredients. You can also use the flat side to lightly crush garlic, making the skin easy to remove. The dull spine of the blade can be used for tenderizing. I have rarely encountered a tool that was so all-encompassing.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Learn How To Sharpen: Introduction" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zRNT1v0-7s?list=PLsSxXLQSZIe__A5THcrFGto9_PSkXWiN6" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>When I started caring for my knives, I learned the ropes from these now-ancient Korin videos.

Chef Panko has a fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Ad-hRl3G8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide to whetstones and their maintenance here</a>. When it comes to sharpening knives, the now more than decade old introductory tutorials by <a href="https://www.korin.com/vincent-knife-sharpener" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent Kazuhito Lau</a> over at <a href="https://www.korin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korin</a> remain the best basic introduction to the topic, although the angle of caidao can differ from the angle of Japanese knives.

In the video,&nbsp; Chung Sun Lau shows off his knives, and he’s quick to point out that both are either as old as his son if not older. With proper care, a Chinese knife will last decades and quickly become one of the most useful tools in your house. The caidao is not just a staple of Chinese cooking, it is a knife for everybody: versatile, inexpensive and able to withstand tremendous abuse. “How do you know if you can’t use a knife anymore?” Randy Lau asks. “If the handle is broken,” his dad responds.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="🔪 Chinese Knife Skills 101: How a chef cares for his knives" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16Wd5jiu5wA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Made With Lau rocks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/11-bit-studios-reveals-revised-roadmap-for-frostpunk-2-console-ports-arriving-in-summer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>11 bit studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has revealed</a> its new revised roadmap for Frostpunk 2, a game that was released in September last year. Since it was released, it has been a huge success, with the developers saying that it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">profitable three days</a> after its release, with sales topping 350,000 by that point. Since then, the team has been hard at work on updating the game, adding improvements and fixes to the game, while working on some of the upcoming major updates that would be added.</p>
<p>11 bit studios did initially release a roadmap in November, where it was announced that there would be a free update, as well as console ports in the future. Since then, the studio has released a revised roadmap, which can be seen on Steam. In the roadmap, those interested can get a more accurate timeline as to when the updates and ports will be added to the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>First and foremost, the free major content update will be released on May 8. The text that announces it reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>A day to be remembered: a&nbsp;<strong>Free Major Content Update</strong> that will adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first new Londoners.</em></p>
<p>After the first major update is released for Frostpunk 2, those on consoles can expect to get their hands on the game after waiting just under a year for it. It doesn't have a set release date for console, but the developers have stated that Frostpunk 2 is set to release on console in the Summer. It's set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there is no mention of the game being ported to last-gen consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Whether it will be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 when that console releases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Aside from the free content update and the port of the game to consoles, Frostpunk 2 has a major lineup for 2025 at the very least. The Spectrum DLC is set to release in the Fall, and the developers have left the cryptic message with it that it will "help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one."</p>
<p>After the Spectrum DLC, the Aurora DLC is also slated to release this year, but depending on how the development and porting goes of the first three major highlights of the roadmap, it may end up pushed into 2026.</p>
<p>Looking into next year, there is a third DLC planned for Frostpunk 2, adding even more content to the game. It's not said yet what is planned for either the Aurora DLC or the third DLC, but more information is bound to be released by 11 bit studios in the future.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-a-minecraft-server">Patrick Recommends: A <em>Minecraft</em> Server</h2><figure><figcaption><span>That movie really is going to be terrible, isn't it?</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, I said <em>Minecraft</em>, a game released all the way back in 2011, was my second favorite game that year. The reason was my oldest daughter taking an interest in <em>Minecraft</em>, which led to me taking an interest in <em>Minecraft</em>. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-best-video-games-this-year-helped-me-feel-closer-to-people/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Here's what I wrote:</a></p><p><em>"As kids get older, it becomes harder and harder to connect on the same level as them. My oldest is only six years old, and I can already sense that tension at work. [...] With&nbsp;Minecraft, my daughter and I can play in the same world together, and the power balance shifts completely. She is the one in control, the one with more knowledge than me. She’s the one guiding me from one area to the next, telling me what to do and what to build. She’s the one asking me to find this or that resource, to help build a house she’s working on. When I’m asking her to do homework, I’m a parent. When we’re in&nbsp;Minecraft, we’re peers."</em></p><p>The difference between 2022 and 2025 is that my six-year-old is now eight years old. At the time, my youngest was two years old. Today, she's on the verge of turning five years old. (Life goes <em>fast</em>, man.) <em>Minecraft</em>, to its credit, remains borderline indecipherable. You could tell me the UI is exactly the same way it was in 2011 and I'd believe you, with the major change being lots of new monetization. </p><p>(I know that's not the case, and by all accounts Microsoft's been a good steward. But it's wild how strange and arcane <em>Minecraft</em> remains.)</p><p>But another difference between then and now is that <em>Minecraft</em> has now clicked for my youngest. She can fly around the world. She can build things. She has <em>big ideas</em>. It's lead to family <em>Minecraft</em> nights, as we all sit around on the same world, and also prompted my neighbor to set up a private server, where the kids dip and out during the week, then convene on the weekend to talk about what they built. It's super cool. It's like a playground that exists in and out of time and space.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-harmonies">Cado Recommends: <em>Harmonies</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Harmonies</em> is a board game where you take random sets of wooden tokens and arrange miniature landscapes on a hex grid with the goal of creating specific habitats for animals to live in. It’s quick to learn, has gorgeous components, and yet the random elements make for a devilishly delicious puzzle each time. Every turn you choose a set of three random tiles from a central pool. You can arrange these tiles however you’d like onto your board, with some tiles (like rocks) allowing you to stack them for better points at the end of the game. One rock makes a small hill but three rocks stacked on top of each other makes a large mountain, and that mountain is worth six more points than the hill!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also take an Animal card during your turn. Animal cards have specific arrangements of tiles on them that, when created, will score you extra points at the end of the game. You score these points by placing a small animal cube on the corresponding tile when you’ve completed the arrangement on the animal card to represent that these animals have moved into that habitat.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the wonderful puzzle of <em>Harmonies </em>is then trying your best to maximize how many animals you can house at once. Once a cube is placed on a tile you can’t place further cubes or stack any more tiles on that space. Those two stacked rocks that make a medium hill are now stuck as a medium hill, but the monkey that moved into that space will hopefully make up the difference in points by the end of the game. At least you hope.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>These monkeys and fish are bad neighbors</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main tension in the game comes from the fact that Animal cards all require you to place the same animal cube <em>multiple</em> times for the most points. The first monkey that moves into my hill by the river only gets me five points, but if I do that twice I’m gaining 11 instead. But now, that hill won’t be able to grow into a mountain, and my fish wants to live in a river next to a mountain, not some dinky medium hill!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beautiful Natural Harmony</span></figcaption></figure><p>The beautiful moments come when you find two animals that love to be neighbors. These sting rays want to live in a river next to two small hills...but they only lock the river in. You can build their habitat and <em>then </em>continue to stack rocks to attract those monkeys later! It’s in finding these small harmonies (<em>haha</em>) between different animals where the game really sings, that “hell yes” moment of realizing a perfect turn of tiles and animal cards that scratch my brain’s puzzle solving centers just so. The wooden habitat tiles add that extra tactile “oomph” that a good board game needs, and the whimsical illustrations on the animal cards make each draw of the animal pile a new visual delight.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It's really a perfect storm for a game this simple, and one of the reasons I picked it up after playing it just twice at a local board game meetup. The fact that it also allows for a solo game that is just as engaging as the multiplayer mode means that I can easily play a game in 15 minutes on my own and feel satisfied with my time. </p><p>Who wouldn't want to make a home for these adorable animals to live in? Have you <em>seen</em> those ducks? Delightful.</p>

The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>. While the average trainer is probably most excited to return to Kalos in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <em>Champions </em>could fundamentally change how competitive <em>Pokémon </em>operates, and by extension open up a design space for RPGs like <em>Z-A</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195618" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s start with what we know. <em>Pokémon Champions </em>is a battle simulation game that won’t be tied to a specific RPG. Right now, competitive players battle in whatever the current mainline <em>Pokémon </em>is, so the best trainers in the scene are battling in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> in official tournaments. This naturally limits the Pokémon players can use, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">gimmick mechanics</a></span> they can utilize. <em>Champions</em>, meanwhile, will not be tied to a specific game and can import different Pokémon from the <em>Pokémon Home</em> storage app (though The Pokémon Company makes clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in its press release</a></span> that there will be some restrictions). The trailer also shows that <em>Champions</em> supports different gameplay mechanics like Mega Evolution and Terastallization, indicating that it might be possible to use different strategies that aren’t beholden to a game-specific rule set.</p><p>Just how freely we’ll be able to customize rules and party compositions remains to be seen, but The Pokémon Company creating an officially licensed battle simulator similar to the third-party ones used by competitive pros that aren’t limited to the current generation is a huge deal. This means professional players and the average fan will no longer be tied to one another. Official <em>Pokémon </em>tournaments won’t be limited to specific RPGs’ rosters, and mainline games could get more experimental without being chained to a competitive scene.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is one of the most innovative games the series has released in the past decade. It has new battle mechanics like the agile and strong style moves that let you choose to prioritize speed or power, which would be considered “broken” in competitive play. But <em>Legends: Arceus </em>doesn’t have multiplayer battles and doesn’t have to design its turn-based gameplay around whether or not something is fair to a rival trainer. As a result, some of the game’s big story battles are among the most challenging and interesting the series has ever put out. As a non-competitive player, some of the most strategic plays I’ve ever had to make in a <em>Pokémon </em>game’s main story involved making decisions about whether or not to use agile attacks to try and get in a few extra hits, or put everything I had into a strong one in hopes of knocking an enemy out in one shot. </p><p>This was a simple tweak to long-established <em>Pokémon </em>mechanics, but if Game Freak can develop RPGs without having to account for a completely different way they might be played in tournaments, it could mean cool innovations like this in future games. <em>Legends: Z-A</em> even introduces its own spin on <em>Pokémon</em> battles by incorporating positioning and area-of-effect to make use of the walkable 3D combat zones. Cool changes like this are only possible if we stop worrying about competitive viability and make space for innovative RPG design.</p><p>Severing competitive tournaments from the RPGs is a good thing for everyone, and some of the biggest names in professional <em>Pokémon </em>battling have expressed that having their own space to play and experiment could be a game changer for the scene.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions for both competitive and casual players, but the potential possibilities <em>Pokémon Champions</em> could bring to all sides of the community make it the most exciting part of the Presents showcase. I’m stoked for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but in the long run, I’m even more interested in how the <em>Pokémon </em>series could keep changing for the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-innovating-on-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98we%E2%80%99re-innovating-on-gameplay-not-monetisation-%E2%80%99-splitgate-2-ceo-says.1120818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-innovating-on-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I was fortunate enough to get hands-on with Splitgate 2 a month before the game entered the current open alpha. I also had the chance to sit down with Ian Proulx, the co-founder and CEO of 1047 Studios, the developer behind this high-octane shooter. As I explored the intense mechanics of Splitgate 2, I found myself gelling <strong>very nicely </strong>with what was on offer.</p>



<p>As questions were put to Proulx, I learned about the future of Splitgate 2, which is a direct follow-on from the shooter that was released in 2019 on PC, and then later on console. In this sequel, evolution is the order of the day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-to-do">More To Do</h2>



<p>Ian Proulx was very transparent about the areas in which Splitgate (the first game) fell short. The title had awesome short-term retention, but players dropped off alarmingly fast after realising that there wasn’t much ‘to do’ or chase in the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was super fun, super simple, but it lacked variety and that staying power. </p>



<p>We had really strong short-term retention, our day one and day seven was world class – better than many of the top shooters you’ll see today. </p>



<p>But what we saw is players would come on, play for 3 or 4 weeks, and then say, ‘now what?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at 1047 Games has addressed those concerns in the follow-up title.</p>



<p>There will be more things to unlock, and as Proulx said, ‘We can keep you on the hook for longer by giving you more content over time.’ This will include seasonal events, ‘lots of live-ops stuff’, and customisation elements. </p>



<p>The game has been bolstered immeasurably by new movement mechanics, like sliding, and a massive 24-player multi-team mode inspired by Halo’s Big Team Battle mode. It’s also being released on PS4 and Xbox One to serve the last generation of players quite nicely, which is a solid touch from the team.</p>



<p>In the last few years, Splitgate 2’s potential has allowed 1047 Games to expand from a team of 10 to almost 200 employees, all of which are stoked about the impending launch of this fantastic shooter.</p>



<p>I asked Ian Proulx about the proposed operating model for the game, given that so many free-to-play shooters have launched in recent years – and not all of them have succeeded.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Splitgate 2 will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>We’re innovating on gameplay, we’re not innovating on monetisation.</p>



<p>(It’ll feature) traditional industry elements and no pay-to-win or gacha mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had the opportunity to play the Splitgate 2 alpha ahead of the release, thanks to 1047 Games. Before the session took place, I sat down with the studio’s CEO to talk about the development – and more importantly, the future – of this innovative first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Given my passion for the industry, I was eager to learn whether esports plans sat in the pipeline for Splitgate 2. My discussion with Ian Proulx, also one of the studio’s founders, revealed exciting things about the competitive future of Splitgate 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-future-is-competitive">The Future is Competitive</h2>



<p>Splitgate 2 is a phenomenal shooter with stacks of potential. When I got hands-on with the title a month before it entered the current alpha playtest, I was instantly hooked. The fast-paced gameplay twinned with genuinely enjoyable weapon mechanics had me by the throat – in a good way. I was <strong>enthused </strong>by what I experienced.</p>



<p>In a brief conversation with Ian Proulx, I dove into the competitive landscape for Splitgate 2, learning about the potential for this game to slot nicely into the esports landscape.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would say it’s not a priority for launch, but I definitely see this game being an esport one day.</p>



<p>We like games that are fair, and that falls under the ‘fun category’ for me. We also like the fact that the game has a lot of skill expression, which nautrally lends itself to esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Splitgate 2 uses genius ‘portal mechanics’ that allow players to warp around the battlefield like never before. It adds a unique element to the pacing, which is otherwise built around a typical run-and-gun operating model.</p>



<p>Proulx continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, the top priority is, ‘Let’s just go and make a fun shooter.’</p>



<p>If we do that and it turns into an esport, that’s great – but if it’s just a casual thing, that’s great too.</p>



<p>That said, I would love for this to be an esport one day. It’s a post-launch thing and not something I want to force or prioritise, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s typically quite tough for new games to elbow their way into the esports market. It has been dominated for so long by The Big Three: Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Other titles have cut their way into the wider business, but it’s tough.</p>



<p>In recent years, the most successful <strong>new </strong>game was VALORANT, but that’s backed by Riot Games, so the foothold was already there. For a new IP to break into the market successfully, a perfect storm of positive circumstances must unfold.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">Mega Evolutions will be making a return</a>, so it's possible that the starters could receive those. There's been a precendent set with Mega Evolutions where some get new typing, such as Mega Ampharos being Electric/Dragon instead of pure Electric type and Pinsir becoming a Bug/Flying type when it Mega Evolves instead of staying pure Bug.</p><p>Let's take a look at what we know about the three starters and what potential changes Legends Z-A could bring to them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="4000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290"></a><figcaption>The three starters in Pokemon Legends Z-A (from left to right): Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg"></figure><h2>Chikorita</h2><p>Chikorita is the Grass type starter from Generation 2, and is unfortunately the worst starter of its trio, as well as considered to be one of the worst starters historically. That's mostly due to the shallow pool of moves its final form, Meganium, can learn and its mediocre stats. However, a Mega Evolution or alternate form could drastically improve Meganium.</p><p>Nintendo could lean into Meganium's reptilian design and give it a secondary Dragon typing. Meganium already learns some Dragon type attacks, including Dragon Tail and Outrage, but a secondary Dragon type would also power them up by 50% due to STAB, or Same Type Attack Bonus. This would make Meganium more offensively viable.</p><p>Meganium is more defensively oriented, and a Dragon typing would be a bit of a mixed bag. It would bolster its already impressive resistances to Water, Grass, and Electric moves. However, it would add Dragon and Fairy weaknesses.</p><p>An alternate form with the Grass/Fairy typing would give Meganium the best of both worlds, defensively and offensively. Fairy is regarded as one of the best types in Pokemon so far.</p><p>A secondary Fairy type would gives Meganium an immunity to Dragon type attacks and new resistances to Dark and Fighting type attacks, while only adding one additional weakness to Steel type attacks. However, it would now take quadruple damage from Poison-type attacks instead of double. A secondary Fairy typing also cancels out Meganium's weaknesses to bug types too, making them only do neutral damage.</p><p>Offensively, Fairy is a powerful type, hitting Dark, Dragon, and Fighting types for extra damage. However, Meganium will still struggle against Fire and Poison types, as they resist Fairy type attacks.</p><h2>Tepig</h2><p>Tepig is the Fire starter from Generation 5 and its final evolution is Emboar, a Fire/Fighting type. With high offensive stats on both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, along with a versatile attacking movepool, Emboar doesn't need as much as a drastic change like Meganium. However, if Nintendo wants to switch up Emboar's typing in a Mega Evolution or alternate form, one possibility is Fire/Ground. Thematically, that would fit Emboar as a pig, rolling around in the mud.</p><p>A secondary Ground typing might actually make Emboar worse, as it would take quadruple damage from Water type attacks and lose its Grass resistance. However, it would gain an Electric immunity. Either way, Emboar is fine as it is, and it's possible that it could retain its Fire/Fighting typing if given an alternate form.</p><h2>Totodile</h2><p>Totodile is Generation 2's Water type starter. Of the Johto trio, it's the most physically offensive, making it a popular option. Its final evolution is Feraligatr, which, like Emboar, also doesn't need a massive overhaul. Feraligatr is a pure Water type, so it's possible that it could gain a secondary typing.</p><p>The secondary typing that makes the most sense thematically for Feraligatr would be Dark, as that plays into Totodile's mischievous and playful nature. Plus, Feraligatr already learns plenty of Dark type moves such as Bite, Crunch, Fake Tears, Snarl, and Lash Out. A secondary Dark typing would also give its Dark attacking moves the STAB bonus.</p><p>Feraligatr is reptilian, just like Meganium, so a Water/Dragon typing fits too. Feraligatr already learns moves like Dragon Claw, Outrage, and Dragon Dance. As long as a Mega Evolution or alternate form of Meganium isn't Grass/Dragon, Feraligatr can go down the route as a Dragon type, as I don't imagine Nintendo would want to double up on the Dragon typing for two starters.</p><p>Pokemon Legends Z-A is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">launch in late 2025 for Nintendo Switch</a>. It'll have a new take on the traditional Pokemon battle system, including real-time elements with attack moves that have a certain amount of reach. Moving Pokemon out of the way will cause attacks to miss.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/terminator-2d-no-fate-is-a-gritty-sidescroller-coming-in-september.1120770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-2d-no-fate-sidescroller-september<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau have announced&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>, a gritty sidescroller in which you must put a stop to the T-1000 and foil Skynet's plans before the human race is destroyed.</p>

<p>The game will allow you to play as either Sarah Connor or Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 as you fight to stop the shapeshifting android, memorably played by Robert Patrick in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em> (and in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>).</p>

<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>'s story will blend "iconic scenes" from the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>with "original scenarios and multiple endings", which sounds like a rather unique mixture.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=QITciBWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=nA9hX4xL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several iconic&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes are recreated in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we can see&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes like Sarah Connor working out in her hospital room, Arnie's T-800 duking it out with thugs in a dingy bar, and, of course, that iconic truck chase sequence.</p>

<p>We also see how the gameplay will work, and it looks like&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>will take on a sort of&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style run-and-gun feel; we can see Connor snap-aiming in various directions,&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style, as well as lots of fast-paced action rendered in crisp pixel art.</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>has a pretty pleasing SNES and Genesis-era feel to it, right down to the continue screen, which feels like exactly the kind of thing a licensed&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>game would have sported back in the 90s.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>here. It's even got a fun reworked version of the classic&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>theme for you to enjoy. Good luck getting that one out of your head once it's in there.</p>




<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>isn't the only video game based on the&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>series that's set to launch in the (hopefully near!) future.</p>

<p>There's also Nacon's&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, which, as its name suggests, is a survival game in which you must make sense of humanity's near-extinction at the hands of Skynet, scavenging for resources and navigating an irrevocably changed world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't know when that one's coming out; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in 2025</a> back in August, although it's more than possible we'll hear something about it during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">next week's Nacon Connect presentation</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on September 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>As per Tribes/Tiny Wings convention, Haste is a game of momentum, where you’ll need to build up speed on downwards slopes before launching yourself off the rises. Spend too long off the ground, though, and all that meddlesome air friction will slow you right down, thus encouraging a satisfyingly rapid-yet-graceful series of up-down manoeuvres. Like a dolphin, who’s really good at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>.</p>
<p>While you don’t do much <em>except</em> run forwards in Haste, it is keen to put up more of a challenge than just finding the perfect racing line. Randomised obstacles range from simple trees and spiked vines to giant lasers, rising lava pools that obscure all but a precious few slopes, and eventually, the rocket barrages of a hefty robot you defeat by faceplanting into at 120kph. </p>
<p>Dodging all these while keeping your pace up does engage a sufficiently diverse selection of brain parts to feel worthwhile and satisfying, and fatigue is rarely an issue as each level takes less than a minute to clear. In between, you can select your next dash from a branching map, with occasional stops to refill your health or buy sprint-assisting gadgets using collected crystals.</p>

<p>Hang on a tic. Branching paths? Run-specific upgrades? Why, this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> in unusually aerodynamic parachute pants, which I guess also means we’re Wishlisting a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> for about the fiftieth time this week. Sorry for that as well. Except, again, Haste doesn’t really care about making you repeat yourself into finally achieving one ultimate, golden run. Upgrades are nice and all, but deep down it’s still a test of speed, not builds – and with some effective application of the 'glide downwards' key, there’s an awful lot of speed to be had.</p>
<p>At its best, Haste is thrillingly kinetic, repeatedly spiking you with the rush of near-missing deathtraps at Mach 1. Even the soundtrack eggs you on, its pounding electronica slowing down as you do; biff a landing or misjudge an obstacle and it starts to sound almost panicked in its haggardness, as if the music itself is begging you to spin back up the giant hamster wheel that powers its continued existence.</p>
<p>Not everything is conducive to that delicious sense of forward velocity. One of the special stages merely has you painting the colour back into a monochrome island by running around it in circles, an incongruous non-challenge given the exceedingly generous time limit. As a longtime connoisseur of go-fast hill sliding games, however, I can say that for the most part, Haste: Broken Worlds is exactly my speed. You can see if it’s yours as well with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796470/HASTE_Broken_Worlds/">Steam demo</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite a small but steady stream of new releases for the headset, as well as adapters to make the headset work with PCs, its fortunes don’t seem to have meaningfully improved. Last summer, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/psvr2-ps5-sale-discount-cheap-deal-1851608173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/psvr2-ps5-sale-discount-cheap-deal-1851608173">the device was briefly on sale for $200 off</a></span>. </p><p>The bigger question is why Sony waited this long to aggressively cut the price in the first place. Maybe it’s only recently that the manufacturing costs came down enough to make that viable. After all, why would Sony want to lose money on headsets for an ecosystem that’s barely growing? At the same time, games sell consoles, and without the clear backing of Sony the PS VR2 library never took off. How can others place big bets on the hardware if the company that made it doesn’t seem willing to do the same? </p><p> That doesn’t mean here are no games for PS VR2. Sony notes in today’s blog post that <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em>, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, and<em> Metro Awakening VR</em> all recently arrived on the platform, with <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>, and others still on the way. For now though, there still doesn’t seem to be a killer app coming down the road anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was the start of nine months of nonstop reveals of the 120 new creatures being added to the Pokédex, alongside excitement about the Nintendo Switch’s second mainline entry, following 2019's <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield. </em>And while it <em>was</em> a surprise announcement in the sense that Nintendo had kept it under wraps until that point, it was also expected that a new game would be announced, because there’s a new game every three years, right?</p><p>That’s actually only been true since 2010, following the launch of <em>Black </em>and <em>White. </em>By 2013 we had <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>(as well as the bonus of the first and only sequels, <em>Black 2</em> and <em>White 2 </em>in 2012). Then, like clockwork, 2016 gave us <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>, before 2019's <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>, and 2022's <em>S&amp;V.</em> That’s five mainline entries in a row, each three years apart, rather giving the impression that this was to be the norm. And it almost is; aside from  2006's <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>and 2010's <em>Black </em>and <em>White</em>, each coming out four years after the previous, it’s always been three years.</p><p>Seemingly, 2025 is to be another of those exceptions. What’s so odd is the complete quiet about it all. No one seems to have noticed?</p><h2 id="h494332"><a id=""></a>The Three-Year Itch</h2><p>As an observer, it really rather looked like Game Freak had little choice but to get a mainline game out every third year—to the point where the clearly unpolished <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> would surely have been given more time under any other circumstances. But there’s a <em>vast</em> industry built around those games, and missing its release date would have knocked over a row of dominos that could have cost Nintendo, Game Freak, Creatures and The Pokémon Company (a confusing collection of companies who all overlap in the middle) billions.</p><p>Think about the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>. Every three years for the last 15, a new era of cards is launched, themed around the name and region of the most recent game, and highlighting the Pokémon introduced in the new generation. Those cards have to be in production long before the game’s even released, given—for instance—Japan’s first set of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> era TCG cards were released in January 2023, just two months after the game came out. The artwork alone would have been commissioned months ahead, and the intricacies of the game design based on all the new monsters worked out well in advance, too. If the game slipped, the cards would either have to be enormously expensively delayed, or come out ahead of the game and ruin twists and surprises,  and in turn knock down the next domino: merchandise. </p><p>So to shift to a four-year development cycle (and let’s be clear, they absolutely should, or even a longer one, because Game Freak employees deserve the time and space to avoid crunch and make the best game possible) has enormous implications. Ones that must be planned for, presumably years in advance. Nintendo, Game Freak, et al, are all so notoriously tight-lipped about <em>everything</em>, and it’s wildly unlikely they’d ever tell anyone such intentions, so we’re left to just guess. And my guess would be that the reaction to <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>’s dubious (and ongoing) technical state caused decisions to be made within to do two different things:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Take longer to make an open-world game that isn’t cracking at the seams</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Make it for the Switch 2 only</p><p>That latter one would have been very difficult to get away with in 2025. Sure, it’d have been an <em>amazing</em> way to sell Switch 2s over the 2025 holiday season, but the console would still be six months old at most, and most people would expect a game announced today to work on the console they own today. But next year? It’s an easier sell. In fact, it’s pretty much bog-standard for a new <em>Pokémon </em>game to release a year or two after the latest Nintendo hardware.</p><h2 id="h494333"><a id=""></a>Domino Rally</h2><p>The implications are still interesting, however. The <em>PTCG </em>is going to need to run <em>SV</em> for an extra year, and it’s already looking a bit worn out. The ex era is being revamped later this year with the addition of mega evolution cards, but while that’ll change up the meta a bit and obviously give them a chance to take advantage of the current ludicrous boom in sales to sell a gazillion Mega Charizard-themed boxes, it still leaves 2026 and the first half of 2027 to fill with Generation IX. That explains 2025's year-long release of Prismatic Evolution special sets, a year earlier than you’d have expected given how the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era ended with a full year of Crown Zenith sets—it’s clearly a mid-point thing, rather than an ending. We can expect some sort of ex-celebrating bonanza next year, maybe?</p><p>Anyway, there you go. Just in case you too were thinking how weird it is that no one’s talking about this.</p><p>Unless of course they go and surprise-announce it in the April Nintendo Direct, and make me look like a complete fool.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket and a Ranked Mode would go hand in hand. Players can already battle the computer—and each other—and there are a ton of cards to choose from. A ton of features have already made their way into Pokémon TCG Pocket, and Ranked Mode needs to be one of them.</p>



<p>It’s amazing to see how Pokémon TCG Pocket has gone from strength to strength since launch. New sets have continually been added from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>. But the community is always asking for new content and modes to be welcomed. It was a big day when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a> was finally integrated into Pocket.</p>



<p>Another core gameplay mechanic Pokémon TCG Pocket is missing is Ranked Battles. Are the player’s cries being heard? Or will the wait go on?</p>

<p><strong>Ranked Mode finally debuts in Pokémon TCG Pocket at the end of March 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited news came during the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokemon Presents</a> affair. The special presentation celebrated all things Pokémon and included breaking news and ended with a groundbreaking gameplay trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Amidst the reveals and content drops, we were informed of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>—a new Pokémon TCG Pocket booster set.</p>



<p>This was cool, but what was even cooler was the set’s trailer also mentioned Ranked Matches at the very end of it. Even though a specific date wasn’t given, we know for sure it’s coming at the end of March 2025. A delay could happen between now and then, so be prepared for the worst, if not, you can use your best decks to conquer opponents in Ranked Mode.</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Official Pokémon YouTube channel</a>‘s full Triumphant Light trailer below—featuring the Ranked Battles mention for the finale.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked-mode-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is Ranked Mode in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we believe Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Mode is a conventional ranked system whereby players are matched up into divisions or leagues appropriate to their skill level, and wins and losses determine if you rise or fall through the ranks.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s say there are 10 ranked divisions for Ranked Mode. if you’re in Rank 5, winning matches in a row may end up with you <strong>being promoted</strong> to Rank 4, then 3, and so forth. Consecutive losses could very well see you <strong>drop down the rankings</strong>.</p>



<p>Many Pokémon TCG Pocket decks revolve around coin flips, the cards you draw, and a lot of luck overall. So it will be interesting to see if any rules and regulations are established for Ranked Mode.</p>



<hr>



<p>Could the addition of Ranked Mode be a game-changing feature for Pokémon TCG Pocket? Have you already got a deck in mind to frustrate and defeat opponents?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-rebrand-reburn-la-quimera/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>4A Games Ukraine, one of the studios behind the Metro franchise, has revealed a rebrand and an all-new IP. It’s called ‘La Quimera’, which is Spanish for ‘The Chimera’. The game and the studio’s foundation were leaked recently, but today, a full and official announcement has taken place, with the game’s first trailer debuting online.</p>



<p>La Quimera is a futuristic sci-fi shooter set in Latin America, and it boasts a narrative-driven campaign that can be played either solo or with friends. The game has been written by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon), and it features a combination of Latin American folklore and ‘advanced weaponry and technology.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-reburn">Introducing Reburn</h2>



<p>Reburn is a rebranding of 4A Games Ukraine, and it’s an independent studio with around 110 employees. Many of these developers have worked on the Metro franchise, and some have experience going back to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. The studio is being led by Dmytro Lymar, a twenty-year industry veteran.</p>



<p>It’s a little confusing, admittedly. The long and short of it is that in 2014, a split took place at 4A Games that left part of the company in the Ukraine while another branch opened up in Malta, but they both shared technology and teams and collaborated on games like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>In 2020, Embracer acquired the 4A team in Malta, while the 4A Ukraine studio started working on La Quimera after landing fresh funding and becoming much more independent. While 4A Games (Malta) continues to work on Metro, Reburn is an entirely separate entity working on this all-new IP.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lymar said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series</em>. <em>We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>La Quimera is set in a Latin American megalopolis and ‘lush jungle’. Players will be able to adorn themselves in an advanced suit of armour as they battle rival factions across what looks like a gorgeous world. In a press release, it was stressed that the game has ‘tense gunplay and intimate storytelling’.</p>



<p>Here’s the announcement trailer for La Quimera:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks good, and it’s a wonder it has been kept under wraps for so long. The team at Reburn has been working on La Quimera for almost five years, and if the announcement trailer is anything to go by, it should be a banger of a title.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the enemies that seem to resemble the Helghast from the Killzone franchise.</p>



<p>The game can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">wishlisted on Steam</a>, but no release window has been confirmed for the game.</p>

            <p>Mario + Rabbids creator Davide Soliani believes players are looking for unique independent games that are "willing to tell different stories".</p>
<p>Soliani left Ubisoft last year after 25 years at Ubisoft and has now joined with writer Christian Cantamessa (Red Dead Redemption, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-war">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a>, the forthcoming Perfect Dark reboot) to form a new studio, Day 4 Night.</p>
<p>Along with other former Ubisoft Milan employees, the pair are working on a new "passion project", though admitted it's a risky time in the games industry to be founding a new studio. </p>

<p>"I think stupidity made us," Cantamessa told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/davide-soliani-interview/">VGC</a>, discussing the risk of a new studio. "This industry is really at a crossroads right now. We've reached the point where you have massive overheads, you need to recoup those massive investments, and it becomes really hard to sustain."</p>
<p>He explained the studio's financing, from publisher Krafton and Ed Fries' 1Up Ventures, is purely based on stock, meaning the pair have complete creative freedom.</p>
<p>"On one end, you have a situation where everyone is a bit more careful at investing money," said Soliani. "At the same time, there is a growing interest from the player towards games that are a bit, let's say, out of the chorus. They are a bit different. They are willing to tell different stories…that's what we are observing as developers and as players."</p>
<p>Cantamessa compared the current state of the industry with the collapse of Hollywood and the rise of independent filmmaking. "What you see now is the audience is aligning away from the more studio fare and towards the indie fare," he said. "So I think maybe we're in the late 60s, 70s of cinema, and we're starting to see the Bonnie and Clyde of the video game world."</p>
<p>As for the new project itself, Soliani said it's a new IP and while gameplay comes first, it's "merging with storytelling in a meaningful way".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">Soliani also discussed leaving Ubisoft</a> and assured the decision was not due to poor sales of the Mario + Rabbids Kindgom Battle sequel, Sparks of Hope.</p>
<p>"The reason I left is not because I was trying to get away from Ubisoft for any specific reason, but because I was searching for something that I couldn't find there... something that we're now creating together here [at Day 4 Night]," he said.</p>
<p>"For me, Kingdom Battle was a personal project, like the one that we are doing now at Day 4 Night," he said. "It was really a love letter to Nintendo. It's not a surprise that I'm a Nintendo lover. In my office, I currently have a huge Mario plushie that my friend sent me from Tokyo."</p>
<p>Further, Kingdom Battle was a "surprise" success, but that meant the sequel was "harder to develop". "There was too much overthinking about it all around me," he said. "So to me it was a bit…it was still a joy, it was a wonderful experience because I always loved working with Nintendo and I always will."</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">Ubisoft's comments on the game's reception</a> were "a bit hurtful for the morale of the team" Soliana admitted. "Because we just finished working for three and a half years and were super committed to creating a very good game. So, of course, it was not the kind of message that we wanted to receive back in those days.</p>
<p>"It was a bit hurtful, but nothing crazy. I think that's normal…every development team is proud of what they are doing and always searching for encouraging words, which in that situation, was maybe needed. It was a bit harsh on the team, but nothing that we didn't solve by talking internally back when we were in the company."</p>
<p>The announcement of the first Mario + Rabbids game launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Soliani to notoriety as Ubisoft Crying Man</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft itself is going through a tumultuous time at the moment. While it has the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the horizon, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">closed its UK studio last month</a> and laid off 185 jobs across the business.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">company also looks poised to be sold or taken private</a>, after it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Chinese conglomerate Tencent was considering a buyout</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Pokémon Day stream gave us a first gameplay trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, including some huge changes for Pokémon battles and returning fan-favourite features. They’ve also re-confirmed that the game will launch this year for Nintendo Switch with a Late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The “extended” look at the game amounted to a three and a half minute narrated walkthrough of the game’s setting and key features.</p>
<p>it’s set in Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y with Prism Tower at its heart while the urban landscape undergoes a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. Once you reach the city at the start of the game, you’ll be able to choose from Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile as the three starters – pour one out for Cyndaquil fans, as Tepig replaces him in the Gen 2 line-up.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s a new frenemy to be your rival, either Urbain or Taunie, depending on the appearance you choose for yourself in the game. The hotel you stay at is run by AZ and his partner Pokémon Floette, returning from Pokémon X&amp;Y. At the head of the redevelopment plan is Quasartico Inc. and their CEO Jett and her subordinate Vinnie.</p>

<p>Throughout the city are wild zones for Pokémon to thrive, locked off by numbered green gates. Here you’ll use the same style of catching mechanics as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>, just throwing Poké Balls at creatures, and using your Pokémon’s abilities to weaken tougher targets.</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y with Pokémon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>There’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time. Maybe in April?</p>
