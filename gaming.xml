			<p>Despite having been only a one-off, few games have managed to leave a lasting impact on video games as much as Shadow of the Colossus did. Its unique atmosphere and storytelling and the tense battles against the gigantic colossi have etched themselves in the hearts of any who had the pleasure of experiencing them, turning the game into something truly special that has yet to be replicated, and understandably so, as the game by Fumito Ueda is really one of a kind.</p>
<p>The challenges coming with trying to attempt something unprecedented, however, did not stop Canada-based development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Brick Games</a>. On the contrary, actually. While their debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eternal Strands</a>, is clearly inspired by that classic, this action-adventure title is also something more. It attempts to combine the intense fights against giant creatures seen in the PlayStation exclusive with exploration mechanics reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a progression system inspired by the Monster Hunter series, a more involving narrative, and a truly impressive physics system that allows players to use the magical tools at main character Brynn's disposal in different ways to solve navigational puzzles and defeat both small and big enemies. Overall, this creates what can be considered in some ways to be as unique an experience as that of Shadow of the Colossus, albeit without the magical atmosphere of Fumito Ueda's legendary game.</p>

<p>One thing that Eternal Strands does not try to be is a narrative-driven experience, despite having been developed by Mike Laidlaw, the man behind one of the most celebrated narrative-driven RPG series ever made: the Dragon Age series. Still, the game does feature a tight narrative, with plenty of additional story content for those who want to experience more of the mystical realm of the Enclave, a magical city that ended up getting separated from the rest of the world by some sort of barrier known as the Rift. The young Weaver Brynn, together with other companions, manages to break through this Rift, enter the Enclave, explore its ruins, and eventually understand why and how the city was separated from the rest of the world and the dangers it hides.</p>
<p>While the world and the lore of Eternal Strands are definitely well-developed, with a lot of different political entities involved in the grand scheme of things, the story shouldn't be the main reason to play the game. It is most certainly not bad, but it's not particularly interesting either, as its pacing is extremely slow, and it is very predictable. The writing does not help much in this regard either, as conversations between characters tend to be a little long-winded and fail to keep the player's attention for long. After attempting to get into the story for the first 10 hours or so of the game, where literally nothing happens, my brain kind of checked out, but that's actually when Eternal Strands started getting good, as it is at this point that what feels like a massive tutorial session ends, and the game proper begins.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241231173835_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At a glance, Eternal Strands doesn't look much different from your typical action-adventure game inspired by The Legend of Zelda. Controlling Brynn with a third-person perspective camera, players explore a variety of mid-sized maps featuring changeable weather conditions, including some extreme magical ones, defeat various enemies ranging from feral beasts to the magical Arks, the guardians of the Enclave, collect items to craft new gear and complete quests and generally try to stay alive as everything in the Enclave and its surroundings seem to want Brynn dead. It's the details, however, that make the difference in Eternal Strands' case. While exploration mechanics never truly take off (although they do improve as more magical powers are unlocked) since there isn't a whole lot to discover in maps besides items of interest that provide additional information on the game's universe and blueprints for new gear, it's the combat that truly elevates the experience, especially in the fights against the bigger enemies where the game turns into a unique combination between Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus.</p>
<p>While the three available basic weapons - sword and shield, two-hander, and bow - don't feel particularly satisfying to use, at least in their basic, non-elemental variations, also due to the limited stamina pool - the special powers Brynn can learn during the course of the adventure definitely succeed in that regard. Thanks to the game's advanced simulation mechanics, the entire game world essentially becomes a huge playground for the player to experiment with.</p>
<p>Fighting multiple enemies at the same time? Hurl them against one another. An enemy is way too mobile for your taste? Freeze them in place. Enemies are standing on leaves? Set them on fire to watch these enemies melt away. These are only a couple of the most basic things that can be done in Eternal Strands thanks to its physics engine, as multiple powers can be combined together for maximum efficacy. For example, it is essentially possible to create some sort of magical cannon to hurl debris at enemies, even flying ones; to make another, it is possible to use a gravity bomb of sorts that attracts everything in its vicinity to create a pressurized fire or ice bomb that will go off after some time to unleash elemental attacks in a wider range.</p>
<p>These elemental attacks also interact with the environment and with specific enemy types in a lot of different ways, forcing the player to adapt to the situation to win against some of them. Some enemies, for example, are covered in thick armor, and to damage them, you will need to find a way to make the armor brittle. In other cases, they have a massive shield that absorbs all damage, and you will need to get rid of this shield to damage them. Depending on how the enemy is defeated, they have higher chances of dropping specific items, so it's always a good idea to get creative and either burn or freeze enemies to death if you're looking for a certain material.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250103012516_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The similarities with Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus emerge in Eternal Strands when fighting the big enemies featured in the game, the Epics. Much like in Fumito Ueda's masterpiece, it is possible to climb on these big enemies to hit their weak points and defeat them, all the while using the elemental powers to gain some sort of advantage. The first time Brynn encounters them, she can defeat them by simply depleting their health to obtain a new power, but to further enhance this power, it will be necessary to absorb their essence, which can only be done after following a specific strategy to expose it, which often involves destroying certain parts of theirs, forcing them to perform certain actions and so on.</p>
<p>What must be done to expose their essence is highlighted in the in-game codex, which does an excellent job at providing hints without saying outright what must be done, although towards the end of the game, once a good understanding of the mechanics has been reached, it becomes possible to expose the big creatures' essences without the codex's help. This is actually a testament to the great enemy design, as the visual clues make the whole operation feel very organic with the combat mechanics. I just wish there were more of these Epic enemies, as fighting mobs becomes stale rather quickly in comparison, especially considering that character progression is limited to crafting new items, including elemental variations of all three weapon types that spice up the experience considerably, giving players more options. So, there aren't many reasons to fight them if the player doesn't need to farm items. However, we do know that more Epics are coming after launch, thanks to the partnership with Square Enix's Creative Studio III, which is helping design new creatures.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, character progression in Eternal Strands is limited to crafting and enhancing gear, and it's in this aspect that the game feels the most like the Monster Hunter series. Each equipment piece, which can only be crafted after finding the appropriate blueprint, comes with a passive skill that alters Brynn's abilities, such as higher health or stamina, faster mana restoration, and so on. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these passive skills are very basic and not particularly exciting, so don't expect to find the same involved build crafting seen in the CAPCOM series. Still, the system definitely has some interesting twists, as it is possible to slightly alter gear abilities by using different materials and even reforge pieces that have already been crafted to enhance them. The materials used also determine the color of the gear, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>While the gameplay loop is definitely simplified over that of the Monster Hunter series, in many ways, Eternal Strands manages to evoke those "one more run" feelings the CAPCOM series does, especially between the 10 and 20-hour mark, as exploration and combat finally become fun after the slog that is the beginning of the adventure. Unfortunately, the experience kind of takes a dive in the second half of the adventure, as it features very little new content.</p>
<p>At this point, all the maps have been discovered, all the big enemies have been fought, and most of the powers obtained and leveled up, taking away the sense of discovery that makes most of the first half of the experience fun, leaving only an uninteresting barrage of quests set in maps the player should know well at that point, and the uneventful story. It's a shame the game is so long, requiring close to 35 hours to complete, as it would have been a much tighter experience if it only ended shortly after unlocking the final map. The lack of new content in the second half of the experience is understandable, considering Yellow Brick Games is a small team, but cutting down the playtime would have been ultimately beneficial, in my opinion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250107190545_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to visuals, Eternal Strands definitely delivers despite not featuring the most advanced graphics to date. Still, Yellow Brick Games took great advantage of the Unreal Engine 5 features to deliver some pleasant and colorful visuals in the vein of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Immortals: Fenyx Rising, giving the entire experience a unique feel with well-detailed fantasy locations and stylized character models that work quite well together.</p>
<p>The developer also managed to keep the known UE5 stuttering issues to a minimum, as the game runs rather well most of the time. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution, epic settings with NVIDIA DLSS at the Ultra Quality setting, and Frame Generation at an average of 118 FPS in a benchmark session held in the Upper Dynevron map, one of the maps featuring the highest enemy density. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation off, the game ran at an average of 89 FPS on the same map, which was extremely playable. The recorded 1% lows, 25 and 35, however, highlight how there's still some stuttering here and there, but it's honestly not that noticeable. Considering the state of the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games and all the taxing simulation the game is doing at almost all times, I was expecting much worse, but there hasn't been a single time in my 35+ hours playthrough where framerates dipped so low the game was unplayable.</p>

<p>Despite the beginning and the end of the adventure being kind of a slog and the predictable story, there's no denying that Eternal Strands is a solid action-adventure game that does a lot of things right, especially its combat mechanics and its fights against giant monsters that masterfully combine mechanics from Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus. Hopefully, Yellow Brick Games will get the chance to do one more entry in the series in the future and tweak the solid foundation they have created to build a better well-rounded experience that can stay fun from beginning to end.</p>

				<p>Despite pulling features and mechanics from a variety of different series, Eternal Strands manages to feel like a cohesive experience that really shines once players get the hang of its advanced physics and combat system. However, the average story and the game's repetitive latter half hold it back from being truly fantastic, making it a solid action-adventure that's just a few steps away from greatness.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, People Can Fly reveals that it'll be working on the game alongside The Coalition, the studio which has stewarded&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>since 2016's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War 4</em>.</p>

<p>People Can Fly says&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>is "deeply embedded in our studio's history" and that the studio has "always been passionate about the series and its legacy". It doesn't reveal exactly what it'll be providing with regards to <i>E-Day</i>'s development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-city.jpg?itok=919e068U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-city.jpg?itok=YG_Anq4m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>will be co-developed by The Coalition and People Can Fly.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio's CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski says it's a "privilege" to return to the <i>Gears of War&nbsp;</i>franchise, promising to build on the series' "intense, visceral action and rich storytelling".</p>

<p>Development director Guillaume Barry adds that People Can Fly is made up of "dedicated&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>fans", and that the studio is "pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations".</p>

<p>For his part, The Coalition studio head Mike Crump says&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>represents "a return to what makes&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>games special and authentic", and says his studio is "pleased" to partner with People Can Fly on the project.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Barry also says People Can Fly "can't share more just yet", so if you were hoping for more details than the scant teaser trailer provides, then you're sadly out of luck.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is, it's a prequel set fourteen years before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">last year's Xbox summer showcase</a>, the game will once again star Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as they deal with the beginnings of the Locust invasion.</p>

<p>We don't know a lot about&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>yet, although we do know it'll <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">focus more</a> on the linear levels for which the series became known rather than the open-ended levels of&nbsp;<em>Gears 5</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010850/Gears_of_War_EDay/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/gears-of-war-eday" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet.

            <p>Look up, planet-lubber. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a> launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second. </p>

<p>That's the new top speed you can travel in this sandbox sequel, we're told. And you don't even need a ship to reach it. Step into the vacuum to discover your boosty backpack will send your little spaceman flyin', so you can catch up to any drifting vessels.</p>

<p>The other new stuff so far includes a fancier graphics engine, a more stable camera while you're wandering on space rocks, undo and redo functions, and the ability to make "blueprints" for quick modular gizmo duplication. Not to mention an improved grid for the block-building system (in short: big, medium, and small blocks now snap together more intuitively).</p><p>The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> slowly dug itself a deep well of features over its own years-long journey through early access. It's one of our reader's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-space-games-of-all-time">best space games</a>. That means developers Keen will be playing a bit of "content catch-up". Their <a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2/#current">development roadmap</a> shows a few plans. They're going to add planets, multiplayer, NPCs, a story mode, and a bunch of other stuff, they say. Although the road map doesn't say exactly when each new shipment of goodies is planned to arrive.</p>
<p>Regardless, I have today strapped myself in to watch the various tutorials and briefing videos Keen Software have been steadily drip-feeding us, like zero-gravity lab rodents. There's a smattering posted on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419466">news feed on Steam</a>. I'll need them. The committee for space antics at RPS has appointed me meteor-explorer-in-chief, and requested a timely review of what this game is like to play so far. I travel in ill-fated footsteps. Not because the previous game was bad - far from it. But because a four-person crew of our finest wayfarers once shot off into that inky frontier and reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-engineers-diary-part-one-wolves">descended into space madness</a> over the course of a few months, culminating in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-and-betrayal-aboard-a-vast-steel-space-spider">a terrible disaster</a>. </p>
<p>I'm sure I'll be fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/escape-room-first-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My main knowledge of escape rooms is that <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8254030/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> where two angry couples are trapped together in a crappy puzzle room, though my perception of them was slanted before that, too; I always imagined them as slightly hokey gimmicks perfectly calibrated to get you to fight with your friends. But I did my first one yesterday, and I actually enjoyed it a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday, four friends and I went to Mysstic Rooms’ “<a href="https://www.myssticrooms.com/rooms/montauk-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montauk Project</a>,” one of several experiences housed in an unassuming building in Brooklyn. The room itself had a loose plot about uncovering a mystery on an old Air Force base; my first surprise came from the fact that it wasn’t just a single locked room. I don’t want to spoil it (the escape room people were very uptight about spoilers, which is fair!), but it involved following a variety of clues and solving puzzles to power items, open padlocks, unlock doors, and uncover secret compartments.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m familiar with solving game puzzles from video games, but it felt really different to solve them in the real world. The physicality of it all heightened the way that game puzzles don’t always make narrative sense (why would moving X object cause Y to happen), but this suspension of disbelief seems necessary to make interesting puzzles to solve. Some of the puzzles got their complexity from requiring solving other puzzles to get their necessary parts, while others were standalone. Some were fairly obvious, while others required steps that wouldn’t have occurred to me and made me glad I was with a group. It was fun to rush around a room opening things and flipping over objects, and rewarding to have a physical response to solving a puzzle correctly.</p><p>The staff member running our room watched our entire hour-long session on a camera and intercom and was available to give us hints if we asked (both they and the website said it was totally OK to ask for hints, which I probably wouldn’t have done on my own). They also weighed in on occasion when they overheard us not being sure if we’d done something right, and in one moment when something accidentally triggered too early. At one point, I wondered aloud to my friends if it drove the staff crazy watching people try to solve the rooms when they knew the solution; the staffer butted in with a deadpan “yes.”</p><p>I was impressed with the way the room was designed to minimize getting stuck on the wrong path. The staffer told us in advance that puzzles were single use, and that the room didn’t require backtracking, which was helpful advice. There was minimal unnecessary decoration, and many things that weren’t clues were bolted down or clearly inoperable. (The staffer told us that people have often broken things in the rooms.) I assumed that a lot of the puzzles were manually operated by the staffer, but they told us afterwards that most of the room ran on sensors and magnets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’m pleased that my friends and I worked together well and didn’t devolve into bickering, especially as time started to run out. After we’d beat the room, our staffer told us they’d seen plenty of people fight, either because of the room or because they seemed to be in a fight when they got there. They also said they’d seen lots of first dates to escape rooms, which seems like a terrible idea for a first date to me, but also an admirably bold choice.</p><p>I was really curious about how the room’s design and staff interaction work with the time limit. Unlike a video game, where you have all the time in the world to poke around and go down dead ends once you buy the game, it seems tough to me to design a physical experience with a firm end, where you’d have to pay and start all over if you couldn’t beat it. I wondered how designers balance making a room hard enough that players would find it fair if they couldn’t solve it, while also making it solvable by a wide range of people without making it too easy. Our staffer told me that there are lots of things they can do behind the scenes to move players along, and that they can decide how much to help depending on how a group is approaching the room and how they seem to feel about solving it. It got me really curious about how escape rooms are designed and playtested, where you have to weigh so many constraints against the limitless ways a group of people might think. (If you are one of our Aftermath readers who works on these kinds of experiences, please weigh in!)</p><p>Overall, I was surprised to enjoy it as much as I did. I’ve played boardgames or <em>D&amp;D</em> with these same friends, but I don’t do a lot of game-playing in the real world or with other people, so it was a nice change of pace. It also got me curious to check out other escape rooms, not something I ever thought I would say. It definitely doesn’t seem like a good first date activity, though.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media"><h3>G/O Media Is Publishing AI Slop Again</h3></a><p>News site Quartz is publishing a whole lot of AI-generated articles</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The challenging times at Ubisoft continue, as the French gaming company has announced it is closing one studio and downsizing others in the firm's latest round of cost-cutting that will see about 185 people lose their jobs. Ubisoft underwent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">multiple waves of layoffs in 2024 as well.</a></p><p>Ubisoft has confirmed that it is closing Ubisoft Leamington, a support studio that contributed to titles like Star Wars Outlaws and Far Cry 5. The team created the DJ Hero series for Activision before being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-buys-guitar-hero-live-dj-hero-dev-from-act/1100-6447034/" data-ref-id="1100-6447034">acquired by Ubisoft in 2017.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft told GameSpot that is is closing Ubisoft Leamington as part of the company's ongoing mission to "prioritize projects and reduce costs." In addition to closing Ubisoft Leamington, Ubisoft is undergoing "targeted restructurings" of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition," Ubisoft said.</p><p>This dramatic action wasn't totally unexpected, as Ubisoft said in a memo to investors in early January that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">continuing to look for ways to "drive significant cost reductions" in the business.</a> Ubisoft added that it will take a "highly selective approach to investments" during this period. In total, Ubisoft said it expects to see a reduction of €200 million ($206 million USD) as part of this plan.</p><p>This is all happening amid reports that have suggested Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">may be working with Tencent on some kind of business arrangement</a> to solidify its future. During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">conference call</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value.</p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft will releases its latest earnings report on February 13, at which time the company may share additional information about its future outlook. The company <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enters a "quiet period" beginning January 29</a>, so no one should expect Ubisoft to make specific announcements about its future business outlook between January 29 and February 13.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/27/ps5-exclusive-rise-of-ronin-is-coming-to-pc-in-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Team Ninja’s PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> is coming to PC on 11th March 2025, Koei Tecmo has revealed, just shy of the first anniversary of its original release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - PC Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4FFRu9HHY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Following on from the Nioh Soulslikes, Team Ninja pivoted with Rise of the Ronin to tell a more traditional historical tale set in the Bakumatsu period of the country’s history. The game features a wide open world and puts the power in your hands to determine how the story unfolds, depending on how you ally yourself with the anti-shogunate faction, pro-shogunate faction, or Western forces.</p>
<p>The PC version is being enhanced well beyond the PS5 original with ultra-wide monitor support, 8K resolution support, 120FPS, ray tracing and more.</p>
<p>Here’s Koei Tecmo’s list of what they’ve done for the game:</p>

<ul>
<li>8K resolution support</li>
<li>DirectX 12 Ultimate support</li>
<li>Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility</li>
<li>120FPS support</li>
<li>Ray tracing support</li>
<li>3D audio support</li>
<li>Customizable keyboard and mouse controls</li>
<li>AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support</li>
<li>UI menu with mouse clickability</li>
<li>Intel XeSS graphics technology support</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those are reaching quite a bit. I don’t think having a clickable UI is big enough of a deal to mention, and mentioning 3D audio here is about supporting PC implementations of 3D audio, where PS5 had support via the Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p>
<p>The game flew under the radar a little by the time that Game of the Year awards rolled around, but Rise of the Ronin was a great exclusive for PS5 early in 2024. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/rise-of-the-ronin-review/">In our own review we scored it a stellar 9/10</a>, Aran saying that “Rise of the Ronin is a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-lays-off-yet-more-employees-and-closes-another-office.1092858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has closed down yet another studio and laid off almost 200 employees, with a support outfit in the UK being shuttered and three studios undergoing "targeted restructurings", i.e. layoffs.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, a spokesperson for Ubisoft said the closure and downsizings were "part of our ongoing efforts to prioritize projects and reduce costs" in order to "ensure long-term stability".</p>

<p>As such, the company's Leamington branch, a support studio that's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, will be closed entirely, while Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections will be downsized. Overall, Ubisoft is letting go 185 of its employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-leamington-closing-layoffs-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=FrD3gmu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-leamington-closing-layoffs-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=lpG68lAn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>support studio Ubisoft Leamington is no more.</figcaption></figure><p>The cost-cutting measures to which Ubisoft refers have already seen it close down its San Francisco and Osaka branches, the former being responsible for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">developing the flop multiplayer FPS&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>that flopped, either; two high-profile releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>(both of which Leamington worked on as a support studio), <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">contributed to a $285 million loss</a> for the company in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's woes don't end there, either. Having likely banked on the November release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>to bolster its finances, the game was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed to February</a>, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">again to March</a>.</p>

<p>As if that wasn't enough, the company is also facing unrest from its shareholders, some of whom have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a>&nbsp;and expressed "deep dissatisfaction" with what they see as the direction in which the studio is currently heading.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-leamington-closure.jpg?itok=I3xrNZE8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-leamington-closure.jpg?itok=7kTrshzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is likely banking on a big success with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid reports that company boss Yves Guillemot and major shareholder Tencent are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">considering taking the company private</a>, another potential force to be reckoned with on this front is the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">reportedly provided funding</a> for new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, Ubisoft desperately needs a big hit if it's going to dig itself out of the rut in which it's found itself. For the sake of the company, let's hope&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is that hit.

            <p>It's been a veritable Koei Tecmo offensive on PC recently - the kind one could only reasonably attribute to a flurry of panic over stock prices (boring, bad) or else a sheer compulsion to drown us in lots of very agile men with very sharp swords (fun and good). First, there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-1">enjoyed quite a bit</a>. Then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/koei-tecmo-surprise-release-ninja-gaiden-2-black-definitive-unreal-remaster-of-the-2008-hack-and-slash">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black got a surprise release</a>. Now, we're getting Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise Of The Ronin</a> this coming March - the 11th to be precise. I'd do a bit about stealth drops but I'm at the point where using game-thematic verbs makes me want to collapse on a bed of caltrops, throat first. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>"An open-world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>set in the Bakumatsu period," says the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/">Steam page</a>, "where players take on the role of a ronin forging their own destiny. The game features multiple possible endings, allowing players to choose which faction to support—such as the anti-shogunate faction, pro-shogunate faction, or Western forces—which significantly alters the story's outcome."</p>

<p>Rise Of The Ronin had a decent reception on release. It's currently sitting at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/rise-of-the-ronin/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5">76 on Metacritic</a>, if that means anything to you. It's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> RPG hybrid featuring the typically deep combat you'd expect from Team Ninja. "Hardcore action for the mainstream," reckoned our siblings-in-Ziff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">Eurogamer</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-not-the-ninja-splinter-cell-game-i-hoped-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I visited Ubisoft Quebec last year to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">see Assassin’s Creed Shadows for the first time</a>, I was encouraged by the development team’s enthusiasm for stealth. While I’ve enjoyed Assassin’s Creed’s foray into RPG territory, after hundreds of action-heavy hours I think it’s about time the series rediscovered its sneakier genes. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirage-looks-backwards-when-it-should-leap-forward">Not by way of Mirage’s “back to basics” approach</a>, but by reaching forward to provide some much-needed evolution in the series’ stealth design. Shadows’ promise of a Splinter Cell-style lighting system had me excited, but after playing a three-hour demo build, I’m not quite convinced that it’s delivering a meaningful change for Assassin’s Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo’s quest chain, set in Harima Province, had me infiltrating a variety of strongholds, from small gardens with just a couple of guards to towering castles packed with opponents. If you’ve played an Assassin’s Creed before, the fundamental approach to all this is practically unchanged; you’ll be scaling to highpoints to identify guard placements, using simple distraction techniques to create opportunities, and stabbing a lot of people in the neck with a hidden blade. All of this can be achieved using the same techniques you’ve relied upon for years, and many of the flaws that have previously hampered such techniques also make a return. For example, the hidden blade can once again be foiled by high-level opponents, neutering planning and positioning in favour of skill points and upgrades. Incredibly sticky environments continue to be the norm, which ensures you never fall from a rooftop or slip during an ascent, but being glued to surfaces often proves catastrophic when it comes to quickly reacting to enemy threats. Emergency escapes feel like you’re fighting against a magnetic leash that really wants to lock you in a bad place.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/ac-shadows-stealth-perch-1737639577960.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shadows' approach to stealth is fundamentally unchanged. Satisfying, but static. (Image source: Ubisoft)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read IGN's recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-the-final-preview">hands-on preview</a> you’ll know that our writer, Alessandro, really enjoyed Shadows’ revamped take on stealth. While I feel differently, having left Ubisoft’s playtest room somewhat disappointed, it’s important to note that Shadows <em>is </em>fulfilling its promise of taking stealth seriously. One of its two playable characters is Naoe, a ninja wholly dedicated to stealth. Aside from the prologue in which I had to play as combat-focused Yasuke for tutorial purposes, I was able to play as Naoe for the entire duration of the demo. While Shadows often asks if you’d like to switch roles, it had no issue with me choosing Naoe every single time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Standing notably shorter than her heavily armoured companion, Naoe is able to avoid enemy sightlines more easily. Her slender frame allows her to do things the bulkier Yasuke can not, such as slip through narrow gaps and hide in boxes, while her grappling hook opens up access to rooftops and ledges that have no climbing handholds. Playing as Naoe opens up new routes and pathways through Shadows’ world… or perhaps, more accurately, playing as Yasuke closes the door on many established Assassin’s Creed traditions. He’s unable to perform any of the series’ staple stealth actions, aside from using his bow for silent ranged attacks.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those stealth staples become more interesting (at least on paper) thanks to refreshed ideas. Shadows’ title partly refers to its new approach to detection. Staying in the dark renders you invisible to enemies, and the closer you move towards a light source the more visible you become. This is clearly spelled out by a meter on your HUD that fills and empties as you move around. The clever bit, though, is that you can manipulate the environment to create advantages. Lanterns can be destroyed with blades or thrown shurikens, plunging rooms into darkness so that you may draw blood completely unseen. It's an idea that was prevalent in the era of Thief and Splinter Cell, but has fallen by the wayside since stealth largely became an optional approach in action games rather than its own dedicated genre.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found the presence of light rarely impacted my progress or forced me to devise smarter methods of approach.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The adoption of this approach sounds like a complete game changer, but in reality it had minimal impact on a playstyle I’ve honed across 13 prior games. I don’t doubt that, under the hood, the engine’s enemy AI routines <em>are </em>influenced by this new simulation. But when it comes to actually playing Shadows, I found the presence of light rarely impacted my progress or forced me to devise smarter methods of approach. I could stand on rooftops with a full visibility meter and no one would see me. Traditional sightlines seemed to be the only factor I truly had to consider. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sense of same-but-different persists across many of Shadows’ ideas. Naoe is able to lie prone and crawl on her stomach, which certainly did make a difference when it came to invisible repositioning. But the environment I encountered in the demo made little creative use of this ability. For example, I was disappointed to discover that a tunnel beneath a house didn’t have a hatchway into the room above. Instead of acting as an alternative entry point, all this crawlspace offered was the same pathway that could be faster accomplished by simply scaling across the rooftop. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A more positive shift can be found in the positioning of enemies, with encounters offering an increased challenge over Mirage’s overly-simple arrangements. I was caught out more than a couple of times by overlapping vision cones and patrols, and the resulting high alert state does seem to make guards more persistent in their hunt for you than in previous games. Simply hiding on a roof and tracking foes using eagle vision did seem enough to easily avoid them, though, at least on the default difficulty. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of the better guard placements, there is an increased and welcome emphasis on assessment and planning. Gone is the drone-like bird of the last few games, replaced with an over-the-shoulder zoom, meaning scouting and marking enemies can only be done from your own sightline. It’s a good change, one that forces you to explore an area on foot and spend more time considering your angles of approach. But when it comes to executing a plan, things return to the very familiar. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/ac-shadows-naoe-stealth-1737640062317.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Naoe can call in burly NPCs to cause distractions. (Image credit: Ubisoft)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe’s toolbelt holds kunai throwing knives for insta-kill headshots and smoke bombs for concealing attacks and escapes, both of which are necessary but vanilla stealth tools. The same can be said for repositioning guards, which is done either by luring them to your position with a whistle, or baiting them to a specific spot with a thrown bell. There’s the obvious combos, such as encouraging a guard towards an explosive barrel that you then detonate with a throwing knife. But beyond that, at least in this demo, there didn’t seem to be the canvas for anything more experimental or exciting.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>To choose a stealth character and then be forced to engage in direct combat with a boss does feel like being told your decision is invalid.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows seems reliant on a lean and familiar set of abilities, at least as far as stealth goes. Even options that initially seem to be fresh are repackaged tools from the past; you can call on an allied brawler to charge at a designated target, which works as both a distraction and a method of remotely eliminating enemies, but this is really just a thematically different take on the berserk darts that have appeared in a number of prior Assassin’s Creed games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe does have a detailed skill tree, allowing you to build and hone her abilities beyond those standard tools. But all the exciting options are combat focussed, such as the elaborate nine-strike Guard Breaker, or Eviscerate with its kick-flip finisher. When it comes to stealth, the most exotic option I could find was the ability to slow down time for a few seconds. As far as this demo was willing to show me, there’s nothing along the lines of traps, disguises, or other more advanced stealth ideas. Perhaps the changing of the seasons, which I didn’t get to experience and is promised to change the landscape considerably, is where Shadows’ more interesting stealth challenges lie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, the toughest challenges I faced were direct clashes. Shadows effectively has two combat systems; Yasuke’s feels like a direct continuation of Valhalla, but tuned up to feel significantly swifter and a little more tactical. I liked it a lot, at least as far as I could tell in the limited time I played as him. Naoe, meanwhile, is nowhere near as strong as her samurai counterpart and so takes considerably more damage and cannot block as effectively. This forces her fight style to prioritise dodging and staying nimble. I really like the concept that drives this – that each character provides a distinctly different version of the same experience – but on the battlefield I found myself frustrated. Playing as Naoe, it feels like the rhythm of combat runs at a different tempo to the attack animations, and so I constantly tripped up over awkwardly-timed dodge and parry windows. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In most instances, the brutal punishment inflicted by combat forced me to take stealth seriously. Its classic carrot vs stick stuff, and an effective stick at that. What I’m less enthusiastic about is my pure stealth playthrough being derailed by mandatory bosses with huge health bars. I wish, when playing as Naoe, these bosses were reconfigured as stealth-focused assassination challenges in the mould of Assassin’s Creed Unity’s centrepiece missions. Instead I’m forced to defeat my foe in a one-on-one duel that’s clearly designed to fulfill the samurai fantasy side of Shadows' offering. I appreciate that Shadows always gives you the option to switch to Yasuke (and prior to one of these fights even prompted me to), but to choose a stealth character and then be forced to engage in direct combat does feel like being told your decision is invalid. Maybe, with several more hours of practice and a combat tune-up prior to release, duelling with Naoe will feel less like a punishment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After three hours of play, I’m fairly confident in saying that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be the best stealth experience of the series’ RPG era. Having a character and toolkit entirely dedicated to the approach signifies that Ubisoft is taking this fundamental part of the franchise seriously for what feels like the first time in many years. But, as dedicated fans will know, stealth never actually went away – it was just eclipsed by the action. Shadows lets that stealth step back into the limelight. However, just because stealth now has prominence doesn’t mean it's undergone any meaningful change. For all the studio’s talk of Splinter Cell-like detection systems, Shadows feels like Assassin’s Creed getting back to business as usual rather than exploring a new, sneakier frontier. For many exhausted by the reign of Spartans and Vikings, that will likely be enough. But if what I’ve played is representative of Shadows as a whole, I think Ubisoft has missed a huge opportunity to capitalise on the advanced stealth potential of one of history’s most recognisable clandestine assassin groups. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Games is reportedly producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-is-reportedly-in-the-works/1100-6527135/" data-ref-id="1100-6527135">Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition</a> with additional story content, but that has yet to be officially announced. All we know for sure is that Warner Bros. is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">making a sequel</a> a priority for the gaming division. But if you still need a PC copy of Hogwarts Legacy, it's currently on sale for $16.19 at Fanatical.</p><p>However--like all Harry Potter products--J.K. Rowling's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">comments about the trans community</a> continue to haunt the community. Even after years of backlash, she continuously shares her anti-trans views online and via social media. This has put Rowling at odds with several of the actors from the Harry Potter films, as well as a large number of her fans. Regardless, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-aiming-to-release-in-2026/1100-6521317/" data-ref-id="1100-6521317">upcoming Harry Potter TV series</a> is still coming to HBO and Max.</p><p><em>Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

                <p>Following its recent launch on PC, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth broke a concurrent-players record on Steam for single-player entries in the franchise over the weekend. The RPG--which initially launched on PS5 in February 2024--saw over 40,000 people exploring the game with Cloud Strife and his friends.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-highest-steam-peak-for-series-single-player-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> reports that Final Fantasy XVI hit over 27,000 concurrent players on Steam last year.

<h2 id="section-1">New Magic: The Gathering in 2025 Features</h2>

<h3 id="section-2">Headliners</h3>



<p>Starting with <em>Innistrad Remastered</em>, 2025 premieres Headliners – a new part of the ongoing booster fun initiative. This means a single card from the set has been given special treatments and illustrations to be unique. This can include serialization, like we see with the first two Headliners of the year in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inr/234/edgar-markov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Edgar Markov">Edgar Markov </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/231/the-aetherspark" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Aetherspark">The Aetherspark</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section-3">Japan Showcase Cards</h3>



<p>Continuing from the end of last year, Japanese Showcase Cards will be in at least some of 2025’s sets, after debuting in Duskmourn. These are a few (so far 10 each time) cards that have been given alternate art by Japanese artists, and appear only in collector boosters. They appear in about 10% of collector boosters, and 10% of those will have the Japan Showcase exclusive fracture foiling.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Secret Lair Changes to Magic: The Gathering in 2025</h2>

<p>Wizards Secret Lair program is seeing changes this year as they attempt to innovate with it, and address ongoing problems.</p>

<h3 id="section-5">Chaos Vault</h3>

<p>On the experimental side of things, Wizards <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wizards of the Coast Announces Their First Chaos Vault Drop for Magic: The Gathering">introduced the Chaos Vault </a>this year, where they promise to have unusual items, at unusual times. This is where we’re going to see some of the product innovation it appears, and we have seen a couple of things so far. So far they have experimented with a foil only drop, and changing the way they <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Latest Secret Lair Chaos Vault Previews Psychedelic Land Cards">handle basic land drops </a>in the first two this year.</p>

<h3 id="section-6">Distributing Mechanically Unique Secret Lair Cards</h3>

<p>Without The List to put Universes Within versions of mechanically unique secret lair cards, Wizards has worked out a few ideas on how to fulfill the promise of making these cards available outside of ordering via the Secret Lair website. While reprints in sets are an option, another is via promo distribution, such as they are doing with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-magic-presents-spring-flourishes-event-showcases-new-dd-themed-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Upcoming Magic Presents: Spring Flourishes Event Showcases New D&amp;D-Themed Cards"><em>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves </em>secret lair cards</a>.<br><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dnd-secret-lair-bohn-rashel-and-mathise.jpg?itok=-yjpg5NK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dnd-secret-lair-bohn-rashel-and-mathise.jpg?itok=t5KwmCC5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture></p>

<p>The bigger experiment though, is that Wizards of the Coast will be allowing <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/a-secret-lair-test-is-coming-to-your-local-wpn-game-store" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="A Secret Lair Test Is Coming to Your Local WPN Game Store">game stores to sell secret lairs</a> that have mechanically unique cards. This won’t solve all the issues people have, but should make them more available.</p>



<p>2025 will have 6 standard legal, tentpole set releases, with three of them being universes beyond sets. Additionally, Innistrad Remastered will be coming out, though its cards will retain whatever current legality they have, much like they have for past remastered sets.</p>

<p>The reduction in the number of sets released this year to ‘only’ 6 has meant that they have decided to delay the release of the previously announced set codenamed Wrestling. Announced back in 2023 as part of their longterm showing, Wrestling is a return to the plane of Lorwyn/Shadowmoor, a celtic inspired plane of duality. It was scheduled to release in 2025, but now will instead be the first set released in 2026.</p>

<h3 id="section-8">Innistrad Remastered</h3>



<p><strong>Release date: January 24</strong></p>

<p>The first release of 2025 is magic’s latest remaster set, this time taking us to the horror plane of Innistrad. Like past remaster sets, this is all reprints, and it’s of cords that have ties to the plane of Innistrad.</p>

<p>One small change here is that the card’s don’t need to have been printed in an Innistrad set before. These cards do need to fit the set, and either depict Innistrad, or appear to be cards that could have been printed there in the past. The most notable reprint introduced in this way is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inr/202/hermit-druid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hermit Druid">Hermit Druid</a>, a card that hasn’t been printed in a paper set since 1995, outside of an appearance on The List.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: Edgar Markov</strong></p>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edgar-markov-headliner.jpg?itok=ASjv1v45 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edgar-markov-headliner.jpg?itok=8-8h5q1E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><br>
The Headliner program starts with Innistrad Remastered and we see that Edgar Markov gets to appear in several different ways. In any pack he can be in a standard, retro border, or fang treatment (from Innistrad: Crimson Vow). Exclusively in collector boosters though he can be in a secret lair style movie poster, as a serialized card out of 500.</p>

<h3 id="section-9">Aetherdrift</h3>

<p><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aetherdrift-key-art.jpg?itok=CfiusYHK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aetherdrift-key-art.jpg?itok=N0_91uvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><br><strong>Release Date: February 14</strong></p>

<p>Magic’s first attempt at a ‘travelogue’ set, <em>Aetherdrift </em>is Magic’s take on racing, in particular the death race area. It involves the planes of Avishkar (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Aetherdrift Brings Wacky Races and New Name for an Old Plane to Magic: The Gathering">formerly known as Kaladesh</a>), Amonkhet, and Muraganda, as ten teams race across them representing each two color pairing.</p>

<p>The set leans into its themes of racing and features a large number of vehicles, and mounts, with new mechanics designed to further and complement the theme. A number of callbacks, and cameo mechanics to past visits to Amonkhet and Avishkar are also present, as well as the first time we’re seeing more of Murganda.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: The Aetherspark</strong></p>



<p>The Headliner for Aetherdrift is the grand prize of the race itself, The Aetherspark, the first ever Planeswalker card with another type. The headliner version of The Aetherspark is like Edgar Markov, in that it is a borderless, serialized (out of 500), double rainbow foiled card only findable in collector boosters. This version also has distinct art, though it’s much more normal than the poster art of Edgar Markov.</p>

<p><strong>First Place Foils</strong></p>

<p>Coming in Box Toppers and Finish Line Bundles, First Place Foils are a new type of foiling process that goes heavy on the . To get one of these, you need to buy a Play or Collector booster box, or the Finish Line Bundles. The special packs they come in will have 2 cards, 1 of 10 basic lands in First Place Foil, and 1 of 127 Rare or Mythic Rares in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aetherdrift-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aetherdrift Commander Decklists">Commander decks for Aetherdrift</a>, a marked decline from the normal 4 we have seen recently. They are Living Energy (a green/blue/red Energy focused deck), and Eternal Might (a white/blue/black Zombie focused deck).</p>

<h3 id="section-10">Tarkir: Dragonstorm</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: April 11</strong><br>
A decade has passed since we last saw the mighty plane of Tarkir, and we return to it in <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em>. We’ve seen various dragons appearing in odd spots in sets (like in <em>Bloomburrow</em>) because of the Dragonstorm, and it appears here we might learn some of what is going on.</p>

<p><em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> will take a best of both approach in regards to what parts of the first block it will capture: there are going to be dragons, and there will be the wedge-aligned clan factions. We can also expect the return of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mat/46/sarkhan-soul-aflame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sarkhan, Soul Aflame">Sarkhan Vol </a>(desparked as of March of the Machines Aftermath), and more ominously Ugin, who retains his spark but has left his guardianship of Nicol Bolas for some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know what the Headliner for <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>will be at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong><br>
We have no knowledge of what Commander decks will be distributed with Tarkir: Dragonstorm at this time.</p>

<h3 id="section-11">Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: June 13</strong></p>

<p>The first of the direct to standard Universes Beyond sets will be the <em>Final Fantasy </em>set releasing in June. This set will feature aspects of games all across the <em>Final Fantasy </em>series, with some favorite characters confirmed already to be represented. Cloud, Terra, Lightning, and Noctis, will all be in the set, alongside summons, monsters, chocobos, and more in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong></p>

<p>We don’t know what the Headliner for <em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy </em>will be, or even if the Headliner program will be used with Universes Beyond sets like this one.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks: TBA</strong></p>

<p>We don’t know anything at this point about Commander Decks for <em>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section-12">Edge of Eternities</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: August 1</strong></p>

<p>For the first time, Magic: The Gathering is heading out into the blind eternities, that space in the multiverse between planes. <em>Edge of Eternities </em>will be a science fantasy set, this will involve Magic’s take on the space opera genre as it takes place beyond the edge of the known multiverse in heretofore unknown Sothera system.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: Sothera, The Supervoid</strong></p>



<p>We don’t know much of anything about Sothera, merely that it was announced to be the headliner card when they were showing off future sets, and teasing 2025 content.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know what Commander Decks will be released along with <em>Edge of Eternities</em>.</p>

<h3 id="section-13">Marvel’s Spider-Man</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: Final Quarter Of 2025</strong></p>

<p>Set to release sometime in September or later, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> will be the first of several Marvel sets releasing over the next few years. As the set’s name implies, this one will be focused on Spider-Man and will be based on the original comics, not the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of the webslinger. Like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, it will be standard legal, and distributed in normal boosters.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know what the Headliner for <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man </em>will be, or even if the Headliner program will be used with Universes Beyond sets like this one.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong></p>

<p>We don’t know anything at this point about Commander Decks for Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p>

<h3 id="section-14">Unannounced Universes Beyond Set</h3>



<p><strong>Release Date: After Spider-Man In Final Quarter of 2025</strong></p>

<p>Our final release of 2025 is a large mystery still, with Wizard’s not announcing what Universes Beyond this will be. It will be the final release of the year, and come out sometime in the year after Spider-Man releases. It will be Standard legal, and be a randomized booster product.</p>

<p><strong>Headliner: TBA</strong><br>
We don’t know anything more about this set at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Decks</strong><br>
We really don’t know what this set will be.</p>

One talon is shown doing 150 damage to one of the training bots in the game’s practice range. There does appear to be some kind of damage drop-off, as one bot who is further away from the talon’s impact zone seemingly only takes the advertised 75 damage. Sidewaysgts hypothesizes that each talon may be producing two AoE fields, but it’s unclear if this is a bug or if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> lacks clarity on how the ability works.</p><p>Bug or not, Moon Knight’s ult is one of the most powerful in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>right now, thanks to casting so quickly and killing most characters in seconds, all for little effort.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-responds-to-saudi-deal-report/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has issued a response, somewhat, to recent reports regarding a deal with Saudi Arabia.  </p>



<p>Late last week, French newspaper Les Echoes (<a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywall</a>) reported that Ubisoft had reached an agreement with the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group to develop new content for 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage. The Savvy Games Group is financially backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF)</p>



<p>In a response given to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft wouldn’t confirm nor deny that a deal with the group had been reached.</p>



<p>“We’ll decline to comment,” a Ubisoft spokesperson told the outlet. “We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;and excited for players to get to play it on 20th March.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-nbsp-xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developers Direct Us: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Ubisoft is currently in the middle of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-explore-all-company-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“exploring company options”</a> in order to turn things around for a company whose value has continued to fall in recent years. Those options also include a potential deal with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese company Tencent</a>, where both companies are in talks for a new venture centered around Ubisoft’s current assets.</p>



<p>At the time of the latter’s report, Insider Gaming understood that no decision or direction had been reached at the time. The belief is that the company is waiting on the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows before making any sort of decision about its future.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is currently scheduled to release its Q3 FY2025 earnings on February 13. It’s likely some sort of update on where things stand for the company will be announced during the call.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s lack of a denial regarding the reported deal with Savvy Games Group for Mirage DLC? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft is set to close its UK studio based in Leamington, as it sheds 185 jobs across the business. 
</p>
<p>Leamington had a team of around 50 people - a small number of whom will be retained under remote contracts. Additionally, Ubisoft offices in Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte), Stockholm and the Newcastle-based Ubisoft Reflections will be downsized.</p>
<p>
"As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site," a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement to Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition."
</p>
<p>Founded in 2002 as FreeStyleGames by a group of former Rare and Codemasters veterans, Ubisoft Leamington had most recently worked as a support studio on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a> series, and also assisted development on games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>.</p><p>In its heyday, under its previous ownership by Activision, Leamington was best known for its DJ Hero games, before it was put to work on the publisher's Guitar Hero and Call of Duty franchises. Ubisoft then acquired the firm in 2017.
</p>
<p>As for the teams that have been downsized, Ubisoft Düsseldorf is best known for developing Anno and The Settlers, while Ubisoft Stockholm most recently worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> with Massive Entertainment. Ubisoft Reflections, the veteran team originally founded in 1984 and acquired by Ubisoft in 2006, had been working closely with Leamington supporting AAA game development.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft's latest layoffs come as the company continues to try and cut costs after a string of disappointing game launches <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">including the failure of big budget bet Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">the shutdown of live-service shooter XDefiant</a>, and repeated delays to Assassin's Creed Shadows amidst wider concern for the firm's future.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">repeatedly reduced its headcount</a> since 2022, when it employed 20,279 people. By the end of September 2024, Ubisoft employed 18,666.
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Ubisoft said it was "taking decisive steps" to reshape the company</a>, in order to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". 
</p>
<p>
Reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">previously suggested</a> Ubisoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">keen to take the company private</a> via investment from Chinese giant Tencent, although company boss Yves Guillemot wanting to retain overall control has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">allegedly proven a sticking point</a>. All eyes now turn to the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows on 20th March, whose success has never seemed more vital.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives-and-follow-xbox%E2%80%99s-strategy-moon-studios-ceo-believes.1092771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Console exclusivity will eventually become a thing of the past for PlayStation as it has with Xbox, due to how consoles and the market as a whole have changed, the Moon Studios CEO believes.</p>
<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler talked about Xbox's current approach, saying that it is the right one for several reasons. A few years back, the studio decided not to make&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Rest for the Wicked</a> under Microsoft because it would have prevented the game from being released on PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch and would have impacted the game considerably as the studio felt that multiplayer and cross-play are an important part of the experience.</p>
<p>Elaborating further on the limitations of console exclusivity, the Moon Studios CEO gives a very interesting example. Over the years of communicating with Phil Spencer, Thomas Mahler always brought up how crazy it would be if certain DVDs would only play on players made by certain manufacturers. If this is crazy for movies, Mahler asks, then why is it different with games, considering how both PlayStation and Xbox consoles are powered by essentially the same hardware and have the same controller? At the same time, the console audience hasn't been growing, and for the entire industry to grow, access to content must be easier. This is achieved by reducing the cost of entry, which is what Microsoft is doing with its current strategy. For these reasons, Thomas Mahler concludes, he would be surprised if Sony didn't follow Microsoft's strategy, and bring an end to the days of PlayStation exclusive releases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I know some people always want me to join the console warring, but I strongly believe that <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@XboxP3</a> has the right approach.</p>
<p>We decided a few years back not to make <a href="https://twitter.com/wickedgame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wickedgame</a> under Microsoft because back then we couldn’t have shipped it for PlayStation and Switch and since we… <a href="https://t.co/A0913IXMkx">https://t.co/A0913IXMkx</a></p>
<p>— thomasmahler (@thomasmahler) <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasmahler/status/1883273827284599091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft started doing away with Xbox exclusives last year and has since released multiple games on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, including Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Sea of Thieves. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Microsoft Flight Simulator, Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">others</a> also rumored to launch on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2, it will be very interesting to learn if Microsoft's strategy will pay off in such a big way that Sony will consider following suit.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hogwarts Legacy Mod Support Update Coming This Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-coming-this-week.1092768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizarding RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official mod support via an update this week, developer Avalanche Studios and publisher Warner Bros. Games have revealed.</p>

<p>Launching on January 30th, the update will not only add modding support to the game, but it'll also bring official modding tools that will allow&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>'s players to create mods even if they don't have much modding experience.</p>

<p>In a new video explaining modding for <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, community manager Chandler Wood explains how modding will work in the game. It turns out you'll be using a tool called the&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Creator Kit, which will be available via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=nj3jSR0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-mod-support-update-toolkit.jpg?itok=mO0uYwGH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is getting official modding support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Wood doesn't specify whether you'll be able to find the Creator Kit on Steam, nor does he say whether you'll be able to use the Epic version of the kit to play mods via the Steam version of <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i>. I can only imagine the game's community will have something to say about it if not.</p>

<p>Mods can range from character cosmetics and "small touches" through to entire dungeons and quests. Wood also confirms that Avalanche has been working with&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modders to ensure you'll have something to play as soon as the update launches.</p>

<p>You'll only be able to access&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>modding if you're playing on PC, unfortunately. It doesn't seem like mod support or the modding toolkit will be coming to the console versions of the game.</p>

<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>launched back in 2023, and it's proven to be a massive success for Warner Bros. Games, selling over <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">30 million copies</a> at last count. Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">how bad the publisher's 2024 was</a>, that continued success will likely come as a balm.</p>




<p>A sequel for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and it's also been reported that WB Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">working on a Director's Cut version</a> of the game, with staffers from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady reportedly helping out on the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts_Legacy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hogwarts-legacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hogwarts-legacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the modding update launches on January 30th.</p>
