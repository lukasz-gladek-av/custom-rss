              <p>Having all your games in one place is not as impossible as it might seem. But with modern games pushing 100GB or more, the built-in storage on the Xbox Series X or S just doesn’t go far. The easiest way to boost your storage capacity is by getting your hands on a dedicated expansion card like this one from Seagate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">The massive 4TB version is now 24% off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $380</a>. It’s the largest officially licensed Xbox expansion card available on the market, but the deal might not be around for too long. We recommend acting fast to grab yourself one while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Enough Capacity for All Your Favorite Titles</h2>
<p>This expansion card is built in partnership with Xbox, so you can expect it to match the performance of your console’s internal SSD. Xbox Velocity Architecture support makes for fast load times and sharp graphics without any slowdowns. You can also play the games directly from the card without needing to transfer files back and forth. Simply insert it into the expansion slot on the back of your Xbox Series X or S, and it’s ready to go – literally within minutes.</p>
<p>The 4TB storage capacity is enough to house all your treasured titles across four generations of Xbox consoles. So, whether you’re after the latest releases or still can’t part ways with your Xbox 360 favorites, this card has enough room to keep everything in one place. Quick Resume support lets you jump between several games without losing your progress, both from the internal SSD and the expansion card. The switch is quick and will be especially appreciated by players who rotate between different games. You could be playing as a single player one minute, and then jumping into action with your friends the next!</p>



<p>Next-gen features are also taken care of. Plus, you’re getting a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Should there be any issues down the line, you’re covered.</p>
<p>Altogether, this card does not just offer extra storage for your games. It also keeps up with the performance of your console. It’s designed around the Xbox Velocity Architecture, so speeds and output is going to be the same as what you get from your internal SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">It’s now down to $380, which is a $120 discount on the retail price of $500. If 4TB is too much space for you, consider going for the 1TB or 2TB version.</a></p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has a long list of Digimon available to add to your collection, though some are harder to obtain than others and require Digi-Eggs to be unlocked.</p>



<p>Time Stranger has plenty to sink your teeth into, ranging from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Digimon Personalities</a> that provide stat boosts to the exact requirements needed to Digivolve into specific forms. Naturally, it’s impossible to remember everything.</p>



<p>That’s where we come in, though, as we’ve got all the details on every Digimon Story: Time Stranger Digi-Egg and how you can get your hands on them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Digi-Eggs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Egg Thief! Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 varieties of Digi-Egg in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, all of which must be crafted in order for them to be obtained.</strong></p>



<p>Materials for crafting are gathered in both the human world and digital world, so exploration is key, and you’ll also require specific Attachments for the crafting recipe. However, you can remove them from Digimon if they are already equipped to them.</p>



<p>Aside from that, you’ll also require a hefty amount of Yen, as each Digi-Egg requires 10,000 yen. These eggs don’t hatch either; instead, they’re used to unlock specific Digivolutions.</p>



<p>A full list of Digi-Eggs in Digimon Story: Time Stranger and the required materials are shown in the table below. We’ve also detailed the Digivolutions they are needed for.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-digi-eggs-in-digimon-story-time-stranger">How to Get Digi-Eggs in Digimon Story: Time Stranger</h2>



<p><strong>Digi-Eggs only become available for crafting when you have unlocked Volcanusmon’s Crafting Shop via story progress in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Defeating Volcanusmon during the Incoming Conflict main mission unlocks the Crafting Shop, which is then the necessary point to visit for crafting Digi-Eggs.</p>



<p>Once this point in the story has been met, you can freely return to Volcanusmon’s Crafting Shop at any time to craft Digi-Eggs.</p>

            <p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games, has been delayed but is "<em>so</em> close to being done".</p>
<p>The Zelda-like adventure was intended for release on 31st October, but has been pushed back without a new release date, though the developer has stated it "isn't a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p>
<p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That's no hollow promise!" the studio stated.</p>

<p>"We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line."</p>
<p>Yacht Club Games made its name with celebrated platformer Shovel Knight, which spawned a number of spin-offs.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a change of pace, featuring a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world.</p>
<p>It continues the studio's penchant for retro aesthetics, then. Victoria <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">checked out the demo on Switch 2</a> a couple of months back and loved it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world%E2%80%99s-horror-themed-%E2%80%98nighthaven%E2%80%99-season-looks-so-good-it-has-players-eager-to-dive-back-into-the-mmorpg.1318264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>, the relaunch of Amazon's MMORPG that introduced console versions with cross-play and a lot more. The developers were certainly hoping to get a big boost to the active player base, but that didn't quite happen.</p>



<p>However, that might change next week with the upcoming debut of Season 10, which is already garnering a lot of interest among MMO fans. Admittedly, it's not the most exciting time in the genre; sure, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2 expansion Visions of Eternity</a> due later this month, and ZeniMax will release the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online, while Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has opened the Alpha test of World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. But all those games are pretty old (if not very, very old) at this point. The only new MMORPG release of the year will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pax Dei's 1.0</a>, which, unfortunately, does not look like it will be ready for prime time when it comes to polish and features.</p>



<p>Compared to the aforementioned games, New World is undoubtedly much more recent, having launched in September 2021. Some of you will even remember that it was quite popular at first, with Jeff Bezos <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applauding Amazon Game Studios for its first successful release</a>. That did not last due to a severe lack of content, which led players (myself included) to leave in droves.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New World:  Dev Update - October 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vvYpd_GKLI?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but the New World development team is slowly getting there, and the new season is very appealing. Nighthaven will introduce an eponymous new zone that, in a lengthy dev diary, was described as the game's largest and most vertical map, contrasting with previous additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-brimstone-sands-update-out-now-adds-a-new-zone-new-weapon-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brimstone Sands</a> (which was horizontal and barren). Visually, it is a love letter to classic horror with macabre, Eastern Europe-inspired aesthetics featuring towering castles, decrepit dungeons, and sweeping pine forests.</p>



<p>Not only does Nighthaven feature more points of interest, lore notes, and quests, it even adds some new interactive exploration and combat mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Chandeliers:</strong> Shoot them to drop on enemies (or risk them falling on you), reinforcing "look up."</li>



<li><strong>Throwables and Flammables:</strong> Use torches or fire staffs to burn spider webs and rat nests, expanding on systems from Cutlass Keys' lightning fields.</li>



<li><strong>Doors and Secrets: </strong>Various doors (bookcase, metal, wooden, magic-locked) lead to hidden areas.</li>



<li><strong>Arcana Tarot System: </strong>Collect 22 major Arcana cards (with Aeternum twists) to unlock tarot towers, elite chests, and caches. Combines with ancient glyphs for puzzles; encourages exploration via jump pads instead of guides.</li>



<li><strong>New Exploration Elements:</strong> Swim through mazes, dodge lasers, use water jets/elevators for vertical traversal.</li>



<li><strong>Jump Pads:</strong> Borrowed from the OPR (Outpost Rush) mode for open-world traversal in the region.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many horror-inspired creatures, from vampires to werewolves, bats, gargoyles, and even Frankenstein-inspired constructs, and a new story to follow, of course. But the most exciting additions to New World, at least for the long term, are arguably those that seek to expand the endgame.</p>



<p>First and foremost, there will be a new 10-man raid titled Isle of Night. This will be the new toughest PvE challenge in the game, featuring many new enemy types and three boss fights, each with unique mechanics to encourage group coordination. Amazon Game Studios is also adding a Catacombs mode where players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon with a countdown. Through a Catacombs run, they will obtain various power-ups and rewards and have to decide whether to keep going forward or exit before time runs out to retain the rewards. </p>



<p>Progression is getting a big shake-up as well. Level cap is increasing to 70, and the Gear Score is being raised from 725 to 800. Additionally, any Gear with Gear Score of 700 and more will be upgradeable all the way with the new Umbral system.</p>



<p>But there's more: gear can now have up to four empty sockets called Perk Charms, which are roughly split into four categories (offensive, defensive, skill, gems), allowing for greater build customization. Plus, the new gear from PvP, Catacombs, and the Isle of Night raid will feature set bonuses for the first time, making it even more important to get all the pieces in a set.</p>

<p>You need only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1o02qyg/is_new_world_back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go to the MMORPG subreddit</a> to see that there are a lot of positive vibes among MMO fans about Nighthaven (which will go live on October 13 on PC and consoles) and New World as a whole. Could it be the start of a big comeback for Amazon's game? Hopefully, but even greater is the hope that the studio will have learned its lesson ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming The Lord of the Rings MMO they are making</a>.</p>

            <p>Right, it's time to get ahead of the game. Approach your router and force it to repeat the things Lightning McQueen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaYn0541ro">says about speed</a> at the start of Cars, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has a launch patch coming and it sounds like it'll be weighty. EA say "over 200 changes" will be dropping as part of it and have also teased some potential future additions in their latest beta learnings post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">said community update post</a>, EA said these 200 launch day tweaks are "focused on bug fixes, balance improvements, and polish for release". As a result, movement should feel more responsive, while the recoil of automatic weapons will be rebalanced and various gadgets have been tweaked.</p>
<p>Also among the list of changes the publishers have revealed here ahead of deploying the full notes on release are layout revision for Rush and Breakthrough maps "for better balance between attackers and defenders". Some improvements to the game's netcode should also "reduce desync, make time-to-death feel fairer, and address cases of invisible damage". Personally, I don't feel the time-to-death'll truly be fair until a person can live their entire natural lifespan within a Siege of Cairo skirmish, but this'll do for now.</p>
<p>While EA have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">already announced the stuff they'll be adding over the next few months as part of the shooter's first season</a>, they did also cheekily tease the potential return of some other features down the line. "Requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more," they wrote.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>That's far from the only observation EA have made through 92 million-ish hours of beta testing. They plan to offer both single and mixed mode playlists, but note that "players favoured playlists with combined modes". They said that "there were no differences of note" in terms of time spent battling in open weapons playlists vs closed ones, but found that players tended to stick with the former once they'd tried both. "This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6," EA declared, but noted that closed playlists will still be on offer at launch.</p>
<p>So, Call of Duty-style freedom in terms of weapon choice for different classes getting more of the spotlight, rather than the more traditionally Battlefieldy emphasis on running with the specific gun type your class is aimed at excelling with. The publishers also add they didn't spot one particular weapon type becoming dominant in terms of pick rate, instead saying things were "well-distributed", which is promising for the variety of bullet you're shot by each match if accurate.</p>
<p>There we go. Now the final few days' wait for Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">full launch on October 10th</a> begin. If you can't stand five minutes without shootering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">ongoing beta</a> will <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">run until October 9th</a>. It's like the two are trying to form their own mixed playlist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has a bunch of enjoyable modes and is regularly adding more, some of which prove to be extremely popular. Delulu certainly falls into that category, and we’ve got the full schedule of the mode.</p>



<p>Delulu mode in Fortnite introduced proximity chat to the game, leading to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-proximity-chat-led-to-thousands-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands being banned</a> over the first weekend of the mode, but those who have behaved have been able to enjoy a unique approach to Fortnite that allows for mid-game alliances and betrayals.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when you can next dive into Delulu in Fortnite, take a peek at the full schedule. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-delulu-still-in-fortnite">Is Delulu Still in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, the Delulu mode is still available in Fortnite for a limited time, though the doors are not open 24/7.</strong></p>



<p>The mode was initially planned to be a limited-time mode, but has proven to be extremely popular and has been extended significantly. In fact, we know that the Delulu mode will be available until the end of 2025.</p>



<p>That is significant as Chapter 7 in Fortnite is due to kick-off in early December, so confirmation that the mode will be available for at least the first month after that huge update suggests Delulu could be a long-term addition.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-delulu-fortnite-schedule">Full Delulu Fortnite Schedule</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Delulu will be available every weekend until the end of 2025, starting at 6 AM PT on Friday and ending at 6 AM PT on Monday.</strong></p>



<p>Outside of these times, Delulu will not be available in Fortnite, so you’ll have to wait until the weekend calls to dive into the mode.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full Delulu schedule until the end of 2025.</p>

            <p>Physical copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> are in people's hands early, ahead of the official launch date of the 10th October. As such, it's been revealed the physical PS5 version of the game is entirely contained on the disk itself. No download required.</p>
<p>This was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">stated by Reddit User Grecea_Vlad</a>, who posted their early copy of Battlefield 6 online and answered a few questions from the community. They confirmed that no download was required to boot up Battlefield 6 days ahead of launch.</p>
<p>This makes Battlefield 6 a bit of an irregularity. Other large AAA games have required additional content downloads once a disc is inserted due to the hefty file size of these games. It's also so these games can load faster, as it's faster for a console to load files from its internal storage than from the inserted disc.</p>

<p>What this means for Battlefield 6 players who buy a physical version is you'll simply be able to slap in your physical copy and get straight to playing, which is a bit of a rarity these days.</p>
<p>Other info was revealed about the game courtesy of Grecea's early copy, including the online servers being up-and-running already. Apparently there are even a few people already online and playing, which is fun.</p>
<p>EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-battlefield-6-seasonal-content-plans-unveiled-first-batch-arrives-a-few-weeks-after-launch">recently revealed the post-launch content plan for Battlefield 6</a>, which will start coming to the game on the 28th October. New modes, new maps, weapons and more will be added to the game entirely for free.</p>

            <p>Bungie has announced a closed technical test for its forthcoming shooter Marathon, which will take place later this month.</p>
<p>The limited, invite-only test will be in North America and Europe across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, with players able to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">sign-up now</a>. The test itself will take place from 22nd - 27th October.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Marathon was fully revealed</a> back in April, but in June <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Bungie indefinitely delayed the extraction shooter</a> due to "passionate" fan feedback that was heavily critical.</p>

<p>Since then, Bungie has run several closed tests to gather further feedback. Now, it's opening the playtests further.</p>
<p>"This is an important checkpoint for us as we test our improvements since Alpha, including three maps, five runner shells, prox chat, re-tuned combat pacing, solo queue, deeper environmental storytelling, and more," said Bungie. "That said, the Technical Test build is a work in progress and will only include a portion of what’s planned for Marathon’s full release, focused on the early player experience."</p>
<p>A public update on Marathon's development is due "in the coming months", following this playtest.</p>
<p>The test is also under NDA, meaning feedback won't be made public.</p>

<p>Development of Marathon feels like a critical time for Bungie. Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquisition by Sony</a> back in 2022, Bungie has failed to release a hit game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> player counts have dropped, and the company has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">rocked by accusations of toxicity right up until this year</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie admitted after Marathon's reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">the game used an external artist's work without permission</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">morale was reportedly in "free fall"</a> as it dealt with the response to the game.</p>
<p>CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-following-years-of-criticism-layoffs-and-that-infamous-classic-car-collection">Pete Parsons has since left the company</a> after years of criticism and layoffs.</p>
<p>As for Sony, it's keen not to repeat mistakes made in the release of the ill-fated live-service shooter Concord, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-concord-developer-hits-back-at-criticism-of-bungies-marathon-reveal">Marathon has already been compared to</a>. Back in August, chief financial officer Lin Tao admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-concord-and-a-string-of-delays-and-cancellations-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">the company's live-service strategy is "not entirely going smoothly"</a>.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied in the hunt to boast full completion, with an extensive trophy list and achievements to hunt down.</p>



<p>The Bandai Namco title arrived to mark the start of a huge period for fans of the creature-catching genre, landing ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and there’s more than enough to digest—including mulling over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which Personality is best for each Digimon</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to tick off every task in the achievement and trophy list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, we’ve got the full to-do list for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-trophies-amp-achievements">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The trophy and achievement list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied, with rewards for story progression and completing specific tasks.</strong></p>



<p>Many of the achievements and trophies that are not hidden are unlocked through generic progression, which should be unlocked with ease by just playing through the game. However, there are tasks to train on the Digifarm a specific number of times and to spend YEN in shops.</p>



<p>A full list of the Digimon Story: Time Stranger trophies and achievements are below, with the hidden tasks separated later in this article.</p>

<p><strong>The majority of trophies and achievements in Digimon Story: Time Stranger are hidden, so consider this as your final story warning.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-digimon-story-time-stranger">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Digimon Story: Time Stranger?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 46 achievements and trophies to unlock in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, including the illustrious Platinum trophy for obtaining all other trophies.</strong></p>



<p>That task is still present for those on Xbox, though it awards zero Gamerscore and is merely the mark of a completionist. As usual, Xbox players have 1,000 total Gamerscore to hunt down.</p>



<p>Additional trophies and achievements could arrive in post-launch content, with the Season Pass offering plenty of DLC in the first year of the game.</p>

<p>Looking for a pick-me-up on a chilly morning (or afternoon, or whenever you happen to be reading this)? This five-minute arrangement of classic Koji Kondo tracks from the Mario series just might do the trick.</p>
<p>Recorded back on 23rd August, the WDR Funkhausorchester takes a delightfully brisk jog through some classic platforming tunes, spanning 1985's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> (yes, that is now retro, folks) by way of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">SMB3</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a>.</p>
<p>It's such a short and sweet arrangement that you may not want the included pieces spoiled. We'll put the timestamped titles at the bottom of the article, though - scroll down if you want 'em.</p>
<p>To those unfamiliar with this orchestra's oeuvre, the <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/orchester-und-chor/funkhausorchester/index.html">West German Broadcasting Cologne orchestra</a> has a broader focus beyond Classical...er, classics. So, in amongst your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0Ys6caA_o">Blue Danubes</a> and your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_i-CEoVQs">Paso Dobles</a>, they like to mix in some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mU41YusfQ">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkdCADxlYXs">Great Giana Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>And no, <em>Funkhausorchester</em> doesn't mean 'Funk House Orchestra'. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this cropped up on our feed and made us smile, so we thought we'd share. Let us know below if it gave a wee power-up on a Tuesday AM.</p>

			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps%E2%80%99-secret-28-minute-cutscene-bizarrely-mentions-game-of-thrones-naughty-dog-and-bagels.1318228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans of the recently released Baby Steps have been humoured by the surfacing of a nearly 30-minute cutscene in the game that’s only unlocked after ticking some major boxes. If you skip every cutscene in the game (which is no simple feat), you’ll unlock a secret cutscene that runs for a whopping 28 minutes, but it’s <strong>bizarre</strong>.</p>



<p>The secret Baby Steps cutscene is simply the game’s two lead actors (and developers), Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy, sitting outside a log cabin and chatting about their real lives, including Game of Thrones rewatches, bagel fillings, and Naughty Dog’s games.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-miss-uncharted-i-wish-they-d-bring-it-back">‘I Miss Uncharted, I Wish They’d Bring it Back’</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to YouTube, one creator uncovered the full, secret cutscene in Baby Steps, which comes in at a staggering 28 minutes and is seen by some as a ‘punishment’ for skipping every cutscene in the game.</p>



<p>That’s how you unlock the secret cutscene – you have to skip <strong>everything </strong>that comes before.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Baby steps - Secret cutscene found" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQahQACsvPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s a mildly motion-capped sequence that sees Nate (Gabe Cuzzillo) and Moose (Bennett Foddy) sitting outside a log cabin and chinwagging about life, pulling away from Baby Steps entirely, and gassing about all manner of things.</p>



<p>They test the limits of their motion capture equipment, rib the player for skipping cutscenes, and determine whether or not they should take a nap while being filmed.</p>



<p>At one point, they dive into the topic of Naughty Dog:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foddy: </strong>I miss Uncharted, I wish they’d bring it back.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>It has been a while.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I don’t think they’re going to do another new one.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That new one looks alright.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> Which one? The ‘space Uncharted’?</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>Yeah, that one looks good. I’m going to play that.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I’m not going to skip any of those cutscenes.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>You see how they put her jacket on, that’s insane!</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> People don’t know what’s involved in that.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That’s the most impressive thing I’ve seen in my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair go on to talk about putting broccoli in bagels, what else they had for lunch, and how Foddy’s Game of Thrones rewatch is going on, with Cuzzillo slipping in some casual spoilers for the viewers.</p>



<p>They even take a sidestep into talking about famous clowns, including Pennywise, The Joker, and Ronald McDonald.</p>



<p>As the segment unravels, the two actors discuss whether or not the player has skipped <strong>this </strong>cutscene before stressing that they need to use the bathroom and they can’t leave until things have played out to an undetermined end.</p>



<p>It ends with them ‘going to find the credits guy’ to get them rolling, suggesting that they’d ‘rough him up’ to bring in the end of the game. </p>



<p>This is probably one of the best secret cutscenes ever seen in a game, and it really humanized the actors quite nicely. Let me know if you already found this cutscene over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has unveiled a poster for this year’s iteration of The Haunting, the annual Halloween-themed event that hits the Call of Duty platform every October. This time around, players will come face-to-face with Predator.</p>



<p>The first news regarding this year’s The Haunting event was featured in a blog post published yesterday on the Call of Duty site. It was mentioned that The Haunting lands with the final season of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and that <strong>all</strong> studio partners have weighed in on the event in some capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-the-haunting-this-year">What’s Happening with The Haunting This Year?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty blog post</a> didn’t do much to clear up what’s coming in The Haunting 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Haunting will return with Season 06 of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and we (including all our studio partners) have some Halloween fun just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All we know is that The Haunting starts this week, on October 9th. It arrives as the Black Ops 7 beta comes to an end, marking the closure of a divisive, debate-laden trial period that has produced mixed feelings about this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post (and poster) that was uploaded to social media by Activision:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shortly after announcing The Haunting 2025 with the poster, the Call of Duty team responded ‘ok’ <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1975327267858293053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a post</a> from September 2023 requesting that Activision add a Predator skin to the game. It was a strange throwback, but perhaps it reveals how long the team has been considering this idea.</p>



<p>Last year’s The Haunting event ran between September and October and introduced Mike Myers, a character tied to the Call of Duty series, in a rather nostalgic way (IYKYK). Activision’s studios prepared spooky map variants, new modes including Zombie Royale and Hordepoint, and a fresh reward path for those participating in the event.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that The Haunting 2025 will be a similar affair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The announcement for PowerWash Simulator 2’s release date was slated to drop this week, but in an early trailer upload, the beans have been spilled. It has been three years since the first PowerWash Simulator game dropped, entertaining gamers everywhere and allowing them to clean everything from skateparks to carnival rides, and from trains to planes, with high-powered power washers.</p>



<p>The trailer has since been removed from YouTube, but not before eagle-eyed gamers were able to capture the release date for PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<p>In the leaked trailer (which no longer exists), <strong>it was revealed that PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming out on October 26</strong>.</p>



<p>Early impressions of PowerWash Simulator 2 have been positive, even if it’s understandably tough to improve upon such a simple concept. In PowerWash Simulator 2, you’re still cleaning things with power washers and utilizing an array of attachments and cleaning liquids, but previews have remarked on how ‘different’ it manages to feel.</p>



<p>The news regarding the leaked trailer was published on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nzlvtg/powerwash_simulator_2_release_date_trailer_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, with one user sharing the link to the now removed release date trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2. Using an archive platform simply reveals that the video now sits in a private state, ready to go live soon.</p>



<p>In the comments under the original post on Reddit, fans of the original PowerWash Simulator game were raving about how good it was. There are recollections of users pouring over 100 hours into the game, spraying endlessly, and cleaning dirt from surfaces in a game that’s pure relaxation and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed it an incoming Game of the Year contender, but that’s tongue-in-cheek at best.</p>

                <p>FromSoft's massively popular--and just plain massive in general--received a co-op spinoff called Elden Ring: Nightreign earlier this year. The game sees groups of 1-3 players teaming up to take on the titanic threats in the new realm of Limgrave. It's been a hit with fans and critics alike, but it's also a big departure from the gameplay of the original Elden Ring.

Players team up, choose a boss they want to fight, and then set off on an expedition that takes around 35- to 45-minutes to complete. This journey is split across three in-game days, as during the day your team will explore the land of Limveld--an alternate version of Elden Ring's Limgrave--and level up for the fight ahead of them.</p><p>Before your squad gets to the main boss, they'll have to take on smaller bosses as the map closes in on them, and on the third day, the grand showdown begins. This core gameplay loop has gone over well with fans, and it has been further polished with post-launch support since then.</p><p>"Elden Ring's DNA is ever-present, but Nightreign is also a game of striking subversions: a From Software game that asks you to play it unconventionally, disregarding meticulous exploration, isolation, and measured combat for a cooperative multiplayer game built on speed and aggression. In many ways, it's the antithesis of what people typically come to From Software games for, and yet somehow, someway, this experimental non-sequel is an absolute triumph," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/">Elden Ring: Nightrein review</a>.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you haven't played it yet, the original Elden Ring game is also on sale.

If you're planning to play on PS5, the PS4 deal is the best one here because Bandai Namco released a free upgrade for it a few years ago. This added an optional performance mode on PS5 that targets 60fps, increased graphical quality, ray tracing, and several other tweaks to Elden Ring's visuals. Elden Ring is considered to be one of From Software's greatest games, and is well worth picking up while it's discounted.</p><h2>Elden Ring Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576173"></a><figcaption>Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4576173-eldenringroadtoerdtree.jpg"></figure><p>For a different spin on Elden Ring, check out the official Elden Ring: The Road to the Erdtree manga.

While the genre is admittedly flooded with lackluster efforts--from Naruto to Demon Slayer--the Bleach game does break away from the pack by offering a fighting setup that's built around meaty and complex gameplay systems. The battle system is full of depth and intricate elements, and with stylish character animations, the end result is a slick fighting game that feels rewarding to play once you master it.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3MVFJC?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3NQZZP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a></li></ul></div>                      </div><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-anime-blu-rays-in-amazons-prime-big-deals-days-2025/1100-6535071/" data-ref-id="1100-6535071">Several other anime series are on sale during this Prime Big Deal Days sale</a>.

The RTX 5070 Ti is among the most powerful consumer GPUs available right now, and this OC Edition with 16GB GDDR7 should be more than capable of handling most games when played at high resolutions.

Essentially, this technology allows the CPU to retrieve data faster than expected, as it boasts an impressive 96 MB L3 cache (which is extremely noticeable while gaming). It's built on the 5nm Zen 4 architecture, and it's powerful enough for both gaming and work applications like photo editing or intense coding.</span></p><p>The 8-Core, 16-Thread processor is great at multitasking, so you shouldn't have any issues if you decide to stream a TV show or launch into Chrome while waiting for the next round of Counter-Strike. The 7800X3D is widely regarded as one of the best gaming processors on the market, and it's a hard bargain now that it's under $350.</p></div>                      </div><p>While we're big fans of the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, it's not the only CPU discounted for Prime Big Deal Days. Both AMD and Intel components are on sale--so be sure to shop around to find the best fit for your gaming setup. However, most will likely find the 7800X3D to be the best fit. If you don't mind stretching your budget, you can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFKC99VL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Intel Core Ultra 9 Unlocked (24-Core, 24 Thread)</a> for $499 (was $599). Keep in mind that it's not designed for gaming, but folks running intensive video editing applications will find it to be a nice choice.</p><p>While the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Processor is quite budget-friendly with this new discount, there are plenty of cheaper options. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VCJ171S?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 5 5500 (6-Core, 12-Thread)</a> is down to $61 (was $159), the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBJ59WJ4?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12-Core, 24-Thread)</a> is $285 (was $549), and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">Intel Core i7-12700K (12-Core, 20 Thread)</a> is $185 (was $510). All three are reasonable choices for gaming, making them worthy alternatives if you're looking to save a few bucks.

<p>The rumours about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> getting ported to Nintendo's Switch successor have been doing the rounds on the internet for some time now.</p>
<p>In an update on this, podcaster and YouTuber 'NateTheHate' has responded to a recent comment <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1974887737678553101">on social media</a>, claiming the Switch 2 version does indeed "exist" (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/they-exist-red-dead-redemption-2s-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-2-versions-are-still-happening-its-claimed/">thanks for the heads up, VGC</a>). As for the timing of the release, he's got no news to share at this stage.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b546e6866da9a"><a title="Red Dead Redemption 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b546e6866da9a/red-dead-redemption-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / via X</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-pretty-soon">a rumour in May</a>, which reported "sources close to Rockstar Games" had indicated that the second entry starring Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde Gang would be released on the Switch 2 within the current fiscal year - so, <em>before</em> the end of March 2026.</p>
<p>Rockstar is already gearing up for a huge 2026 after it announced the delay of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/grand-theft-auto-6-has-been-delayed-and-will-now-launch-in-may-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> earlier this year. This anticipated release will now launch for Xbox and PlayStation platforms next year on 26th May.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> game was ported to the Switch in 2023. You can check out our review here on Nintendo Life for more information.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are now available</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're still on the hunt for certain Switch 2 accessories and are looking for alternatives to Nintendo's products, there are plenty of third-party offerings already popping up. Accessory maker Turtle Beach recently released a headset, and it has now announced multiple other products.</p>
<p>This includes a new range of wired and wireless controllers, cases, and screen protectors. There's the Rematch, Afterglow Wave and Afterglow controllers, as well as a PlayTrek 2-in-1 Case and cases for the standalone system.</p>
<p>Controllers start at $29.99 / £24.99 wired, and will set you back $64.99 / £54.99 for a wireless one. Apart from different models (including features like Hall-Effect thumbsticks, RGB, and a GameChat button), there are also different designs available. The two-in-one PlayTrek carry case costs $49.99 / £39.99 and travel cases are priced between $19.99 / £14.99 - $29.99 / £19.99.</p>


<p>All of these are officially licensed products and pre-orders for these products are NOW <a href="https://www.turtlebeach.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2">live on the Turtle Beach website</a>. We also reviewed the company's Switch 2 headset not long ago, and thought it was a great budget accessory. Here's a quick summary, in case you missed it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judged purely on its sound quality and features, this is a very solid headset that gets done what's needed. Throw in the better-than-expected design, and that budget-price point and, for folks looking a bargain buy, the Airlite Fit for Switch 2 creep up into highly recommended territory."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

Walmart's week-long sales event ends October 12. But since Amazon matches competitor prices so often, Big Deal Days will still be going strong days after it technically ends.</p><p>Walmart's sale pages aren't always the easiest to navigate, and it's not uncommon for products that aren't even discounted to be front and center on Walmart's site. With that in mind, we poked around and put together a list of links that lead to some of the best deals we've spotted so far. It's essentially a Walmart Deals navigation system for GameSpot readers, based on what we see readers most interested in during big sales like this one.</p><p>We've also included a short list of our favorite gaming, tech, and toy deals. We'll add to this list throughout the week as deals sell out, so check back for new recommendations in the coming days.</p><h2><a

<p>There'll be no music updates next week</p>

<figure data-uuid="db765c62789c9"><a title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db765c62789c9/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fan favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> made its grand return last May, and in an update to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app today, the game's soundtrack has <em>finally</em> been added.</p>
<p>This includes not only the <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/d87d523c-cb7c-4412-aafd-fa668b65defd">Switch version</a> of the soundtrack but also the original <a href="https://share.music.nintendo.com/en-US/US/officialPlaylists/1b466e17-95ee-4c62-9b97-14b4d7152cd8">GameCube album</a>. The Switch album is apparently loaded with a whopping 275 tracks, and there are 111 songs for the classic GameCube release.</p>
<p>Before you begin your jam session, just so you know - Nintendo won't be releasing any new tracks on the service next week. It didn't provide a specific reason for this, but there's a national holiday in Japan next week. It skipped weekly updates previously, which have also lined up with public holidays.</p>

<p>If you didn't play Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door back in the day, or haven't tried out the Switch version just yet, be sure to check out our review here on Nintendo Life. We said it was still the king of Mario's RPG outings. Here's our summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For 20 years, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the best Mario RPG of all time, and the Switch remake proves it has earned that title. This is a fantastic RPG adventure, whether you’re a Mario fan or not, with some best-in-class combat, brilliant writing, and a few little creases ironed out to make this the definitive way to play Thousand-Year Door."</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance-which-version-should-you-buy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-switch-1-vs-switch-2-performance%E2%80%94which-version-should-you-buy.1318147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Switch 2 gives a smoother experience. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>

<p>Which version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A are you going to buy? Let us know in the comments or the Insider Gaming forum.</p>



<p>Did you know some mega evolutions in Pokémon Legends: Z-A are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-locks-some-mega-evolutions-behind-online-ranked-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">locked behind online battles</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film/Mori Calliope/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>In anime, an opening theme isn’t just a vibe—it’s a thesis statement. Before a single line of dialogue hits viewers' ears, that song sets a tone, teases an emotional arc, and lets fans know whether a show is gonna punch them in the gut or kick their heart in its ass. Basically, a good OP is a part of an anime’s holy trinity: art style, voice cast, and theme song. When it slaps, you don’t skip it; you sing along with it week in and week out.&nbsp;</p><p>So when <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a>, the trashpunk shonen anime from Bones Film (of <em>My Hero Academia</em> fame), needed a new theme to match its explosive second cour, it wasn’t just about finding any fairweather musician to do the job. It needed someone who <em>gets it</em>. Someone who’s lived and breathed anime and knows what makes it work. Enter <a href="https://rollingstonejapan.com/articles/detail/38289/4/1/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mori Calliope</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | MAIN TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeRvDchyo44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mori Calliope isn’t just a megapopular VTuber with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_qhgtOy0dy1Agp8vkySQg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2 million subscribers</a> and a discography that goes hard—she’s also a diehard <em>Gachiakuta</em> manga fan who’s lowkey been fiending for this kind of opportunity. She’s a part of the crowd who liked it before its anime adaptation made it mainstream. Her upcoming <em>Gachiakuta </em>theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” aims to be a sonic embodiment of <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s volatile rage and righteous fury, mirroring Rudo’s descent into The Pit and his fight to reclaim justice.</p><p>In our chat, Mori Calliope broke down how “Let’s Just Crash” channels Rudo’s ongoing journey as the anime’s hero, how VTubbing let her cross the line from fan to creator, and how she hopes this collab will be the first of many to come as anime and VTubbing jointly become core tenets of pop culture.&nbsp;</p><h2>A VTuber manga reader fan’s dream come true</h2><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">！？！？！？so happy！！！！</p>— 裏那圭◾️KEI URANA (@KEI_URANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/KEI_URANA/status/1941380304159244710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> How did you first get involved with singing <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour theme—was it something you were approached to do, or was it something you wished to pursue as a fan of either Studio Bones' anime adaptation or Kei Urana’s ongoing manga?</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Mori Calliope:</strong> Honestly, it was a combination of both. I’ve been a fan of <em>Gachiakuta </em>since 2022. It was always in my heart—<a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1880242188539527568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being such a big fan of the manga</a>—that I thought to myself, “I’d really love to sing the opening for this manga whenever it becomes an anime.” I didn’t know if I could do it, though, or if I was the right choice or experienced enough, but sure enough, the offer came to me from my label. My producer wanted to meet with me to give me the good news, and that’s how I knew it was really good news.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn’t feel real at first when I got the offer, but as I started making the song, it became a lot more real very quickly. It’s been a crazy emotional time, but I’m really happy to have been given the opportunity as a huge fan of the manga. I’d even say it’s <a href="https://x.com/moricalliope/status/1796936112876974332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my favorite manga ever</a>, so I’m just really happy to be here.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="BEHIND GACHIAKUTA | Creators Interview &amp; Behind-the-scenes" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQQF81ubINM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What about <em>Gachiakuta </em>drew you to liking it enough to want to make a theme song for it? Was there something about its world, tone, art style, or characters that immediately clicked with you and your musical style?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Honestly, I feel like the first thing that drew me into wanting to read more of the manga was definitely Urana's art style, because there's just this amazing combination of Western and Eastern sensibilities within the art. I'm a really big fan of Western cartoons. I know that Urana is also a fan of Western cartoons, and even back in the day when I used to draw, I'd combine those art styles together and always think, “I wish I could be better at this.” Seeing Urana’s art, I felt this is the exact style that I’ve longed to see in any piece of media and I just love it so much.&nbsp;</p><p>I also love the way Urana writes characters as well and their relationships with each other. Everybody’s got their own story going on, but they all intersect in a really beautiful way. And this overarching theme of becoming more and more human together in a dark and desolate world… I just love it so much. I think Urana’s a fantastic storyteller.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta Opening | &quot;HUGs&quot; by Paledusk" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9f89PWhv8YE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s first cour opening, “Hugs” by metalcore band Paledusk, as well as its original soundtrack, saw the anime lean heavily into rap and heavy metal genres—things you’ve also embraced over the years with your own original songs. Having listened to your theme song, “Let’s Just Crash,” I wanted to ask if there was a particular character, arc, or emotional beat in the lead-up to <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s second cour that served as the emotional anchor for the song’s lyrics, tone, and title?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I was informed that this cour—without giving too much away—you can already tell from the PV that there’s a lot of battles going on. Because I was informed about that, I knew I had to make something that was very dynamic and impactful as much as possible. So I tried to lean a little bit more into the anisong feeling—rock rap with a little bit of metal in there as well. Just a touch of it, it’s more rock than anything, I think.</p><p>But in particular, I really wanted to channel Rudo’s rage. It’s one of the main things that got me into the comic and kept me reading—wanting to learn more about his story and seeing the results of his anger come to a head over time through his character development. At the beginning of the song, you may hear an iconic line from Rudo, except I’m the one screaming it. I hope fans will look forward to that for sure, because I wanted to write most of it from Rudo's perspective. But the song also includes a lot of hopefulness, as well as what I feel he has gotten from befriending the Cleaners. I hope that it will be a fitting second cour opening.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Kei Urana/Hideyoshi Andou/Kodansha</span></figcaption></figure><div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Was there any particular moment in production, whether it's a lyric or a riff, where you geeked out over singing?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>A lot of lyrics within the song draw from specific moments within the manga, and now the anime as well. I didn’t write all of them. I only wrote the English lyrics, but especially in the intro, I want fans to listen to that. There are some parts that I rap in the first verse that I think are very indicative of what Rudo’s inner monologue might be, so I want people to focus on those parts, as well as the screams that I do in the chorus that have this big ensemble feeling for this ensemble show.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did you read ahead in the manga or preview episodes from the second cour to get in the headspace of writing the lyrics for the song, or were you only given a concept of where the story was going to go emotionally to have to match that sonically?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>By the time I got the offer, I was already caught up with <em>Gachiakuta</em>. Up until the actual production of the song, I just kept rereading it (maybe out of excitement as well). I was really hype about that. But of course, we also got requests from the production side as well. We had a formal meeting where I got to meet everybody working on the anime and hear their requests for what they wanted the song to sound like, including Urana’s request. I combined those with my own ideas and sensibilities about what I wanted the song to sound like.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="[MV] Wanted, Wasted - Mori Calliope x Takuya Yamanaka (THE ORAL CIGARETTES)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEHbF1PsLI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What was Urana’s specific request for what this cour theme would sound like?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> She specifically wanted something intense.&nbsp; Of course, rock is a huge part of the world of <em>Gachiakuta</em>, but she also wanted me to do a lot of shouts and yells as well.<strong> </strong>Interestingly enough, there was a song that I wrote a couple of years ago that I very openly said was inspired&nbsp; by <em>Gachiakuta</em>. She referenced that song of mine. It’s called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXwCOIwQZ18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanted Wasted</a>.” I wrote the lyrics in English for that song and created that song with <em>Gachiakuta </em>in mind. So she brought up that song and said she’d like it to sound like that as well my song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbNF8FqzIMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cult Following</a>” from my <a href="https://lnk.to/mc_PHANTOMIME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantomine </a>album.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a VTuber whose persona and aesthetic are deeply rooted in anime, what does it mean to you to have your voice officially tied to a series like <em>Gachiakuta </em>that’s being heralded as the next big shonen series?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> It’s honestly a complete and total dream come true for me. Even now, it doesn’t totally feel real. I’m honored that Urana is a fan of mine, as I am also a huge fan of hers. That’s kind of how our friendship was born—from just being fans of each other. I feel happy and also lucky. The stars really aligned on this one. That’s why the production of the song was very difficult for me, because I wanted to make the song as good as possible because it means so much to me.&nbsp;</p><p>I think from here on out, even if I do receive offers for other songs, this was really my true end goal: to make an opening or a song for something that I love so much. So I’m just extremely happy about it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">wwww ナイス帽子ぺこ！！！</p>— Mori Calliope💀holoEN (@moricalliope) <a href="https://twitter.com/moricalliope/status/1949491897040601191?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> You recently had a solo concert that you performed earlier this year. Is there ever a feedback loop between being a VTuber and a musician?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> In this industry, there are people who focus on one, the other, or both. There are certainly folks that want music to be their main image, but I think it’s a difficult path to walk because you need to focus mostly on originals and maybe some covers, and streaming should be supplemental to your musical activities. Then there are folks that want to focus mostly on streaming, being a personality. They might make some character songs, but that’s about it.&nbsp;</p><p>From where I’m standing, I have always been a musician. I was a musician before beginning this career, and I’ve always wanted it to be central to my image. But I love streaming so much that I feel like streaming has also become very essential to who I am. So I’m a bit of a hybrid, I guess.</p><p>My hope is that from here on out, as a virtual artist, more virtual artists might be able to get these kinds of opportunities, because a lot of us are taking music very seriously and are working very hard to create music as our main activities. I’m looking forward to seeing what else could come from this opportunity that I’ve gotten here for the world of VTubers, virtual artists, virtual singers, etc.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>&nbsp;Beforehand, anime was a niche thing no one really talked about, but it’s become a big thing everyone’s talking about. Likewise, VTubing evolved from being a subgenre of live streaming to becoming more commonplace. Do you see this kind of crossover, where VTubers contribute to an anime’s sonic identity, as part of a larger shift in how mainstream streaming culture and traditional pop culture media are blending together?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I feel like, as you said, [VTubing has] always been very separate. But now, because anime is becoming more mainstream, you see it happening especially from big shonen getting even bigger overseas—for example, all the people that love <em>Gachiakuta </em>as well would be a testament to that. Because VTubing is intrinsically tied to anime, I feel it’s a natural result of anime becoming more mainstream overseas and globally. Because of that, I feel that VTubing is also moving in that direction, and [especially] streaming on platforms like Twitch or YouTube, [which] are integrating our existence more into the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m very much focused on the anime sphere of things. Anime and games are where I’m based and where I like to be. But I think that from here on out, more YouTubers that have an interest in hitting the mainstream will probably be able to branch out there for sure. We’ll see more of that happening in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | Official Cour 2 Trailer | Crunchyroll" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wId1ejSTvcA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>You can hear a snippet of Mori Calliope's "Let's Just Crash" here.</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>IC:</strong> What do you hope fans feel in their souls whenever they hear your theme song for <em>Gachiakuta</em>, both as a VTuber artist, musician, and anime fan?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I want people to remember this song in a similar way that I remember anime openings from my childhood. There are gonna be people out there who are kids that will—hopefully—remember this song as they grow older in the same way that I have with my past favorite OPs. If they could feel, as the song says in Japanese, “hope in the gutter,” then I would be extremely happy if this song could give people an outlet for their tumultuous feelings inside but still finding hope within the dirtiness and darkness of the world. That would make me extremely happy.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>fans can look forward to hearing Mori Calliope’s opening theme, “Let’s Just Crash,” in the anime’s second cour, which debuts on October 12 on Crunchyroll.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="30d0aa4f33500"><a title="Mina The Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30d0aa4f33500/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games' new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> was on track for a 31st October 2025 release, but it seems the plans have now changed.</p>
<p>In an official statement on the company's website, the "delay extravanganza" continues – with the team behind this new retro <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">Zelda</a>-inspired adventure having to make the "tough decision" to delay the title on Switch, Switch 2, and all other platforms, as "it's just not quite there yet". Fortunately, this delay isn't a major one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="W9fsZhwHLmM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9fsZhwHLmM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5efcbekmnhtx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>With that said, we would like to apologize! Nevertheless, we will not waver on our commitment to quality. Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That’s no hollow promise!</p>
<p>We don’t want to announce another release date until it’s submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line.</p>
<p>The game is <em>so</em> close to being done- we’re playing it from start to finish every day. In the final hours, this is what the crew is working on:</p>
<p>- Finalizing design, art, and sound<br>
- Overall game balancing<br>
- Implementing localization<br>
- Eating cheese<br>
- Testing, testing, testing… on all platforms!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there's no new release date just yet, but again, it sounds like fans won't have to wait too long, as it's adding the final polish to select areas to make the game "truly shine". The original launch date was previously revealed in August of this year, and alongside it was the launch of a free demo, which will even carry over save data to the final build.</p>
<p>Over the past month, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> have also been delayed.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-govee-smart-lamp-stock-now-selling-for-less-than-a-basic-floor-lamp-2000632160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-govee-smart-lamp-stock-now-selling-for-less-than-a-basic-floor-lamp.1318102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your living room deserves smart lighting that doesn’t drain your wallet. Smart floor lamps have become incredibly popular for transforming spaces with dynamic colors and voice control but the price tags often make people think twice. Not anymore. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Govee RGBIC floor lamp has dropped to just $59 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. This Prime Big Deal Days offer <strong>marks an all-time low</strong> for one of the most popular smart lamps on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is not another mood-decorating, color-changing lamp: The Govee floor lamp is 136cm high and<strong> produces 1000 lumens of light which means it genuinely functions as actual light for your room</strong> (rather than mood decoration). At that level of brightness, it places it on a par with standard floor lamps so you can employ it for reading, working or ambient room light when it’s day, then shift over to bright color modes when night falls.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Smart Lamp Worth Your Money</h2>
<p>The RGBIC tech (that IC means <em>Independent Control</em>) distinguishes this lamp from less expensive ones: <strong>Each of the light strip segments is capable of showing disparate colors at the same time</strong>&nbsp;which lets you have flowing rainbow effects or gradients or multi-color schemes that plain RGB lamps aren’t up for. At your fingertips, <strong>you’re looking at 16 million different available colors and 58 dynamic built-in scenes</strong> named Cheerful, Romantic, and the like. Want your lamp pulsing red and orange, like a campfire? Done. Want a chilly blue-to-purple gradient for a late gaming marathon? Easy. The range goes deep enough that you’ll be able to fine-tune your lamp with holiday decorations or a party theme or just your mood of the moment without ever using the same look twice.</p>



<p>Voice command with Alexa or Google Home allows you never to have to rummage for your phone. Simply ask your smart speaker to turn the lamp on, change the hue, or reduce the brightness while cooking, working, or already settled on the sofa. The Govee Home app (installable through QR code on the box) adds additional control features with scheduling, so your lamp automatically wakes you gently with morning hues or unwinds with warm hues at bedtime. The app interface makes it simple to create custom scenes, allowing you to set specific hues for varying segments of a scene and then save your favorite sets for instant recall.</p>
<p>With sync mode,<strong> this light springs to life at parties, movie nights, or when playing video games</strong>. Inner microphones detect sound in the room and translate it into dynamic, real-time changes in brightness. Thump-heavy tunes create pulsing results, dialogues stay gentle, and action scenes erupt with corresponding changes in color. This dynamic lighting delivers real immersion for entertainment without cluttered setup.</p>
<p>The physical build makes this lamp suitable for real homes: Aluminum construction makes it firm (non-wobbling, non-tipping) yet light enough for simple transport from one room to another. Sections on the base fasten immediately without tools. At 136cm tall, it comfortably inhabits a corner, behind a sofa or next to a desk without overwhelming your space.</p>
<p>Stock sells out fast on Prime Big Deal Days, so this all-time-low pricing won’t last indefinitely.</p>

Today, the Court denied the company’s request for a partial stay, meaning the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">permanent injunction is still in effect</a>, meaning Google must do the following things <em>this month</em> or be in violation:</p><div><ul><li><span>Stop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</span></li><li><span>Let developers set their own prices</span></li><li><span>Stop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation</span></li><li><span>Work with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores into Google Play</span></li></ul></div><p>Epic Games says the deadline for Google to comply is now October 22nd, 2025. “Starting October 22, developers will be legally entitled to steer US Google Play users to out-of-app payments without fees, scare screens, and friction - same as Apple App Store users in the US!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1975309212336238829">writes Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>.</p><p>Google wouldn’t explicitly tell <em>The Verge</em> if the company now plans to remove the requirement for Google Play Billing, allow other payment methods, and allow developers to link outside the Play Store to app downloads, among other things, at the same time it’s still trying to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.</p><p>But spokesperson Dan Jackson tells <em>The Verge</em> that the company will comply with its legal obligations, and passed along the following statement:</p><p>“Android provides more choice for users and developers than any mobile OS, and the changes ordered by the US District Court will jeopardize users’ ability to safely download apps. While we’re disappointed the order isn’t stayed, we will continue our appeal.”</p><p>Epic did not immediately answer our questions about whether it’s now working with Google on the court-mandated Joint Technical Committee to figure out how to bring Google Play apps to rival app stores without jeopardizing that safety.</p><p>Google has said it will fully appeal to the Supreme Court for certiorari by October 27th, 2025 — but that would be after the deadline. The district court judge who originally issued the injunction, Judge James Donato, previously asked Google and Epic to explain how they’ll comply with it in his courtroom on October 30th.</p><p>It’s still possible that the Supreme Court might take up the case after Google’s deadline has passed.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/793610/google-epic-android-supreme-court-stay-denied]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The 22,000 Pa Roborock With Mop Delivers Luxury Cleaning Power, Now at Its Lowest Price for Prime Members.]]></title>

              <p>Roborock launched the Saros 10R in June 2025 and introduced its latest flagship generation that redefines what premium robot vacuums can achieve. This is <strong>the most advanced model in Roborock’s entire lineup</strong>, and it delivers power and capabilities that dwarf every other robot vacuum currently sold on Amazon.</p>
<p>Now, for Prime Big Deal Days, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/">technological marvel has dropped to a new record low of $1,199, down from its usual $1,599</a>. The reason people invest in premium robot vacuums like this is simple: they want their <strong>floors genuinely clean</strong> without lifting a finger, and cheaper models simply can’t deliver the thoroughness, intelligence, or convenience that justify the automation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22,000 Pa Suction Power Eradicates Dirt on Entire Surfaces</h2>
<p>Conventional robot vacuums are 3.8 to 4 inches high due to the necessity for a raised LDS (<em>Laser Distance Sensor</em>) tower on top for mapping. Roborock Saros 10R features the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 which eliminates the extending sensor unit and <strong>reduces the profile to a mere 3.14 inches high</strong>. The vacuum slides under beds, sofas, cabinets and coffee tables that stand in the way of chunkier rivals.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing capabilities accurately map rooms even under spindly-legged furniture and drop-down cabinets with the VertiBeam Lateral Obstacle Avoidance system avoiding obstructions such as cables and poly-legged furniture legs without getting stuck. The advanced algorithms identify and respond to 108 different types of obstructions, so the vacuum cleans your whole home without incessant supervision or rescue interventions.</p>



<p>The <strong>HyperForce suction system produces 22,000 pascals of vacuum pressure</strong> which is about double/triple what mid-range robot vacuums deliver. This brute strength removes ground-in dirt from carpet fibers, draws out debris from grout gaps between tiles, and sucks up fine dust particles from hardwood left behind by weaker robots. The Zero-Tangling DuoDivide main brush features a <strong>dual-sided design that keeps hair from tangling around the roller</strong>, automatically ejecting and depositing long hair and pet fur directly into the dustbin. The FlexiArm Riser side brush <strong>extends automatically when it senses corners and edging</strong>, sweeping out debris from baseboards and cramped corners that round robots almost universally ignore.</p>



<p>The first-of-its-type AdaptiLift Chassis adjusts the height of the robot dynamically, navigating through obstructions up to 4 cm high like door thresholds, area rug corners, and U-shaped chair leg furnishings that would cause lighter robots to stall. As soon as it senses carpet, <strong>the two rotating cleaning mops and their mounting bracket automatically lift up</strong> so you don’t wet your carpets, then lower when returning to hard floors.</p>
<p>The multifunctional dock 4.0 handles ten different maintenance tasks autonomously: It washes mops with 176-degree Fahrenheit hot water, dries them with 131-degree hot air to prevent mildew, <strong>empties the robot’s dustbin automatically with 60 days of capacity</strong>, refills the water tank, dispenses cleaning solution, and even cleans itself with hot water. The dock recharges the robot in 2.5 hours, and when it detects heavily soiled areas during cleaning, it triggers automatic re-wash and re-mop cycles for deep cleaning.</p>
<p>At $1,199 during Prime Big Deal Days, the Saros 10R costs less than several mid-range variants but delivers flagship performance for which full automation is justified.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Power Station (1500W, 7 Outlets) Is Going for Pennies, as Amazon Drops the Price for a Second Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-power-station-1500w-7-outlets-is-going-for-pennies-as-amazon-drops-the-price-for-a-second-time-2000632145</link>

              <p>This weekend, Amazon dropped the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2)</strong> to $429 for early <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> access. Now the retailer has taken things even further by lowering the displayed price to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">plus an additional 10% off at checkout for eligible buyers, bringing the final cost down to potentially $359 (down from $799)</a>. This is an absolute record low price for this power station, and here’s what makes it remarkable: <strong>no competitor offering a 1500W portable power station has ever come close to this pricing</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’re<strong> looking at half off the usual $799 retail price</strong> on a product that solves one of the most frustrating problems for campers, RV owners and anyone preparing for emergencies. Running out of power during outdoor adventures or losing electricity during storms creates genuine hardship, and the Jackery Explorer 1000 provides enough capacity and output to keep essential devices running for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Days of Power, Not Hours</h2>
<p>The 1070 watt-hour capacity provides robust energy storage translating to real-world usage most users are familiar with. You’ll be able to <strong>charge a laptop around 10 times, run a mini-fridge for approximately 15 hours</strong>, support LED lights for a few days or run a CPAP unit for a number of evenings. The LiFePO4 battery chemistry is a step up from lithium-ion batteries employed for lower-end power stations: LiFePO4 batteries last for approximately 4,000 charge cycles until capacity dips at 80%, for reference, standard lithium-ion batteries last for around 500 to 1,000 cycles at the 80% level.</p>
<p>The majority of portable power stations have a peak output of between 300W and 500W which makes for charging small devices like cell phones or a mini portable fan at once. The <strong>1500W of continuous output with a 3000W surge delivers</strong> sufficient power for actual household devices like microwaves, electric kettles, power tools, or a small air conditioner unit. The surge amount addresses the starting burst of power when starting motors which is relevant for devices like refrigerators that consume several multiples of their-rated wattage for a number of seconds at starting time. The unit contains <strong>everyday AC outlets</strong> which accept typical three-prong plugs, and a<strong> 100W USB-C Power Delivery outlet</strong> for quick charging a laptop or tablet without bulky AC adapters.</p>



<p>The fast charging for one hour <strong>allows you to go from zero to full battery in 60 minutes</strong> via a common wall outlet which is extremely fast for a battery of this size. Most rival power stations need 6-8 hours for a full recharge. This quick turnaround is priceless on multi-day camping trips when you may have shore power available for a few hours here or there, or when there are rolling blackouts when you have a quick top-off between outages. The unit also has solar charging capabilities with optional solar panels, allowing you to have power on tap indefinitely off-grid when you harness energy from the sun during the day.</p>
<p>The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 currently the <strong>highest-rated best-seller on Amazon for generators for outdoors</strong>, with over 4,000 units sold this month alone and a 4.6-star overall rating out of nearly 3,000 reviews. At $359 using the checkout discount on Prime Big Deal Days, you pay less than some 500Wh power centers with half the capacity and a much lower lifespan.</p>
