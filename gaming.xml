                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has reacted to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> announcement, saying the company wants to support the console and that Nintendo's announcement of the system doesn't make Microsoft nervous about its own next-gen plans.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Spencer said Microsoft has already supported the original Switch through titles like Minecraft, Pentiment, and Grounded. And looking ahead, Spencer said, "I want to support Switch 2."</p><p>"Nintendo has been a great partner. We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren't PC players, who aren't players on Xbox. It lets us continue to grow our community of people that care about the franchises that we have, and that's really important for us to make sure we continue to invest in our games," he said.</p><p>Spencer added: "I'm really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1095777500" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

indicated that Xbox games are coming to Switch 2.</a> One likely candidate, just to start with, would be Minecraft, given that game's size and scale.</p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer was asked if Nintendo unveiling the Switch 2 makes Microsoft "antsy to announce" plans for the next Xbox. Spencer replied, "No."</p><p>"I think all of us in this industry should focus on our communities and the player base that we're building. I get inspired by what a lot of different creators do and other platform holders. But I believe in the plans that we have," he said. "Obviously, we're evolving what it means to be Xbox and meeting players in so many different places. There are 3 billion people who play video games on the planet and I get up every morning and think about how Xbox can be more relevant to the 3 billion people who play."</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5. As for Microsoft's plans for the future, the company is reportedly planning to launch a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">new Xbox console and a handheld device.</a> There is no word yet, however, on when a new Xbox might be released.</p>

			<p>The stunning NVIDIA Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo shown last month is now available for download, giving users the chance to experience neural rendering, which NVIDIA itself described as the future of graphics.</p>
<p>The new demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/zorah/ZorahSample_UE5_Source_1.0.0.7z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is powered by the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine 5 branch and features plenty of cutting-edge tech, so performance is likely to be unstable on the vast majority of system configurations. Still, it provides an early look at how next-generation games will look with enhanced real-time path tracing and every other improvement offered by Neural Rendering.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah | Neural Rendering, Powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtTtUyqGs-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX Neural Rendering support in DirectX was announced last month during<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/"> GDC 2025</a>, when NVIDIA also provided an overview of how Neural Rendering can be used, such as RTX Neural Texture Compression, which can create a neural representation of thousands of textures in a very short time, saving up to seven times the VRAM and RAM compared to regular compression tech, and RTX Neural Radiance Cache, which can infer theoretically infinite multi-bounce indirect lighting from just one or two bounces to optimize performance and visuals.</p>
<p>More information on the RTX Neural Rendering features found in the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo can be found on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">NVIDIA's official website.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skull and Bones: Year 2 Update Announcements Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The teaser shown off as part of the Skull and Bones Year 2 Showcase shows early gameplay with pirates dual-wielding blades and firearms. It looks like players will have the option of getting up close and personal or picking enemies off from a distance, depending on their choice of weapon.</p><p>The new combat style is set to be integrated in Year 2's third season as part of a larger content update adding officers to player ships. In order to recruit said officers, players will have to undertake the land-based missions to rescue officers being held in captivity by the Rogue Warlord.</p><p>From what was shown off in the showcase, the land combat appears to be purely PvE, and takes place entirely on land--meaning boarding enemy ships and on-deck combat is unlikely to arrive with this combat update, despite also being highly requested by players.</p><p>Skull and Bones Year 2 Season 1 has already kicked off, bringing with it item ascension, world tiers, new developments in the world's story, and more new features. Players will have to wait until later in the year for the debut of land combat in Season 3.</p>

                <p> The next Battlefield game doesn't even have an official name yet, but fans are already hands-on with an early build thanks to the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs playtest program</a>. That program has proved a headache for devs, with participants leaking footage in spite of NDAs, and starting rumors about the use of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM).</p><p>A rumor that Battlefield 6 would use SBMM, which likely originated from the playtest, has spread through the Battlefield community, with fans up in arms about its potential inclusion. Battlefield's lead producer David Sirland attempted to clarify the use of SBMM with playtesters, in a post that was later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared to Reddit</a>. </p><p>"Just for clarity--saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is 'Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad,'" Sirland said in the post. "But that doesn't make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams--no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn't be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?"</p><p>Sirland added that Battlefield 2042 also would be considered to have SBMM by this definition, and attempted to calm down the conversation by assuring fans that any SBMM used in Battlefield 6 would be applied with a light touch. The response to Sirland's comments being shared to Reddit only reignited the discussion, prompting Battlefield's global community manager T0TALfps to step in. </p><p>"Okay enough," T0TALfps's comment started, trying to put an end to the ongoing discourse. The community manager reminded players that the build that part of the BF Labs playtest is far from a finished game, and there is no guarantee that any feature in it will make it to the finish line in the same form. T0TALfps continued to tell off leakers who ignored NDAs to spread details about the early playtests.</p><p>"There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it," they said. "We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to."</p><p>It will likely be a while until we get more official details on the next Battlefield game--including its official title. According to a recent EA financial report, the company expects the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">release before March 2026</a>. Interested players can still sign up for the <a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs playtest</a> program in the meantime.</p>

            <p>Xbox head <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has reiterated Microsoft will support Switch 2, and dubbed Nintendo a "great partner".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2 will be released on 5th June</a>, with reports that Microsoft titles such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">Flight Simulator and Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be arriving on the platform</a> at some point in 2025. Meanwhile in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-agrees-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-if-activision-blizzard-buyout-goes-through">Microsoft agreed a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo</a> if its then-to-be-finalised buyout of Activision Blizzard was completed (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">which it was in October 2023</a>).</p>
<p>Now, Spencer has spoken further about Microsoft's support for the Switch successor, and stated that Nintendo's consoles were "a unique way for us to reach players who aren't PC players, who aren't players on Xbox".</p>

<p>"It lets us continue to grow our community of people that care about the franchises that we have, and that's really important for us to make sure we continue to invest in our games," the Xbox head told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/">Variety</a> when asked about any Switch 2 projects.</p>
<p>"I'm really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future."</p>
<p>This week's comment echoes Spencer's previous words regarding Microsoft's support of Nintendo. In November last year, the Xbox exec said there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">nothing stopping any of the company's games coming to Nintendo or PlayStation platforms in the future</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in January, Spencer spoke with Gamertag Radio, confirming Xbox would be supporting the Switch 2, adding he had exchanged messages with Nintendo's Shuntaro Furukawa following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">that initial console teaser</a>.</p>

<p>As for if the Switch 2 reveal had put any sort of pressure on Xbox to reveal what its forthcoming hardware plans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-2025-gaming-handheld-teased-in-new-trailer">including an Xbox handheld</a> - Spencer said it hadn't.</p>
<p>"I think all of us in this industry should focus on our communities and the player base that we're building," Spencer continued. "I get inspired by what a lot of different creators do and other platform holders. But I believe in the plans that we have.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we're evolving what it means to be Xbox and meeting players in so many different places. There are 3 billion people who play video games on the planet and I get up every morning and think about how Xbox can be more relevant to the 3 billion people who play. And that's through making sure we're leading in how our games and our platform features can be available in as many places as possible, whether that's Cloud, whether it's people playing on PC, whether it's people playing on console.</p>
<p>"So we're really driven by trying to grow our franchises and our platform to be an important part of gaming for as many of those 3 billion gamers as we can reach."</p>

			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds mod called Tex Decompressor Tool is now available for download, significantly improving stuttering issues on a good number of system configurations.</p>
<p>The tool, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/951?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and is fully compatible with the game's latest version, is used to create a patch pak with uncompressed textures, which can improve frame rate stability but will take up more disk space with both the regular textures and the ones included in the High Resolution texture pack. The process can be somewhat complicated, but Nexus Mods member <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/users/134767873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mox9291</a> provided a handy tutorial in the mod's comment section on how to use the tool and enjoy the more stable performance granted by the removal of the decompression step that can cause stuttering issues even on powerful systems.</p>
<p>As I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a> earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the best entries in the series, so much so that it's easy to look past some of its shortcomings. While the performance issues still have to be addressed, CAPCOM has started providing more challenging hunts this month with the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Title Update</a>, which introduced returning monster Mizustune and its Tempered variant as well as the high rank variant of campaign final boss Zoh Shia. Another challenging monster, Arch tempered Rey Dau, will be made available later this month, though PC hunters can use some <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mods-custom-quests-new-monster/">mods</a> to take on the new variant of the Apex predator right now.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The 8 nm chip powering the Nintendo Switch 2 may be a disappointing choice for some, but there's the chance that it has been chosen to allow the easy creation of upgraded system revisions based on node shrinks.</p>
<p>Speaking during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> commented on the system's Samsung 8 nm chip, suggesting that it may have been picked not only for economic reasons, as Nintendo likely got a deal on a production line that is no longer producing that many chips, but also to keep the door open for hardware revisions based on node shrinks. A future console revision on a 5 nm class node, which also includes a 4 nm node, could do wonders for battery life, which leaves something to be desired in the launch system, as it is estimated to be 2 hours at minimum, half an hour less than the battery life of the launch original Switch model. A node shrink would also open the way for a portable-only Nintendo Switch 2 Lite, as battery life in such a system would be extremely important to make it an enticing purchase. Considering Nintendo would want to bundle all of its&nbsp;key tech improvements together, an OLED model will likely also follow with a node shrink.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Mid-Gen Refresh Potential: Are New OLED and Lite Models Possible?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nc0ieceoQKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Nintendo has always released hardware revisions for almost every one of its systems with only a few notable exceptions, there's little doubt that Nintendo Switch 2 revisions will be made at some point, so it will be very interesting to see if Digital Foundry's speculation ends up aligning with Nintendo's plans. For the time being, however, those who wish to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, besides other exclusives, have no choice but to purchase the only console model that is launching on<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/"> June 5th.</a></p>

Surging Sparks and Journey Together booster packs are back at reasonable prices, and the Azure Legends tin is a smart pickup if you're looking for variety in a single purchase. These items have been tough to grab without markups, so it's a good time to stock up while they’re available and shipping with Prime.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon 151 Booster Bundle, Surging Sparks, and Journey Together Restocks</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 151 Booster Bundle has also returned to Amazon, but don’t be fooled by the listed discount. Despite being marked as 20 percent off, the current $66.65 price is nearly double its original MSRP, which typically ranges from $30 to $35. If you’ve been trying to complete this nostalgic set, it's at least back in stock, but from a value standpoint, the deal is questionable.</p><div id="218684" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Add MLB.TV and Get $30 Off Your First Month of Sling</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Now through May 31, you can tack on MLB.TV and stream every single out-of-market game and get $30 off your first month of Sling TV.

It’s marketed as a great way to access the set without buying a full booster display box, and it consistently sells out quickly. Still, at nearly twice the standard retail price, it’s worth thinking twice unless you’ve had trouble finding it elsewhere.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-sleeved-b"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved B">Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved Booster Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218824"><div id="218824" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved Booster Pack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently the number one best-seller in collectible booster packs on Amazon, Surging Sparks includes over 250 cards, new Pokémon ex, ACE SPEC cards, and more than 50 cards featuring special illustrations.

Nine booster packs, full-art N’s Zorua promo, card sleeves, energy, dice, the works. I’ve seen this box selling for $90+ since launch, so $70.31 from Amazon is genuinely solid. Lillie’s Clefairy ex is still floating around $180 and N’s Zoroark ex has dropped to $13, which tells me the hype has deflated and we’re in “buy because it’s fun” territory again. I like it here.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218701"><div id="218701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the low-frills version for people who just want to open packs without pretending they’re going to organize their collection. Six Journey Together boosters and none of the ETB fluff. Honestly, this is how I like to test a set when prices cool off. You still have a shot at cards like Salamence ex SIR, which tanked from $250 to around $106, or a sub-$20 N’s Reshiram. Even if you pull nothing, at least you didn’t overpay trying to win the cardboard lottery.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218703"><div id="218703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I threw one of these in my cart last week just to hit the free shipping minimum.

And if you happen to land something like Articuno’s Illustration Rare (now $18.69) or Wailord (around $14.55), it’s a nice win from a $10 impulse buy.</p></div><p id="train-sim-world-5-route-remix-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle">Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218704"><div id="218704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know how many people wake up wanting ten train simulator add-ons, but if you’re one of them, today is your day.

It’s Steam keys, it supports CALM, and the value is so off the rails (pun fully intended) that I bought it just to mess around with the Railpool BR193 Vectron. Don’t judge me.</p></div><p id="lepro-o1-ai-floor-lamp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp">Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218705"><div id="218705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of those “tech that doesn’t make sense until you try it” products.

It’s absurdly bright at 2300 lumens, and it looks clean in any corner setup. The AI stuff isn’t just fluff either. Say “I want relaxing light” and it’ll give you ten preset scenes.

			<p>While the rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster has finally been proven to be real, it will take some time to learn more about the Fallout 3 remaster that was revealed at the same time as the soon-to-be-released remaster.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remaster of the third entry in the series, which was revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> besides the Oblivion remaster, saying that it will be a while before we see it, without providing any additional information. If Microsoft and Bethesda stick to the timeframes detailed back in 2023, we should be seeing more of the Fallout 3 remaster in around two years or so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be a while before we see it.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1912227284511273452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As already mentioned, the existence of a Fallout 3 remaster is essentially a given at this point, with the confirmation that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is real and possibly coming very soon. Following weeks of rumors and speculation, the first few screenshots of the remaster leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">yesterday</a> via the official website of the developer who was long rumored to be working on it, Virtuos. Unfortunately, we still don't know if the remaster will sport gameplay improvements besides the visual upgrade powered by Unreal Engine 5, but thankfully it won't be long to see if and how the experience will have been improved, as the remaster is said to be released next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Later this year, we'll also get the fan-made Oblivion-to-Skyrim port called Skyblivion, and the team lead has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the official remaster.</p>

            <p>Developers InnerSloth and Schell Games have announced the release date of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> 3D on PC.</p>
<p>The upcoming 3D release of the space-set social deduction game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-3d-announced-demo-out-next-week">first announced in February of this year</a>, but with that all important release date missing. That has changed now, however, with confirmation Among Us 3D launches on PC via Steam on 6th May.</p>
<p>"MARK IT IN YOUR CALENDARS," the Among Us team proclaimed on social media, with a confident use of caps lock. "3D BEANS COMING TO UR SCREENS SOON AAAAAA."</p>

<p>As to what players can expect on Among Us 3D's release, well, it'll be pretty much just like the Among Us that blew up in popularity during 2020, but with an extra dimension.</p>
<p>"In this party game, Crewmates work together to complete tasks before one or more Impostors kill everyone aboard. Experience all of the same deception and deceit as the original Among Us in all three dimensions," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">reads the game's Steam page description</a>.</p>

<p>Away from games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-sci-fi-social-deduction-is-getting-the-animated-adaptation-treatment">Among Us is being turned into an animated series</a>.

<p>Since then, famous faces such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animation-cast-rounded-out-with-jurassic-park-ratatouille-talent">Elijah Wood, Wayne Knight and Ashley Johnson have been announced as voicing various crewmembers</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Niantic has made 68 employees redundant as part of its company restructuring process <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">following the sale of its gaming portfolio to Monopoly Go maker Scopely - a deal worth $3.5bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
The deal has seen Scopely become owner of Niantic games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, and the new employer of the teams that work on those titles. 
</p>
<p>
These layoffs, meanwhile, come from the remaining staff at Niantic working on other projects, as the organisation slims down and effectively rebrands as a startup, named Niantic Spatial.
</p>
<p>
Niantic had previously warned of job losses among its remaining team as part of this process. Now, as detailed in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-is-laying-off-68-employees-after-selling-its-game-business-for-3-5-billion">Game Developer</a>, we know how many.
</p>
<p>
The company has declined to comment further about the job losses.
</p>
<p>
Niantic Spatial will focus on a refreshed version of Niantic's original core interest - creating a digital map of the planet, now using geospatial AI. The newly-rebranded company has secured $250m of capital investment, $50m from Scopely and $200m from Niantic's own balance sheet in order to move forward.
</p>
<p>
"We're in the midst of seismic changes in technology, with AI evolving rapidly," Niantic founder John Hanke wrote recently on Niantic Spatial's focus. "Existing maps were built for people to read and navigate but now there is a need for a new kind of map that makes the world intelligible for machines, for everything from smart glasses to humanoid robots, so they can understand and navigate the physical world.
</p>
<p>
"Today's LLMs represent the first step towards a future where a variety of expert models collaborate to reason and understand complex problems, and many of those problems will require deep and accurate knowledge of the physical world. Niantic is building the models that will help AI move beyond the screen and into the real world."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer recently travelled to a major Pokémon Go fan event in Italy, held shortly after the sale was announced, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amidst-pokemon-gos-35bn-sale-fans-flock-to-italys-first-major-meetup-with-mix-of-emotions-over-games-future">heard of players' mixed emotions regarding Scopely now being in charge</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Here at Wccftech, we have followed the long development of the Skyblivion project for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over eight years</a>. For nearly a decade, an ambitious team of modders has strived to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Ever since early 2023, we have known that the team was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting 2025</a> as their tentative release window for the total conversion mod. Later that year, though, the infamous FTC vs. Microsoft trial leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda had plans to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 one, interestingly).</p>
<p>I was already in touch with Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-qa-with-skyblivion-lead-dev-hopes-dreams-and-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having interviewed him</a> in late 2022 about the modding and remastering potential of NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform. Needless to say, I immediately reached out again to gauge his reaction to that leak. Back then, though, he didn't really buy that it was true. I pointed out those were official documents, so the project might have been canceled or delayed, but it was surely in existence at some point.</p>
<p>For a while, it&nbsp;<span>seemed like the Oblivion remaster might have been canceled. Throughout 2024, there were no further leaks or rumors. Everything changed in 2025, though, as the first concrete leaks appeared,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a>&nbsp;that Virtuos had worked on it using Unreal Engine 5. Over the last few weeks, insiders have begun&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a> that Microsoft could be planning a shadow drop—a game announcement and release at the same time—</span>at some point in April.</p>
<p>At last, visual evidence of Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materialized yesterday</a> when fellow Internet sleuths found the game's first screenshots on the developer's website. Just a couple of hours later, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140?s=46&amp;t=iYm9jOtB1G3D9hHCMqQ8dw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a brief comment on X</a>, having dealt with the fact that it was all real:</p>
<p><em>The real remake is the friends we made along the way.</em></p>
<p><em><span>To be clear, this changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year.</span><span> All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster.</span></em></p>
<p><iframe title="SKYBLIVION Live Development Stream[LIKING THE STREAM IS APPRECIATED]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-ZsA-zHUJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Later yesterday, I spoke briefly with him to get an expanded reaction:</p>
<p><em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different than what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>For what it's worth, I think there's definitely space for both Skyblivion and Oblivion Remastered. The former might not be as visually impressive (although I'm sure at least some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Skyrim graphics features</a> can be ported to it), but it will feature both cut content and new content, as well as other gameplay changes. From what we know of the official remaster based on the leaks, there should be some gameplay changes to make it more modern, but no restored or new content. As Rebelzize put it, users can choose between two versions of Oblivion, and that can only be a good thing. By the way, I've also asked him whether the plan is still to launch in 2025, and the answer was yes.</p>

            <p>What up, murder brothers. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> just got a new PvE mission, featuring the somewhat cranky Trygon, a big Tyranid beastie with more arms than is generally prudent. The boss will burst out of the sands of planet Avarax to stab you with said arms, but only after you hunt him down for a bit. Better take the new weapon the developers are also adding in this update: the Inferno pistol. If you want to see how shiny and well-painted these new additions look (you Warhammer freaks always do) then come gander at the trailer. </p>

<p>You're off to this dusty ruin to pick up a reluctant Tech-Priest who has refused to evacuate. But of course the spiky-limbed Trygon is going to make that difficult. "It bursts from the ground to unleash devastating assaults with its scything claws and bio-electric attacks," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500569576639038653">an update post</a> from developers Saber Interactive.</p>
<p>They've also added that new handgun, the Inferno pistol, to both PvE and PvP modes, a "close-range thermal weapon" that can be used by four of the game's marine classes: Assault, Vanguard, Sniper and Heavy. And to make multiplayer PvP a little spicier, they've also opened up other weapons to classes who previously couldn't use them. The Sniper class can now use the Heavy Bolt Pistol and Instigator Bolt Carbine, for example. </p>
<p>There's a small cloister of other stuff. You can now host private multiplayer lobbies, there are some new wolfish skins to buy, alogside new shades of blue and pink to spraypaint onto your little space fascists. You can read <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/191-7-0-patch-notes">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Before you go bug hunting, let me do a little lore research. Ah, yes, here we go. "The Trygon is a colossal serpentine creature whose iron-hard carapace is proof against all but the heaviest of weapons and whose giant talons can scythe through even the most formidable battle-tank," reads a description of the creature on <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/Tyranid-Trygon">Warhammer's website</a>. Good to clear things up. For me, a "Trygon" sounds like a shape you've never heard of but are asked to draw on graph paper in a high school entrance exam.  </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I'm not a big Warhammer dude. Although I did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">review Space Marine 2</a> and found it to be a pretty decent third-person insect repellant, with some well-crafted environments and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-bloody-battles-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-make-for-a-great-photo-mode">great photo mode</a>. Edwin had some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">more nuanced thoughts</a> on its depiction of goosestepping masculinity, worth a read even if, like me, you approach your blockbuster games with bubblegum-chewing aloofness, always ready to spit it out the moment all the flavour is gone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last month, "Mark Corrigan's Oblivion" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-getting-a-barber-mode-and-by-golly-i-hope-i-can-actually-be-a-barber">free barber mode update</a>, and now with yesterday's release of <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2-4">Patch 1.2.4</a>, you can finally have those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>barbers shave Henry of Skalitz boiled butter bean bald. Did baldness signify nail-hard bastardry in medieval times, or simply some kind of maledicted scalp leprosy? Hopefully it's the former. Henry'll need to look tough to survive the new Hardcore mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first casualty of this set of difficulty modifiers is Henry's sense of direction. You'll no longer know exactly where you are on the map, and your compass won't show cardinal directions either. Instead, you'll have to ask NPCs where you are to get your bearings, and look to the heavens to guide your way. No fast travel, either.</p>
<p>There's a selection of 10 negative perks to choose before you start the game, of which you'll have to pick three. For example, you can give Henry a chance to throw his back out while picking herbs, a personal favourite for how mundane and insulting it is. The underground herb economy isn't what it used to be either - the patch also promises a rebalance so "they never sell for a higher price than their buying price". Tracking down a full list of the perks has been a little tricky, but here's an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kcd2-hardcore-mode-perks-tXGwZsn">Imgur gallery with just that</a>.</p>
<p>There's also no combat UI, enemies are more aggressive, and if you get branded for going on a crime spree, there's a perk that makes the brand permanent. I like the sound of it overall. There's a few instances of flat number tweaking, but I can see things having to ask NPCs for directions make the world feel absorbingly textured. I've actually been waiting for this patch to have a proper playthrough. If you don't fancy any of this, the hardcore medieval roleplayers over at Nexusmods are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/kingdomcomedeliverance2">already cooking up fixes</a> for basically everything interesting about the new mode. What are they like, eh!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has revealed another new playable character in its forthcoming co-op spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Raider is a powerful barbarian warrior in typical style, wearing a fur cloak and horned helmet while wielding a gigantic axe for slow but mighty attacks.</p>
<p>He looks to be a strength build, then, in contrast to the more nimble previously revealed characters. Yet he has a fierce ultimate ability that benefits all players.</p>

<p>The trailer for Raider shows him screaming with rage to summon a pillar of rock from the ground. This can then be clambered up by all characters.</p>
<p>From there we see the archer Ironeye sniping at a boss from above, while Raider himself leaps off for a plunging axe swipe.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is yet to reveal all of Raider's abilities, but it's easy to see how he'll fit neatly into the roster of playable characters.</p>
<p>The final game will include eight Nightfarers to choose from and so far six have been revealed.</p>
<p>The network test included the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess. Then, earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-elden-ring-nightreign-playable-character-revealed">sniping Ironeye was revealed</a>.</p>
<p>Still, eagle-eyed fans spotted both Raider and Ironeye in the game's initial trailer, though their names and abilities were unknown.</p>
<p>One other yet-to-be-revealed character can be seen too: she's in gold armour and wields a katana with golden magic. Perhaps that hints at a Faith build?</p>
<p>That leaves one unknown character left. What kind of build are you hoping for?</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will be released on 30th May across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One.</p>

			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Jagex <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-is-a-co-op-open-world-survival-crafting-game-due-soon-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, an open world survival crafting game set in its beloved fantasy universe. The UK developer said back then that the Steam Early Access launch would launch sometime in Spring but did not provide a specific date. It was, therefore, surprising to see the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become available without any further announcements on Valve's store</a> a few hours ago, priced at £24.99 GBP / $29.99 / €29.99.</p>
<p>Jesse America, Executive Producer of this game, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to surprise players with our Early Access launch today and invite them to discover the magical world of RuneScape: Dragonwilds right now. We’ve been working hard to develop an entirely new type of RuneScape experience that ignites fans’ passion, creativity and love for questing, and provide them with an all-new RuneScape adventure to discover. And this is just the start of our development journey. Throughout Early Access, we’ll be updating the game regularly with new content and features, while listening closely to the community to deliver an iconic open world survival crafting game that is loved equally by our biggest RuneScape fans and new players alike. Our community is at the heart of everything we do at Jagex and we look forward to seeing how they shape RuneScape: Dragonwilds throughout our Early Access journey.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="RuneScape: Dragonwilds | Official Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnPPTCHNqzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, early user reception seems quite positive. The average user review score is 79% for the time being. Jagex also outlined the Early Access roadmap. There will be constant improvements to the following areas: combat, performance, multiplayer, difficulty, lighting, weather, messaging, and tutorials. New magic, ranged, and farming skills will be introduced, as well as new quests, gear, lore, music, animals, and a new enemy type, the lesser dragons. Moreover, the base building mechanics will be expanded, and the Hardcore and Creative modes will be added. Last but not least, a whole new region called Fellhollow will be introduced.</p>
<p>This zone is said to be suspended between life and death. A twisted dragon called Imaru is its overlord, and various undead enemies will populate Fellhollow. Players will be guided here by Death, a well-known character to RuneScape fans.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is being immortalised in pixel form thanks to Bionic Bay.</p>
<p>Bionic Bay is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-day-of-the-devs-2024-indie-games-showcase">upcoming "precision-puzzle platformer" that casts players as a scientist</a>. It's coming from developers Mureena Oy and Psychoflow Studio, and is all set in an "ancient bio-mechanical world" which has been "hand-crafted pixel by pixel to create a high-fidelity, atmospheric environment". The game is set to release across both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida may have now left PlayStation</a>, his legacy will certainly live on, and the former exec has now been announced as an unlockable character skin. Not only that, he even has his own "special" level.</p>

<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/14/the-making-of-hand-crafted-pixel-art-platformer-bionic-bay-out-april-17-on-ps5/">PlayStation blog</a>, Bionic Bay creative director Juhana Myllys said the team was "ecstatic" to reveal its collaboration with Yoshida.</p>
<p>Yoshida's level will be available via the upcoming game's online challenge mode. "If you take part and beat Shu's score, you can even unlock our Shu skin," the developer wrote.</p>
<p>This skin, once unlocked, will allow players to customise the look of their scientist for Bionic Bay's online leaderboards. You can see how it looks via the image below.</p>
<p>Following a slight delay, Bionic Bay will release tomorrow, 17th April.</p>

<p>Bionic Bay isn't Yoshida's only video game collaboration post-PlayStation.

His role is a bright green, bird-like mascot called MonouGe who "just loves games".</p>
<p>Away from starring roles in video games, earlier this week Yoshida made headlines for his thoughts on Nintendo's next console, suggesting that positioning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> as simply a bigger and better follow-up to Switch 1 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">damaging to the company's brand identity</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Surprisingly, Rusty Rabbit isn’t a game about a malfunctioning toy for adults. Instead, it’s the tale of Rusty Stamp, a loveable, Wolverine-voiced, floppy eared scamp, who pilots his mech to dig through ancient tunnels on a mission to uncover valuable scrap.</p>
<p>Best described as a 2D Metroidvania, Rusty Rabbit has the labyrinthine maps to explore most associated with the genre. However, each map is divided into numerous dungeons, with plenty of teleporters to return Rusty to his garage. Here Rusty can tinker with his mech, turning all that loot he’s been gathering into new upgrades; bigger guns, rocket boosters, better drills, you get the idea. Due to the segmented structure of its dungeons, along with ample save points, Rusty Rabbit is nice and accessible, making it an ideal for Metroidvania newcomers.</p>

<p>Rusty spends most of his time drilling through blocks to progress through a level. Initially this is rather dull, our hero forced to demolish blocks one at a time in a dreary fashion. To be honest, this state of affairs goes on rather too long, and the pacing of the game suffers as a result. However, stick with it and the game will open up, allowing Rusty to set off chain reactions to satisfyingly destroy vast swathes of blocks, or boost himself like a rocket through walls of scrap, the controller vibrating as the player steers Rusty like a guided missile. This makes for some enjoyable puzzles that tickle the brain pleasantly, even if all too often your objective is little more than ‘find the key card to open the door’.</p>
<p>Story-wise this is charming stuff, Rusty is an engaging lead, chatting away to the player like a classic film noir Private Investigator. Sometimes he can be too verbose, taking an age to explain even the simplest situations, particularly when recounting his unlockable series of backstory monologues. Still, hammering the skip button will soon see you through the most wearisome moments. Where the script and story glows are in the character interactions between Rusty and the loveable band of treasure-hunting bunnies he meets on his expeditions. An eccentric yet endearing gang of misfits, the way they melt Rusty’s stone-cold heart over the course of the game is surprisingly moving.</p>


<p>Combat is Rusty Rabbit’s weak point. Fighting Rust Bots mostly amounts to little more than Rusty standing in front of his foe, the player holding down the button until their death occurs. It’s very difficult to discern if Rusty has been hit or not, the only visual reaction being the slow depletion of his health bar. All of the dynamic movement and momentum of the exploration is lost, resulting in static and tedious fisticuffs.</p>
<p>Matters are made worse by how much combat Rusty Rabbit forces upon you, demanding you clear an area of enemies before being allowed to finally leave. You’d think gunplay would improve matters, but most of the cannons are so ineffectual that they go unused, resulting in all-too-frequent combat that is a trudge to get through. Thankfully, combat is easy, so you won’t get stuck, you just won’t have much fun getting through it.</p>
<p>Overall though, there’s plenty here to keep you playing, with dashings of charm, some great exploration, engaging puzzle solving, and a welcome gentle difficulty to see you hopping though to the game’s conclusion.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rusty Rabbit is good, simple, rather old-school, fun. Sure, the flat and uninspired combat means this Bunny lacks a bit of hop, but it still bounds along at a gentle pace, providing a satisfying Metroidvania without the insurmountable difficulty of others in the genre.	</p></div>

			<p>As we get closer to the game's launch date, publisher 505 Games and developer MercurySteam are posting regular new Blades of Fire trailers focused on different areas of the single player action/adventure title. The latest one dives into combat, which is a major part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Weapons are split into three categories: slashing, piercing, and blunt types, with some weapons having the option of swapping between both slashing and piercing. To ensure you're using the</em><br>
<em>right weapon for the job, check the enemy's outline for their weak points and cycle through your equipped weapons. Fighting with the right weapon and targeting an enemy's weak points ensures that you'll make quick work of all those you come up against.</em></p>
<p><em>Make use of the terrain by sticking to the higher ground to gain the advantage in battle. Adso is also here to assist. He will analyze and document every enemy you encounter, recording all the details in his chronicle. The more you face each enemy type, the more detailed Adso's notes will become, revealing their lore and better strategies to defeat them. Defeating a certain number of enemies wielding the same weapon will unlock that weapon's forging scroll. Once the scroll is collected, the new weapon will be ready for you to forge, thus further improving your arsenal.</em></p>

<p>At GDC 2025, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with Blades of Fire</a> and came away with a positive first impression of the game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X starting May 22. You can read the full system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
