            <p>The Finals' 3.4 update rolled out across PC and PS5 last week, but Xbox fans have yet to experience the shorter wait-times and party chat as the patch hasn't yet been released on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Developer Embark has apologised for the "lengthy delay" for the Xbox update, but whilst it's "currently working together with" Microsoft to resolve the issue, it's unable to provide an ETA as to when the hold-up will be resolved.</p>

<p>"We're currently working together with Microsoft on the situation that's blocking the 3.4 release on Xbox. I currently don't have an ETA for when we will be able to release, but as soon as I learn anything, I will share it with all of you," said Embark's Oscar in the official Discord channel.</p>
<p>"We're super sorry for this lengthy delay, and can only ask that you're patient with us as we work through it."</p>
<p>The Finals seemed to get off to a strong start when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-the-finals-has-stealth-dropped-and-is-available-right-now">surprise-launched in December</a> last year - its 5v5 action proving popular enough that its developer, Nexon subsidiary Embark Studios, quickly found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-ups-anti-cheat-measures-following-popular-launch">scrambling to deal with an influx of cheaters</a>. Since then, however, the destruction-focused free-to-play shooter has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destructive-shooter-the-finals-hasnt-performed-as-well-as-expected-says-publisher">"lower than expected" performance</a> according to publisher Nexon, contributing to a shortfall in its forecast revenue.</p>
<p>"Embark Studios' multiplayer shooter dazzles in the moment, but its AI voices are symptomatic of a broader issue with artistic vision," wrote contributor Rick Lane in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">three star review</a>.</p>

					<p>With rising development costs and general economic issues that have had a widespread impact on the video game industry, major publishers and developers are not as willing to experiment and launch new IPs as much as they were ten or twenty years ago. Sustained by the massive success of the latest entries in cornerstone franchises like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter</a>, CAPCOM seems to be the only major publisher that still takes risks. Following the release of the relatively solid Exoprimal (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoprimal-support-is-already-over-one-year-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortlived</a>) last year, the Japanese publisher is launching another experimental title called Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, a combination of tower defense and action games that provides an engaging experience, even with some shortcomings.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240706125101_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite its beautiful traditional Japanese setting being ripe for great storytelling, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess sadly doesn't feature much of a story. The insatiable greed of man, at some point in the story of this world, awakened the Seethe, underlings of the defiled Mountain Goddess, sweeping the land and stealing the masks of the villages' ancestral deities, spreading defilement in their wake and taking possession of the shrine at the summit of Mr. Kafuku. The only ones who can banish the Seethe and restore order are the Maiden Yoshiro and her protector Soh, who must travel down the mountain to reclaim the stolen masks and perform the Ceremony of Purification, which will open the path to the temple at the summit and grant them the chance of banishing the Seethe for good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is all there is to the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess story. The Maiden Yoshiro and her protector Soh are silent characters and don't go through any development in their journey. The rescued villagers are mostly generic NPCs with limited lines of dialogue during gameplay and are only roughly defined by a text description hidden in an in-game menu. To be fair, however, there's no denying that Yoshiro and Soh are immediately recognizable thanks to their visual design and especially their animations, making the many cutscenes quite pleasing to watch. As such, those who expected a deep, compelling narrative to make this journey more meaningful would do well to temper their expectations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240706133145_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess delivers much better when it comes to gameplay, thanks to its unique blend of genres. During the game's 20-hour or so campaign, players control Yoshiro's protector, Soh, who has to create a path called Spirit Path that the maiden can traverse to reach the main, tainted Torii Gate of each stage to purify it. Reaching this gate, however, is no easy feat. For starters, Soh and Yoshiro start each regular stage with no help, forcing the protector to explore to free villagers from their bonds and purify the defilement that has gripped the location. By doing so, Soh can not only enlist the help of the freed villagers but also obtain the powerful Crystals used to assign different roles to them and carve the Spirit Path.</p>
<p>These roles are extremely varied and range from the balanced Woodcutter role to more specialized ones, such as Ascetic, who can slow down the Seethe for a few seconds; the defensive Sumo Wrestler, who is essentially a tank that can aggro enemies; the Spearman, an offense-focused role with high attack power; the Thief, who can discover treasure around the map; and the Shaman, a supportive role that can heal other villagers in combat. Villagers act independently from the player and will attack Seethe and activate their unique abilities depending on their action range, which can be expanded by spending another currency, Musubi. Additional abilities for all roles can also be learned via upgrades.</p>
<p>The action component of the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess experience is represented by Soh themselves. While villagers behave according to their assigned role, the protector is controlled directly by the player. More capable than any of the villagers, Soh can get rid of Seethe with ease thanks to a few handy combos, greater mobility, and some defensive options, like guarding and dodging. The action mechanics are rather straightforward and easy to understand, making it easy to get into the game, even for newcomers to all genres represented in the game.</p>
<p>Topping these mechanics is the gameplay flow of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which is dictated in a rather clever way by the passage of time. During the morning, players can explore freely and move around their villagers to prepare for the coming night when the Seethe appears, a feature that seems to have been inspired by Kentaro Miura's Berserk. The passage of time must also be taken into consideration to complete a stage, as Yoshiro takes time to traverse the Spirit Path, and leaving her out in the open at the start of the night could make defending her more difficult. If the Maiden dies, it is game over.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240706142044_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I have to admit that, for the first few hours, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess felt nothing more than a relatively solid game that seemed afraid to go all-in in both its action and tower defense components. While the game, right from the get-go, features a decent amount of different enemies against which some roles are more effective than others and introduces some varied scenarios (such as stages with multiple possible Spirit Paths, no action component, various contraptions that the carpenter must repair, multiple, moving Torii Gates from which the Seethe spawn and intense boss battles that play unlike the regular stages, forcing players to quickly switch from offense to defense as required by the situation), the experience felt a little too straightforward, due to the limited number of available roles and, most of all, Soh's limited combat capabilities.</p>
<p>After defeating the Batsu boss around 5 hours in, however, the experience opens up greatly. At this point, not only will you have plenty of different roles to assign to your villagers, but you will also unlock upgrades for Soh, allowing you to spend Musubi to unlock additional abilities such as additional sword guards slots for special abilities and talisman slots that grant passive skills to customize Soh with, a second fighting style based on draw attacks, Perfect Guard, Ukemi for quick recovery after getting knocked down, additional attacks, Archery Skills and even some command abilities to smooth out villagers management, such as the ability to make them assemble at Soh's current location.</p>
<p>This is accompanied by a map design that becomes even better than before, as maps start featuring more contraptions, paths placed on different levels, secrets, and so on that really bring out the best of the game's mechanics, requiring more adjustments on the fly that make the player really feel like the general of a very small army that has to adapt to the shifting conditions of the battlefield. The game really comes together at this point, making the first few hours feel more like an extended tutorial. The difficulty level, however, stays a little bit too low, in my opinion, even in the latter parts of the game, as a simple strategy such as placing villagers close to the Torii gates is usually more than enough to clear even the most difficult, multi-part long stages, which ends up damaging the experience a little. Thankfully, the various side objectives available for all stages provide an incentive to vary up the strategy a bit to fulfill them for rewards.</p>
<p>Exploring defiled locations and fighting Seethe isn't the only thing you will do in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, as the game features some simple base rebuilding mechanics. After releasing a village from defilement, it will be possible to assign villagers to rebuild it. These mechanics are rather straightforward, as rebuilding only occasionally requires resources that can be picked up in the village itself, but they provide some nice rewards, including Musubi for upgrades and a selection of collectibles that provide additional information on the game's world. They also provide some welcome respite from all the action, thanks to the soothing piano tracks that play while roaming about purified villages.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240706125549_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Powered by the same RE Engine that has been powering almost every CAPCOM game since the release of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess looks gorgeous. Despite the zoomed-back gameplay camera, all characters and locations look incredibly detailed. Characters, in particular, are made even better by the dance-like animations that give them a rather peculiar feel. The highly detailed character models also shine during the cutscenes that play every now and then during Yoshiro and Soh's journey.</p>
<p>Being a RE Engine-powered game, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess also runs quite well on PC. The port is undoubtedly very well done, featuring the full suite of features that are expected nowadays, such as NVIDIA DLSS, including Frame Generation and AMD FSR 3 support, ray tracing support, and a good selection of graphics options to tweak. There are also still previews of how the different settings impact visual quality and a VRAM usage indicator. With every setting maxed out, the game ran at an average of 77 FPS, 1% 55 FPS at 4K resolution, DLSS Quality setting, no Frame Generation, and max ray tracing during a benchmark session held in the Moegi Ridge stage on the machine used for the test (i7-13700F CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM). With Frame Generation enabled and ray tracing turned off, which is probably for the best given how it doesn't really improve visual quality all that much, the game ran at a much higher framerate, average 154 FPS, 1% Low 74, with little added input delay thanks to NVIDIA Reflex.</p>
<p>With almost every major publisher focusing on their more popular IPs, a game like Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is a breath of fresh air. Despite a slow start, a low challenge level, and an almost non-existent narrative, this action game-meets-tower defense experience is engaging and can be enjoyed by all sorts of players, even those who aren't typically into the genre. Hopefully, the game will turn into a series in the future, and a sequel will address the few shortcomings that hold Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess back a little.</p>

<p>While Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess may not be the best action game or the best tower defense game around, Yoshiro and Soh's journey is undeniably compelling. Thanks to great map, scenario, and enemy design, along with plenty of viable tactical options and a wide arsenal of abilities, this new IP from CAPCOM stands out as one of the most surprising titles of the year, held back only by minor issues, such as a shallow narrative and a low challenge level.</p>

<p>Live-action adaptations for games have proven to be a successful formula, with every game-based TV series managing to bring in a massive number of viewers. The new live-action series to watch out for is based on SEGA’s popular JRPG franchise, Like a Dragon: Yakuza. The series was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced last month</a> and is set to arrive on Amazon Prime on October 25. The actor set to play the iconic Kazuma Kiryu in Like a Dragon: Yakuza recently spoke about his feelings about playing this beloved character.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ryoma Takeuchi, renowned for his work in projects like Kamen Rider Drive and many more, recently shared his insights on Kazuma Kiryu with <a href="https://in.ign.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/210658/news/ryoma-takeuchi-star-of-amazons-like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-on-becoming-kazuma-kiryu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Japan</a>. Takeuchi was surprised at being offered the role, given his familiarity with the Like a Dragon: Yakuza franchise from playing the first game at his uncle’s place. He emphasized the careful consideration he gave to the role, acknowledging the ‘real challenge’ of playing a character from an existing work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-kazuma-kiryu-s-qualities">Kazuma Kiryu’s Qualities </h2>



<p>Takeuchi further elaborated, noting that Kiryu’s qualities, such as strength, physical prowess, and a sense of heroism, are more than just surface-level attributes. He emphasized just copying these qualities wouldn’t be enough. Therefore, in preparing for the Like a Dragon: Yakuza series, he had to ‘create Kiryu from scratch’, which allowed him to ‘link’ himself with Kiryu and ‘become one’ with the character.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-takeuchi-wishes-to-portray-kiryu-in-like-a-dragon-yakuza">How Takeuchi wishes to portray Kiryu in Like a Dragon: Yakuza</h2>



<p>Takeuchi adds that he wishes to show the fans his portrayal of Kazuma Kiryu instead of working on pre-conceptions. The actor studied the Like a Dragon: Yakuza series and understood the qualities that make Kiryu who he is and embodied them. Additionally, he has trained very hard to look the part and explained how he will change the character’s fighting style as time moves on in that world and as his character gains more experience. Similarly, Takeuchi has also worked on how the character’s emotions change as he ages and becomes more of a top dog in the underworld.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Takeuchi confidently stated that he had given his all to play the character in Amazon Prime Video’s Like a Dragon: Yakuza Live-Action series. He understands that there is ‘no point in trying to surpass the original game ‘; instead, he aims to show respect to the games while ‘creating something new as an artist’.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dlc-character-takeda-gets-proper-gameplay-reveal-ahead-of-year-2-reveal-at-comic-con<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> developer NetherRealm has released a gameplay trailer for final Year 1 DLC character Takeda ahead of his July 23 release date alongside Kameo character Ferra.</p><p>Takeda is one of the so-called Kombat Kids alongside Cassie Cage, Kung Jin, and Jacqui Briggs. The gameplay video, below, shows off a number of Takeda’s moves and combos, which revolve around his trademark bladed whips, as well as pre-fight interactions (Johnny Cage, for example, wants him to star in a superteam action movie).</p><p>It ends with a look at his fatality, which, as you’d expect from Mortal Kombat, is not for the faint of heart. Here Takeda wraps his hapless victim tightly in his bladed whips before slowly retracting them. Now that’s got to hurt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here's the official blurb on Takeda, from publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>Similar to his cousin Kenshi, Takeda Takahashi was raised a Yakuza. Unlike him, Takeda enjoyed this lifestyle. That's why he was chosen to end Kenshi’s crusade against his masters. The fight mortally wounded Takeda. Unwilling to let his cousin die, Kenshi rushed him to the nearest help: the Shirai Ryu. Even after Takeda was healed, Kenshi wouldn't release him. He feared that the Yakuza might kill him for failing his mission. Takeda resisted, attempting to escape repeatedly. But as the months passed, he began to appreciate the Shirai Ryu’s selfless commitment to Earthrealm, a contrast to his past lifestyle. Takeda swore to rip up Earthrealm's underworld by the roots, but he soon learns they are stronger and more tangled than he ever thought possible. In the new video, Takeda’s Shirai Ryu inspired moveset is on full display, including his ability to use serrated whips to pull and throw opponents, utilization of explosive kunai projectiles to extend combos, and mastery of teleportation to attack opponents from behind.</blockquote><p>Takeda is the last of the six Kombat Pack 1 DLC characters to come out, and joins Omni-Man from Invincible, Quan Chi, Peacemaker from the DCU, Ermac, and Homelander from The Boys. Dataminers have already unearthed evidence to suggest <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dataminer-unearths-what-looks-like-the-next-6-dlc-characters"><u>the next six DLC characters</u></a> coming to the gory fighting game as part of Kombat Pack 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/15/mortal-kombat-1-official-takeda-gameplay-trailer-thumbnail-1721054492272.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The gameplay video does not feature Ferra, however. Ferra is the small fighter who sat atop the hulking Torr as part of the combined Ferra &amp; Torr character from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-x">Mortal Kombat X</a>, and was set to hit Mortal Kombat 1 in Kameo form in June but was delayed to launch alongside Takeda on July 23.</p><p>Speaking of Kombat Pack 2, NetherRealm has confirmed plans to reveal the future of Mortal Kombat 1 during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/san-diego-comic-con-2024-panel-schedule-the-boys-transformers-one-and-more"><u>San Diego Comic-Con 2024</u></a>, in a panel set for 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK on Friday, July 26. Year 2 plans may include what Boon has already teased is set for Mortal Kombat 1, such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-story-dlc-confirmed-big-surprise-after-that"><u>story DLC and “a big surprise after that.”</u></a> Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat-2"><u>Mortal Kombat 2 movie</u></a> is due out October 24, 2025.</p><p>Takeda is available from July 23 to Mortal Kombat 1 Premium Edition or Kombat Pack 1 owners. The character is then available to buy a week later.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

"We are actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise and can’t wait to share more information in the future."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise.</p></div><p>Ubisoft hasn't been particularly kind to the Driver franchise recently, having not released a mainline game since 2011's Driver: San Francisco and Driver: Renegade 3D. A mobile game called Driver: Speedboat Paradise was released in 2014, but the franchise hasn't made a peep since.</p><p>Fans were therefore surprised by the 2021 announcement of a Driver TV show that would "focus on undercover agent and ex-racecar driver John Tanner as he tries to take down a crime syndicate."</p><p>No word on a franchise reboot came alongside it though, and Ubisoft's latest comment that "exciting projects related to the franchise" still leaves all things Driver up in the air. The fact Ubisoft is still thinking about Driver may be enough for some fans, however.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/26/driver-san-francisco-review">In our 8/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Driver: San Francisco has one game-changing, eyebrow-raising idea and it pulls it off with aplomb, infusing the OTT arcade racing with unparalleled variety and a ridiculous supernatural twist whilst staying true to its Seventies chase-movie roots."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Perhaps you’re looking for a racing wheel with force feedback that gives you a real feel for the road, or maybe you just want a casual, budget-friendly option for all the family. Buckle up and let’s take you for a spin!</p><h2><u><strong>The Best Racing Wheels for Xbox Series X|S</strong></u></h2><h2>1. Thrustmaster TMX Racing Wheel  </h2><h3>Best Xbox Series X|S racing wheel </h3><div id="197277" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Thrustmaster TMX Racing Wheel&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></p><div><p>The Thrustmaster TMX Racing Wheel&nbsp;is easily the best racing wheel for anyone trying to grind out Forza Motorsport races.</p></div></div><div><p>Rotation Range</p><p>270 - 900 degrees</p></div><div><div><p>Formidable force feedback</p></div><div><p> Pedals aren’t the best quality </p></div></div><p>The Thrustmaster TMX Racing Wheel is a great all-around entry-level wheel that comes in a convenient Xbox-friendly package. You can set up your kit and get to business quickly thanks to its system-recognised buttons and easy-to-use mount. Plus, the TMX also comes with a two-pedal set for no additional cost, giving you all the tools you need to start competing in your favorite racing games. </p><p>When it comes to getting a feel for the road, the TMX Racing Wheel uses a force feedback system that delivers a host of intense vibrations as you burn rubber across the biomes in Forza Horizon 5. Crossing intricate terrain will alter the reactive rumble, allowing you to react precisely as race environments shift.</p><h2>2. Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider</h2><h3>Best racing wheel for casual drivers on Xbox Series X|S</h3><div id="197278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider</h3></p><div><p>If you want the ultra-premium Ferrari experience when you're playing racing games, the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider can totally do that for you.</p></div></div><div><p>Rotation Range</p><p>240 degrees</p></div><div><div><p>Stylish Ferrari-red design </p></div><div><p>Not as realistic as other wheels on the market </p></div></div><p>If you’re a motorhead with a penchant for Charles Leclerc or Carlos Sainz, the Thrustmaster Ferrari 458 Spider might be the perfect match for you. With some glorious red rubber paneling and the iconic Ferrari logo at the center of the wheel, the Ferrari 458 Spider is nothing if not stylish. Designed with Xbox in mind, the 458 Spider has system-aligning buttons embedded in the wheel face. So, you won’t need to relearn any of the controls before you hit the road. </p><p>Unlike the force feedback system in other wheels, the 458 Spider uses a bungee cord system to fight against when driving. This form of linear resistance offers tension to turns, as the wheel will automatically correct itself if you lose your grip. It may not offer the most realistic experience on this list, but it does have plenty of compelling features that work perfectly for casual players or first-time racing wheel users who don’t want to break the bank.</p><h2>3. Logitech G923</h2><h3>The best mid-range racing wheel for Xbox Series X|S</h3><div id="197279" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Logitech G923</h3></p><div><p>The Logitech G923 is one of the best mid-range racing wheels on the market, and perfect for Xbox Series X|S.</p></div></div><div><p>Rotation Range</p><p>900 degrees</p></div><div><div><div><p>Leather grips are comfortable over long periods of use</p></div><div><p>Trueforce delivers great haptic feedback </p></div></div><div><p>Smaller wheel size isn’t true to life </p></div></div><p>Competitive Xbox racing sim players who want to upgrade their kit will find everything they're looking for in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g923-review"><u> Logitech G923</u></a>. With pleasantly textured leather grips and a 10.24-inch wheel, the G923 delivers a deluxe but grounded feeling within a more approachable price range. </p><p>The G923 also features Logitech’s Trueforce feedback tech. Which reads specific information in the game, like road surface texture, weather and tyres, and furnishes appropriate haptic feedback through the wheel. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g923-review"><u>The G923</u></a> conjures an immersive drive as a result and delivers tangible grit when making decisions in intense driving scenarios. One caveat to consider, however, is that Trueforce isn’t available for all games. If you have a specific game you like to play, we recommend checking the specs on the official store page so you won’t be let down. </p><h2>4. Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel</h2><h3>Best premium racing wheel for Xbox Series X|S</h3><div id="197280" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel</h3></p><div><p>Don't let the $999 price tag scare you away, the Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel is a luxurious peripheral that you won't regret.</p></div></div><div><p>Rotation Range</p><p>1080 degrees</p></div><div><div><p>True-to-life wheel size feels superb</p></div><div><p>Trueforce haptic feedback offers immersive racing </p></div></div><p>For those wanting a more deluxe wheel, the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-racing-wheel-review"><u> Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel</u></a> has all the bells and whistles you want in a lavish, comfortable frame. The size of the wheel itself is true to life, with robust grips and a metal plate at its center. When paired with the wheel's responsive controls and force feedback, staying to the course on straights or tilting into turns is a lifelike experience – adding palpable tension whether you’re coasting ahead of competitors or fighting to get back to the front of the pack.</p><p>Like the Logitech G923, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-racing-wheel-review"><u>G Pro Racing Wheel</u></a> amps realism with Trueforce technology to test your mettle across various weather and track conditions. If this feature is your main selling point, make sure to check that your best-loved games are compatible to avoid disappointment down the line.</p><h2>5. Thrustmaster T128 </h2><h3>Best beginner racing wheel for Xbox Series X|S</h3><div id="197293" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Thrustmaster T128</h3></p><div><p>Want to get into racing wheels but don't know where to start? check out the Thrustmaster T128.</p></div></div><div><p>Rotation Range</p><p>Up to 900 degrees</p></div><p>When it comes to entry-level racing wheels that will last, you can’t do much better than the Thrustmaster T128, which pairs ample force feedback with reactive controls. Using the wheel is convenient, with an Xbox controller mirrored almost exactly in the wheel's face. Shifting gears with the responsive magnetic paddle shifts is a haptic experience, with the LED rev indicator on the wheel face providing a useful visual reminder of how hard you’re gunning through a circuit. </p><p>While there’s a lot to love about this beginner-friendly option, it’s important to note that the wheel doesn’t have grips, which can lead to discomfort over long periods, or, worse still, a loss of grip leading to botched maneuvers. Even so, the Thrustmaster T128 would be a fantastic addition to a budding sim racer, or for someone simply looking to scale up from the traditional controller.</p><h2>Upcoming Racing Wheels For Xbox Series X|S </h2><p><a href="https://uk.turtlebeach.com/pages/velocity-one-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Turtle Beach has joined the racing wheel market with the VelocityOn Race Wheel &amp; Pedal System</u></a>, which launched on February 26th, 2024. Coming in at $649.99, this new wheel boasts a 7.2Nm direct drive force feedback motor and dashboard race telemetry window to help players maximize their racing skills. This new wheel has been designed with Xbox Series X/S consoles in mind alongside PC and PS5, though its features may not be compatible with all driving games.</p><p>The VelocityOn Race Wheel &amp; Pedal system also features a modular control box for quick access to vehicle settings and mid-race toggles.</p><h2>How To Choose a Racing Wheel for Xbox Series X|S</h2><p>Choosing a racing wheel for your Xbox Series X|S can make your gaming experience way more immersive and fun. But there are a few factors and features to consider before making your final decision. </p><p>Although racing wheels come with various different features, not all of them work with every racing game. If a specific feature has caught your eye, it’s worth checking whether it’s going to make a difference across your favorite racing games.</p><p>One of the most important features you’ll want to pay attention to is force feedback. This gives you a realistic feel of the road, simulating bumps, turns, and the resistance of the car. If you want the most lifelike racing sim experience, your chosen racing wheel should include force feedback.</p><p>Similarly, a good racing wheel setup usually comes with pedals for acceleration, braking, and sometimes even a clutch. Some also include a shifter for manual gear changes. Decide if you want a basic two-pedal setup or a more advanced three-pedal system with a separate shifter. Again, this offers a more immersive and realistic feel, if that’s what you’re going for.</p><p>Durability matters, especially if you're a hardcore racer. When you’re purchasing a racing wheel for your Xbox Series X|S, look for wheels made of high-quality materials like metal and leather, which not only last longer but also feel better during those intense racing sessions. For longer gaming sessions, consider how comfortable the racing wheel is going to be. You might want to be able to adjust features like tilt and height. Also, check if the pedals' resistance can be adjusted to mimic real-life driving conditions.</p><p>As you’ve seen, there are great options available at various price points. Sometimes, spending a bit more can get you a wheel with better features and longevity, but there are also budget-friendly options that offer a solid racing experience.</p><h2>FAQ </h2><p><strong>How do you connect the racing wheel to the Xbox Series X|S?</strong></p><p>Each wheel may have a different method of pairing, though it’s easiest to consider this process similar to connecting a secondary controller. Typically, pairing will involve connecting the wheel via a USB cable to the console, turning on the console, and navigating to the Devices &amp; Accessories submenu to set up your new wheel. We recommend following the guide the brand outlines to ensure you don’t run into any issues.</p><p><strong>Which racing wheel brand is better – Logitech or Thrustmaster?</strong></p><p>Both brands offer a variety of experiences that suit players, and it ultimately comes down to use preferences and needs. For example, while Logitech offers TrueForce technology, it may not be eligible for your favorite game. Alternatively, the Thrustmaster T128 may have great haptic feedback for beginners, but the lack of comfort on the wheel might put you off. When choosing between brands, it’s best to look specifically at the specs and materials rather than the brand as a whole. </p><p><em>Sarah Thwaites is a freelance tech writer at IGN, with bylines at GameInformer, TrustedReviews, NME and more.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-crab-has-a-gun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The discourse surrounding the supposed difficulty of FromSoftware's games is so continual, tedious and toxic that I don't even like to think about it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hard-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> let alone talk about it</a>, let alone write about it on a website where people can message me after reading it to tell me how wrong I am.</p><p>And yet: is backing away from this discourse the same as backing away from a <em>Souls </em>game itself? Is <em>Souls </em>game difficulty discourse the <em>Souls</em> game of discourse?</p><p>Perhaps. If it <em>is</em>, let me talk to you about something that actually has both nothing and everything to do with FromSoftware: a game I call in my head <em>The Crab Game</em>, and which every time I talk about it have to go look up its actual name when the person I'm talking to about says please, Luke, that's not its actual name, I need to know what it's called.</p><p>(It's called <em>Another Crab's Treasure.</em>)</p><p>Developed by Aggro Crab, <em>Another Crab's Treasure</em> is, like (for example) <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>, essentially someone else's take on a <em>Souls </em>game. The map, the focus on precise combat for each and every enemy, the loot, the skills, the resting–this is very much a <em>Souls</em>-like. And as far as <em>Souls</em>-likes go, I think it's pretty good!</p><p>I say that, though, as someone who hates the actual <em>Souls </em>games, and yet really enjoyed <em>Jedi Survivor </em>(and now this) because they have the interesting bones of one (open world traversal, campfires) without the stuff I don't like (all the hard shit). To be clear, the main thing I don't enjoy in <em>Souls </em>games isn't the difficulty itself--I can play video games, thank you very much--but what it asks of me in order to do it.</p><p>I'm a solitary gamer who usually likes to play to unwind, to lose myself in a world, partake in a little downtime after a long day as a worker and a parent. <em>Souls </em>games require a level of concentration, effort and intensity that I'm just not interested in investing. The last thing I want to do at 11pm on a Wednesday night is sit hunched over a controller perfecting timing patterns and learning weaknesses over repeated trial, error and death. No thank you!</p><p>Maybe that <em>is </em>difficulty discourse; maybe it's just my own private expression of it and how it directly relates to my own habits and preferences. Whatever. The point is that <em>ACT </em>bypasses the discourse entirely by giving the crab a gun.</p><figure><figcaption>You can tick all or none of these options, nobody is going to care which you choose!</figcaption></figure><p>Buried in the options of <em>ACT </em>(which, admittedly, also have some more traditional difficulty concessions) is a check box. Tick it and suddenly your crab has a gun. A huge gun, a novelty cheque-sized gun, a gun so big it dwarfs the character and kinda breaks some of the game's animation. More importantly, this gun can instakill anything you point it at. This makes the game easier, I will grant it that, but that's not really the point. The point is, like we saw with <em>Control</em>--<a href="https://kotaku.com/more-games-could-use-invincibility-modes-like-control-s-1844931095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which also has a similar option, albeit without the comedic absurdity</a>--using it bypasses the idea of difficulty entirely.</p><p><em>ACT</em> is a very funny game! It's gorgeous, it's very well-written, the voice acting is outstanding, and it's a joy to simply wander its underseas vistas and meet everyone it has to offer. With the gun, even if it's late at night and I've had a shit day at work and my kids have been loud and I just want to relax for an hour, I can do that! Sometimes I don't want a challenge, I just want to get away from the challenges I'm already facing. This gun doesn't make the game easy, it simply removes all difficulty whatsoever.</p><p>If you don't want to use the gun, and play the game as its developers, Miyazaki, Twitter, Reddit and God intended, you can just not tick it. Pretend it's not even there. You will be fine, you can go about your life happy in the knowledge that nobody changed the game or its design, or undermined the skills you're very proud of in beating it.</p><p>If you're like me and you <em>do </em>want to use it, though, it's nice that it's there! I got to experience a world and some writing and some very funny characters that a devoted team spent years making and pouring their hearts into, and I would never have got to experience them if I'd died repeatedly at the first boss I ran into because I can't be arsed concentrating late on a school night.</p><figure><figcaption>It may not come across in screenshots and me just writing about it, but this gun is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in a video game</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The tool was retrofitted to benefit developer store changes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The eyebrow-raising context came when Valve explained why it made the change. "As social media platforms have evolved, so too have their APIs for connecting their services in order to perform the authentication loop," it wrote.

The write-up reveals some gameplay details, outlining some things we’ve already seen, like Zelda’s use of magic to summon creatures, but also mentions that players will use a sword and arrows to fight “as Link.” This was probably not how Nintendo hoped folks would find out, but at least ESRB doesn’t give any real context for how much of the game you play as Link. The reveal trailer’s opening moments show that there will be a point where Zelda is trapped, and it looks like there’s a playable segment in which Link must save her, so it’s entirely possible that the game starts with Link as the hero, only to shift perspectives after an opening level. The full description reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Zelda as she attempts to dispel rifts throughout Hyrule and rescue Link. From a ¾-overhead perspective, players explore various environments while fighting stylized enemies (e.g., humans, creatures). As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle. Some enemies can be defeated by being set on fire; other creatures dissolve into mist when defeated. Battle sequences are somewhat frenetic, with several enemies attacking/fighting at once.”</p></blockquote><p>Some are speculating that <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>may shift between Link and Zelda throughout the game, as Link disappears into a dark rift that overtakes part of Hyrule, and may have his own journey happening in tandem with Zelda’s above-ground. But whatever the case, it does sound like Link will be playable for at least <em>some </em>of the new game. While we can only speculate about how much of a role Link will play, we can also ponder things like where <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>takes place in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-might-actually-be-the-official-zelda-timeline-5869993&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-might-actually-be-the-official-zelda-timeline-5869993">the <em>Zelda </em>timeline</a></span>.

<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/FromHappyRock/status/1812003288193335509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, industry veteran and artist Nicholas Kole claimed that a fifth Crash Bandicoot game was in the works and ultimately cancelled some time ago.</p>



<p>This claim appeared in a thread about Project Dragon, the codename for an original IP. The embargo on its portfolio only just lifted. One fan asked if Project Dragon was related to Spyro, and Kole replied with the surprising claim about Crash Bandicoot.</p>



<p>Kole states that “some day folks will hear about the Crash 5 that never was and it’s gonna break hearts.” They did not offer further details about the game.</p>

</div></figure>







<p>In another reply, they add that Project Dragon and Crash Bandicoot 5 are separate cancelled projects. They clarify these were “two totally separate cancelled projects at two different studios.”</p>



<p>In May 2024, Toys For Bob did appear to gear up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/toys-for-bob-crash-bandicoot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a major announcement</a>. Its official site updated with a new logo, teasing a Tiki Mask. This is possibly a nod to the Crash Bandicoot series, but some speculate it’s a reference to Spyro instead.</p>



<p>Toys For Bob recently secured a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/toys-for-bob-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing partnership with Xbox</a> for its next game, but it still hasn’t announced the nature of the title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-event-saw-five-proposals-including-couples-who-met-while-playing-the-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Five couples got engaged at this summer's Pokémon Go Fest, some of whom met through playing the popular smartphone game. 
</p>
<p>
The proposals took place at the event's big weekend in Madrid - the year's main European meetup for Pokémon Go fans, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Eurogamer recently attended</a>. Happily, all players who popped the question received a 'yes'. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go developer Niantic asked fans ahead of time if any couples were planning to get engaged at the event, after hearing reports of players getting down on one knee at previous Go Fests. 
</p>

<p>
Five fans responded and were then invited to secretly surprise their other half by popping the question at a Pikachu and Eevee 'Meet and Greet' photo opportunity - meaning the moment could be captured on camera, with the aforementioned Pokémon celebrating/lurking in the background.
</p>
<p>
After meeting while playing Pokémon Go in a London park, Martina and Shaun (pictured above) got engaged at Go Fest after being together for eight years. Several years of that time had been spent long-distance, between England and Spain, before Shaun moved out to live together with Martina in Barcelona this year.
</p>
<p>
"It was just the right time," Martina said, after popping the question. "After eight years of relationship, the last six of them being long-distance, we have finally managed to settle in the same place.
</p>
<p>
"The game has helped us discover new places where we live and wherever we go and we really enjoy going for Pokémon Go walks (so does our dog)," she continued. "We share a passion for the game and we enjoy being outdoors a lot. It has also connected us to other local players that have now become essential in our lives."
</p>
<p>
Other couples who got engaged included Dutch couple Joris and Louise, the former of whom moved up his plans to pop the question when he saw Go Fest on the schedule.
</p>
<p>
"I told Louise we had won a VIP meet and greet with Pikachu and Eevee, but as the day went by I got more and more nervous and hoped she didn't see anything, as I was carrying the ring with me," Joris said. "She didn't expect anything and it was a real surprise!"
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Meanwhile, for Benidorm couple Ana and Daniel, it was third time lucky. The pair have known each other since 2018, and in 2020, amidst the Covid pandemic, Ana discovered she was pregnant with their now-three-year-old daughter. 
</p>
<p>
"When I told him I was pregnant, he asked me to marry him, but I didn't want to because I didn't feel ready, and didn't want to do it because of the baby."
</p>
<p>
Ana later reciprocated the proposal, but the couple decided to settle - until now - without labels for their relationship. 
</p>
<p>
"I wanted to surprise him!" Ana said about proposing again at Go Fest. "In the end, Pokémon Go has given me a good boyfriend (hopefully husband!), a three-year-old daughter, many friends in Benidorm and even others around the world."
</p>
<p>
After this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2024-dates-start-time-ticket-price-global-activities-9404">past weekend's Go Fest Global</a>, next up for Pokémon Go is the summer's Ultra Unlock events, which are set to see the launch of new species Tandemaus and the long-awaited debut of Mega Lucario.

<p>With racing simulators, there’s no name bigger in the world than iRacing. However, it’s not just true simulation games that the company is responsible for anymore. They are working on dirt racing, arcade titles, an official NASCAR game, and a <a href="https://www.iracing.com/orontes-games/exocross-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sci-fi themed rally-like racing</a> title known as ExoCross.</p>



<p>Developed by Orontes Games – whom iRacing acquired in 2021 – ExoCross is built on a completely custom engine that Orontes has mastered over the years. Mixed with things like AI and tire models from iRacing, ExoCross is a full package racer that you may not expect when looking at it from the outside.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ExoCross Final Preview - Our Impressions" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFxYsURcJtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The game offers you a number of modes, including Championship, Time Trials, Quick Races, and more. The Championship Mode can be viewed as the game’s story as it opens by explaining to you the premise of why you are racing on a different planet than earth. For the record, the game takes place 100 years in the future where all forms of fossil fuels and vehicles have been banned on earth.</p>







<p>There are three vehicles to choose from, each having their own pros and cons associated with their difficulty levels. For example, the Vulcan is easier to drive with its lower peak power and heavier weight while the lighter weight Titan can be tougher to keep stable due to its power, top speed, and the way it can slide on the track. Each car takes some time to get the hang of, but never feels too difficult, even with assists turned completely off.</p>



<p>There’s no upgrade options for your car. The only customization you can do is your number, decal, and the colors.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The AI battles on the track are the best part of the gameplay.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you race you’ll have access to boost that replenishes while you drive. If you happen to be in the draft of an opponent, you’ll see your boost meter increase quicker than if you are by yourself. It adds strategy to how you drive, especially if you have someone behind you. Breaking their draft is key to keep them off your back and you in front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s damage that you need to be aware of because despite these being giant metal cars that you’re controlling from a distance, they can still break. Drive too recklessly, and you’ll quickly find yourself either off the track or without a tire.</p>



<p>Going back to the AI, the battles you have, especially when you move to the higher difficulties, is as much fun in a racing game as you’ll get. Being side-to-side and bumping wheels while trying to not lose control is some of the most satisfying racing I’ve had in some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a simulation vs. arcade standpoint, ExoCross is a nice mix of both. Things such as surface transitions like going from asphalt to dirt and back again feel natural and require you to have that extra level of control to avoid a spin out. Hitting your drifts on turns is both challenging yet satisfying that will have you looking for more reasons to utilize your handbrake than not.</p>



<p>The game is designed to be played with both controller and wheel. Controller was the primary focus when developing, and it feels as smooth as you’d hope. Using a wheel, there are some tweaks that need to be done to get it just right. So, I’ll reserve an official opinion on how the wheel racing feels until launch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The world surrounding ExoCross can be breathtaking.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Visually, it’s stunning. From the vehicles to the tracks to the overall atmosphere, ExoCross looks phenomenal. There’s just something about racing with Saturn in the backdrop that feels breathtaking. It can also be distracting the first time around because you just want to soak it all in. It’s where having a replay suite would come in handy.</p>



<p>As a whole, ExoCross is a fun racing game on a really solid engine. The cars feel great while giving you enough of a quick to learn yet hard to master feel. The Championship mode, as well as other offline options, give you a nice entry point into the game’s tracks and vehicles, and allow you to really learn the ins and outs before taking to online racing. There’s such a fun game here that feels like the foundation for something bigger in the future.</p>



<p>Where my concern sits with ExoCross is mainly in the replay factor. It’s going to rely heavily on&nbsp; online multiplayer. However, there is no cross-platform play. There’s cross-generation between Xbox and PlayStation consoles, but they can’t play with each other. And if you’re on PC, well you only have the PC player base to compete against.</p>



<p>Obviously, we’ll have to wait and see what the reception to the game is and how many people pick it up before making a judgment on that front. But from what the game offers you on the track, it’s&nbsp;</p>



<p>ExoCross officially launches on July 23 for PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Insider Gaming’s full scored review of the game will come shortly after once multiplayer can be properly tested and the game’s full release with various bug fixes becomes available.</p>

			<p>The very best examples of the metroidvania form often take a ‘less is more’ approach to storytelling. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night doesn’t inundate you with lengthy exposition or drawn-out flashbacks, and even contemporary hits like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/13/hollow-knight-review/">Hollow Knight</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/27/momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight-review/">Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight</a> let their well-developed worlds do most of the talking. Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder has one of the most interesting worlds I’ve ever seen in a sprawling platformer adventure like this, but a constant focus on exposition-filled, unexciting dialogue tears all the intrigue out of the experience and left me wishing this game could have burned so much brighter than just a cinder.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GsLaTphHcY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I have to be real with you for a second: I am so sick of games opening with a bunch of illustrations and text boxes to explain the entire history of their world to you. When I’ve yet to see my protagonist or press a single button, it’s hard for me to care about or even remember the history textbook I’m being pop quizzed on. Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder does exactly this, outlining a history that began countless years ago when a Gate to the Abyss cracked open in the ground, leading hellspawn and demons to invade the world and drive humanity to near-extinction. Then humans used the power of the Abyss to create special armor, people wearing that armor fought and defeated the demons, and then the armour corrupted its wearers and the armour-wearing Akhaian warriors were led by The Betrayer to defeat humanity again. Then, one person in armor defeated the Betrayer, drove the Akhaians into exile, and the remaining human race built Canaan, the Steam City.</p>


<p>Anyway, Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder’s actual story kicks off countless generations after all of this and is barely about any of the events I described to you. Obviously it’s all a bit important, but it feels like putting the horse before the carriage to summarise all of these historic moments to the player instead of letting the immediate narrative and character interactions deliver bits of that info to me and draw me into this world more naturally.</p>


<p>Even more frustrating than the exposition-forward opening of the game is that a vast majority of the story that occurs afterwards barely involves your protagonist. Aletheia, the hero of this story, is a badass, beautiful crimson-haired bounty hunter who operates on her own terms and her own moral compass. She should be front and centre, but so much of the game’s opening acts instead focus on political conflict and intrigue playing out between other characters that feel far less exciting to be spending my time with.</p>
<p>When you’re given the reigns to guide Aletheia through city streets and winding dungeons, it’s a blast. Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder is rendered in gorgeous 32-bit style graphics, and the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night inspirations are immediately obvious. From the weight of your attacks and the precision of the platforming, to minute details like the after-image trail you leave behind as you dodge roll or the little pop-up in the corner of the screen when you pick up a new item. It’s an obvious homage, but there’s nothing wrong with that at all. Plus, I appreciate the modern touches blended in that make the game a little more distinct. Levelling up earns you points that you can use to unlock nodes on a skill tree – some nodes upgrade your sword or gun damage, while others will unlock new attacks or extend your basic combo.</p>

<p>Enemy design and placement is varied enough to keep you on your toes as you explore, but consistent enough that you’re quickly able to learn the best ways to rout each enemy and feel satisfied with your efficiency. Every enemy you fight has a health meter and a break meter, and while you can fire tesla bullets to quickly drain their break meter, you can only hold a few of those at any time. It leads to a really satisfying loop of dishing out sword attacks to build your ammo meter, then using your ammo to weaken your enemies, rinsing and then repeating.</p>
<p>The flow is a little less rewarding with boss battles, if only because those encounters tend to be a little too repetitive for their own good. Most bosses have limited move sets, slow movement, and a bit more health than you’d hope for. It leads to a lot of these fights dragging on just a bit longer than I would have liked.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there’s a really special world and atmosphere to Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder. I love the character designs and environment art, and a lot of the lore lurking at the corners of the story is genuinely fascinating. The drawn out and exposition-stuffed storytelling drains so much of the magic, though, and what’s left behind is a fun if not slightly repetitive metroidvania that’ll still please fans of the genre, but probably not wow them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/supraworld-early-access-release-planned-for-this-year.927405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supraworld-early-access-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supra Games has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>Early Access release is planned for sometime this fall, although the developer is hesitant to commit to a specific date or even a specific window right now.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1869290/view/6485829649605514602" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's Steam page</a>, Supra Games says that the current goal for&nbsp;<em>Supraworld</em>, which is a followup to 2019's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/supraland-review">shrunk-down 3D Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Supraland</em></a>, is to finish the first of its four acts "by the end of August".</p>
<p>Assuming that work is done and when the devs think "act 1 is solid", it'll be released in Early Access, which "might be in October", according to Supra Games. The dev does follow that announcement up with "we'll see", however, so it's far from set in stone.</p>

<p>The developer says the decision was made "for feedback and motivation reasons". If players are able to provide feedback during Early Access, it reminds developers "why [they're] actually doing this", and also gives people "a better time instead of working on something in isolation forever".</p>
<p>Additionally, there's a more mercenary and practical reason for launching in Early Access; Supra Games says it's been working on&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>for three years (presumably since the launch of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supraland-devs-call-dlc-terrible-business-model-announce-supraland-six-inches-under">standalone&nbsp;<em>Supraland</em>&nbsp;expansion&nbsp;<em>Six Inches Under</em></a>) and "production is expensive".</p>

<p>According to Supra Games, a lot of work has been done across acts two through four, but "it's just lots of loose bits" that haven't been properly connected yet. Hopefully, that means the full&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>release will come not too long after the Early Access launch.</p>
<p>At any rate,&nbsp;<em>Supraworld&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive in Early Access later this year. Stay tuned for more on this promising-looking project.</p>

            <p>Just shy of two years since the release of Two Point Campus, the Two Point Studios team has begun teasing its next project, suggesting an announcement is on the horizon.</p>
<p>A post on the <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-campus/blogs/74-operation-charter-archaeology-mystery">Two Point County site</a> shared a few days ago informed the community that Two Point's fictional and eccentric millionaire Wiggy Silverbottom was in need of some assistance.</p>
<p>"As you know, our beloved intrepid explorer is always on the lookout for his next adventure. So a few months ago, he assembled a team of newly graduated (so-called) experts in his field to embark on a top-secret and extremely important mission. There they made a remarkable discovery..." the site teased.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, there was a <em>slight</em> hiccup before this discovery reached its destination... the whole thing went missing! This caused quite a stir, as you'd imagine."</p>

<p>While the Two Point developer didn't specify precisely what this 'discovery' is, we know it to be some kind of artefact. And, it transpires that poor old Silverbottom is not alone in his predicament, as other artefacts have also gone astray.</p>
<p>The only clue as to their whereabouts was a "weird note" written in mysterious symbols (see below), which the community needed to decode. And thus began the first chapter of this story, which the Two Point team has named Operation: Charter.</p>
<p>Currently, fans have figured out the text translates to "Goons meet back at the lagoon" - though what this then means is as yet unclear. If you're keen to join the puzzle solving, you can head over to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/510054255416311808/1260936209014718534">Two Point Studio's Discord server</a> to pitch in.</p>
<p>The rest of the story will take the community "on a journey to investigate the mysterious heists" complete with puzzles, up until the developer is presumably ready to officially unveil its next game.</p>

<p>As for the studio's most recent title Two Point Campus (which released in 2022), we were rather taken with the whole thing.</p>
<p>"Just as it did with Two Point Hospital, Two Point Studios has combined neatly overlapping management systems with an irrepressably oddball charm," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">Eurogamer's Two Point Campus review</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1812835599369359753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, Ed Boon of NetherRealm Studios revealed the official gameplay trailer for Takeda Takahashi, who will join the Mortal Kombat 1 roster starting July 23, 2024.</p>



<p>Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1806792243044336115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first teased</a> Takeda weeks ago, who is also the final Kombat Pack 1 fighter.  Fans can play the character on July 23 with Early Access. Players can earn Early Access by purchasing the associated Kombat Pack or the Premium Edition for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Today’s gameplay trailer revealed some of Takeda’s moveset, dialogue, and a brutal fatality using their signature weapons.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Since Takeda will release on July 23 with Early Access, the full release should follow a week later. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-adding-homelander-ferra-kameo-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 added Homelander</a> to the roster in June 2024. Homelander followed that schedule, with an Early Access release on June 4 and a full release on June 11, 2024.</p>



<p>Fans will recognize Takeda Takahashi for appearing in Mortal Kombat X. Takeda will also be playable at EVO 2024.</p>



<p>Although the devs planned to release the Ferra kameo last month, the delayed kamo will finally release alongside Takeda next week.</p>



<p>Most recently, a new tease surfaced online suggesting that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-remaster-being-teased-by-studio-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat remaster</a> could be on the way. Eyeballistic CEO Joe Tresca encouraged fans to keep an eye on something related to the franchise with a screenshot.</p>
