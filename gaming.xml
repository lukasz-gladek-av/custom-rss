		<p>The Digital World and the real world are colliding once again in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, but with the world seemingly coming to an end, you’re thrown back in time to try and prevent the worst from coming to pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Digimon Story Time Stranger | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFEu9XOLmg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This latest entry in the Digimon Story series picks up with a snazzy intro anime for the ADAMAS agency, a group of somewhat ostentatiously dressed agents who’ve been galavanting around and trying to stop anomalous threats. It’s clear that this world has already been transformed by disasters, with a giant wall having been erected to hide a completely destroyed portion of the city, and now a military lockdown of the area that has the populace scared, confused and angry.</p>


<p>For you, there’s a path to sneak into, taking you underground to pass beneath the wall and discover what’s on the other side. As you do so, you encounter Digimon for the first time… or so it seems. ADAMAS has actually known of these creatures for a while, and can now grant you the ability to summon one, choosing between Demidevimon, Gomamon or Patamon as your partner Digimon through this opening.</p>
<p>What’s immediately apparent, as you battle through the opening areas, is the rather modern and freeing take on a turn-based JRPG. Enemies are visible in the open world, which gives you the chance to strike first or to try and avoid encounters entirely, but once you do end up in battle, you have a streamlined and effective combat system. Creatures go in turns, and you can have up to three active Digimon all slotting into the battle timeline based on speed stats. One nice element here is that using an item does not count as an action, and you can also swap Digimon in and out without foregoing a turn, which I feel will encourage using this feature during the run of the story. Elsewhere, you’ve got animation speed and auto-battling right in the main UI, which are great quality-of-life features.</p>


<p>You also have two categories to determine strengths and weaknesses in combat, with both the creature type and their elemental attacks giving you a deterministic readout of damage bonuses and buffs – whether it’s multiplied or reduced by 1.5x, 2x or both. At least, it will do so eventually, once you’ve learnt what works and what doesn’t against a new enemy.</p>
<p>You can boost these multipliers further with the Cross Arts, a techno-ability for your human character to use that builds up as you land attacks that can deal critical damage, and can then be set to buff your team or debuff and damage the opposition. it’s a fun cutscene animation, with your phone turning into a random gun-like contraption.</p>

<p>Oh, and then there’s adding creatures to your team, not by catching them, but rather by learning enough about them through combat to replicate them –&nbsp;able to do so from 100% learning, but then able to generate more powerful versions by waiting to 200%. As they gain experience, Digivolution comes into play, morphing them into more powerful forms, giving you clear paths to follow and letting you revert and choose alternate creature forms down the line. We only experienced this through the regular run of combat, but interacting with your Digimon to shape their personalities or nurturing them through a Digifarm are also options.</p>
<p>Many of these features were gradually revealed to us through the opening chapter, where the game throws mystery after mystery at you. A woman calls up ADAMAS and seems to know you, though you don’t know them in return, but whisks you along through devastated government buildings and with countless Digimon wandering around, some of immense power that you have to avoid, before building up to a final rooftop battle.</p>
<p>Let’s just say it doesn’t end too well and throws the narrative off in a temporal tangent!</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to a later portion of the game, we’re in the Abyss, and what could actually be a rather idyllic seaside part of the Digital World, were it not for the attacks being wrought upon this village by a group of Digimon known as Titans. You have to figure out a way to stop this from escalating and find that there’s already a personal connection that you can use to do so, as one of the Titans has switched sides.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, my knowledge of Digimon is much less deeply ingrained than Pokémon. I remember watching some of the early Digimon Adventure anime, and Agumon was obviously the posterchild back then – he still is, to be fair! – but I maybe underestimated just how out-there some of the Digimon designs could be. Deltamon has a signature ability to shoot like a Death Star, combining energy beams from both arm weapons and his mouth, or there’s Leomon, the humanoid lion with a knife which is a fellow with a giant gun for a body, and Aegiomon is literally just a human with goat legs, which feels less like a digital monster and more like something out of Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Through this section, the combat really starts to come into its own. The prologue had a lot of single hit battles (or even just some creatures getting KO’d by a preemptive attack), but heading down below the water to the Titan’s lair, thankfully with an invisible macguffin that means you can still breath alright, and the encounters here need more effort to learn and exploit weaknesses. Just as handy is how your party has ballooned in size, so you still have your team of three active Digimon to call upon, but there’s a bunch of story characters alongside.</p>

<p>The fight against the big Sharkmon boss of the Titans was a really satisfying one to work through, plugging away at his weaknesses and switching team members to put the best foot forward, using Cross Arts to debuff and damage them, and also then trying to target his head when he dips down to build up for a charge attack. It’s a good battle.</p>
<p>I feel that there’s a real opportunity for Digimon Story: Time Stranger to take advantage of. After some difficult times for Pokémon games, which are now shifting to a new real-time battle system, Digimon Story is sticking to the tried and true turn-based battles that could bring traditional monster battling fans to its yard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple months ago, my colleague and our Senior Content Manager Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow">played <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at Summer Game Fest</a> and enjoyed it. He's a longtime cheerleader of the <em>Digimon Story</em> franchise, but I never believed him enough to try it for myself.</p>

<p>After three hours with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at PAX West, I'm a believer now. It pretty quickly shot up to near the top of my October wishlist.</p>

<p>This demo session started off with what was essentially the beginning of the game, and I got a bit of setup for the overall plot and an easy onramp for the gameplay. Then, we transitioned to a later point in the story with level 20 Digimon.</p>



<h2>Digivolving to a Better Quality of Life</h2>

<p>The first major aspects I noticed with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> is just how many quality-of-life features there are. While I haven't played previous ones in the series, I know my way around a classic JRPG, and this one had a lot of lovely shortcuts.</p>

<p>We previously reported on some of them, like how you can auto-defeat wild encounters if your average level is stronger and still earn XP—even for 'mons in your storage. Combat animations can also be sped up by up to five-times speed.</p>

<p>I noticed a few new ones in my hands-on time at PAX, too. You can stand still in the overworld to automatically regenerate health and stamina. Your storage for all your Digimon can also be accessed anywhere in the overworld, making it easy to swap your 'mons out as needed.</p>

<p>"We don't need to do all the wasteful movements that people in past Digimon story titles had to go through," Producer Ryosuke Hara told me through a translator. "And trust me, we know there are people that have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review-digimon-are-champions" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyber Sleuth</em></a> and whatnot."</p>



<p>Battles are often determined by your understanding of type effectiveness, as you'd expect from a monster-taming game. I'm largely new to the franchise though, so learning the different attributes and elements felt like a lot to wrap my head around initially.</p>

<p>However, the combat UI makes it super easy to understand what's super effective and how strong (or weak) the multiplier will be. After all, this is a big monster-hunting turn-based RPG with hundreds of thousands of matchups to consider.</p>



<p>Overall, these quality-of-life improvements go a long way to making the game more convenient and streamlined, according Hara-san. He and the team iterated to find that perfect balance of ease without making it too easy. There's one big anchor that they used to balance this convenience against.</p>

<p>"In the end, we tried to balance it with the boss battles. We tried to make the boss battles more fun. We tried not to shake it up too much," Hara-san said through a translator. "Every boss battle is going to be appropriately hard for where you are in the story. That acts as the balancing in the game."</p>

<p>He assured us that while the boss battles ultimately serve as the skill checks, you likely will never be stuck in an impossible scenario. If your team isn't matching up well, you can always De-Digivolve and re-Digivolve your team to find new ways in.</p>



<h2>Digimon Gets Personal</h2>

<p>With the newly introduced Personality system, these conveniences feel like they'll go a long way to making <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> a good time. Depending on which Personality a Digimon has, their stats will grow a certain way.</p>

<p>This system works on two levels, I've noticed. On the surface, you can really shape a Digimon's character and feel more of an attachment to them. If you feel like your Agumon is the brave, heroic type, you can foster that by interacting with him and answering questions with brave responses. It helps you develop more of a personal bond.</p>

<p>On a deeper level, understanding their Personality type will help you optimize their stats, allowing you to amplify their strengths and cover up their weaknesses. This creates a deeper endgame for players who really want to go that extra mile and make a team of absolutely perfect Digimon--or hell, even make a perfect version of all 450+ Digimon in the game.</p>



<h2>So What's the Digimon Story?</h2>

<p>In this universe, there's a Digital World that coexists with reality, and there's an ongoing war between Digimon that could lead to a cataclysmic apocalypse in both. You're part of ADAMAS, an investigation team that's trying to stop the calamity.</p>

<p>The protagonist is a Tamer that collects and controls Digimon to fight rogue Digimon and other threats. In the second part of my play session, a character mentioned something called the "Shinjuku Inferno," which sounds related to (or could be) whatever bad thing we're trying to prevent.</p>

<p>The game doesn't really waste time getting conflicts into motion; the opening hour or so throws you into the thick of a protest that goes wrong, and it ultimately leads what feels like a major inciting incident.</p>



<p>With a 40–50 hour campaign, there will be a lot to sink our teeth into when <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> releases on Oct. 3. Personally, between the strong turn-based combat, quality-of-life upgrades, and intriguing apocalyptic story, I'm convinced I should've been a <em>Digimon Story</em> fan a long time ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another former Xbox staffer has added their voice to criticisms surrounding Xbox Game Pass and other gaming subscription services, and this time, it's ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis' turn to cast a critical eye over the service.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Loftis first admits that Game Pass "can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves", citing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">breakout platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">Human: Fall Flat</a>&nbsp;</em>as an example of this process in action.</p>

<p>However, Loftis goes on to say that "the majority of game adoption" on Xbox Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue", with the exception of games that are "engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=vkFBFQPw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=ADOraKxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not every Game Pass game can be&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, says ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis.</figcaption></figure><p>Loftis concludes by saying that she "could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates" among developers whose games will be appearing on Game Pass.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Loftis isn't the first former Xbox staffer to offer a colorful opinion on the Game Pass subscription service this month.</p>

<p>Her comments follow those of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ex-Bethesda exec Pete Hines</a>, who said last week that subscription services are "worth jack shit" without companies "figur[ing] out how to balance the needs of the service...with the people who are providing the content".</p>

<p>Indeed, Loftis' comment was posted in response to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawn-layden_former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-activity-7369880832481660928-HhnQ/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reposting Hines' comments</a> himself, adding that the question should not be whether subscription services are profitable for their owners, but whether they are "healthy and helpful" for devs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=MDF4q3v2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=R8iBpTLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, almost certainly won't be hurt by launching on Game Pass on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on Game Pass on day one doesn't necessarily preclude a game from achieving financial success. Games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow">recent&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster</a> debuted on Game Pass, but still seemingly managed to rack up very respectable sales for themselves.</p>

<p>Still, these execs' comments on Game Pass and other subscription services should give us pause for thought, especially when it comes to smaller indie devs (and even major first-party studios). Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-5tb-xbox-game-drive-costs-less-than-the-4tb-like-getting-1tb-free-3-year-rescue-included-2000623483</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-5tb-xbox-game-drive-costs-less-than-the-4tb-like-getting-1tb-free-3-year-rescue-included.1291506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game file sizes just keep growing bigger and bigger, but consoles struggle to keep up. Just look at the Xbox Series X|S. The more robust Series X has an internal SSD with storage totaling 1TB. With the Series S, you get about half that at 512GB. Not all of that is usable storage though as much of it is holding the system software needed for your Xbox to work in the first place. Then we have games come out like last year’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> with a file size in the triple digits. If you play more than three or four games, you’re going to be in a constant struggle of deleting and redownloading software as you bounce between games.</p>
<p>Luckily, their are external options. <strong>The Seagate Game Drive for Xbox comes with a crazy 5TB of storage</strong> to put all of your file size worries to bed.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/"> It normally goes for $150, but right now it’s 13% off which brings the price down to just $130.</a> You’ll save a good $20 (which just so happens to be exactly enough to hop into&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Gaming Ahead</h2>
<p>Ok so here’s the catch. This is an HDD, not an SSD. Hard disk drives are notably slower than solid state drives. So much so that the Seagate game drive is incapable of playing Xbox Series X|S games directly from it. You’ll have to move the game file from the HDD to your Xbox’s internal storage in order to play it—sort of the digital version of taking your game disc off the shelf and popping it into the console.</p>
<p>Transferring the files can be much faster than redownloading from Microsoft’s servers otherwise would be, especially if you live in an area with unreliable bandwidth.</p>



<p>The good news is that if you’re still playing a bunch of Xbox One, Xbox 360, or original Xbox titles, they can be loaded and played directly from the drive. The drive is also compatible with Xbox One and Xbox 360 directly if tho9se consoles still get regular action in your place.</p>
<p>The HDD is portable as well. You can have your games loaded onto it, then take it over to a friend’s house. Pop it into their Xbox and you’ll be able to load up or move over your games onto their console. The drive is simple plug and play making it pretty straight forward to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3958/">Right now, you can save $20 on the Seagate Game Drive for Xbox for a limited time. Get it for just $130.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PAX West has wrapped up this year, and our team on the ground spent the entire four-day weekend looking all the latest in gaming. From unexpected indies to eagerly anticipated titles, here's a roundup of all the cool games Editor in Chief Andrew Otton and Features Editor Robert Scarpinito saw in Seattle.</p>



<h2><em>Blocks for Babies</em></h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted to whip out a super shotgun to clear out some blocks in <em>Tetris</em>? Then <em>Blocks for Babies</em> is exactly what you're looking for. It blends <em>DOOM </em>with <em>Tetris </em>in more clever ways than you might think. Certain blocks can only be cleared in first-person gameplay, adding an extra layer of strategy while you're laying tiles.</p>

<p>Additionally, boss battles impact both gameplay modes. For example, the boss in the PAX demo moved like the old-school game <em>Snake </em>in <em>Tetris </em>mode, dropping specific blocks you have to clear quickly. Meanwhile, in first-person, you can shoot specific blocks in the snake to do more damage as the snake flies about.</p>

<p>You can find a demo for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2776770/Blocks_for_Babies/" rel="nofollow">(and add it to your wishlist) on Steam</a>.</p>



<h2><em>Unyielder</em></h2>

<p>This is the first of three games from Shueisha Games on this list, so strap in. <em>Unyielder </em>is all octane, no oxygen. This first-person shooter roguelike is all about quick reflexes, precise timing, and the rule of cool. You get power ups as you progress in a run, with basic ones like faster reload times and more interesting ones like the ability to infinitely reload a clip. Suddenly, that rocket launcher that loads one rocket at a time becomes an endless barrage of carnage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The secret to satisfaction here, though, is the parry system. It's one giant boss rush, and each boss has multiple attacks that can be countered. If you time your shots correctly, you'll interrupt the enemy and make them vulnerable to damage. There are five playable characters, but the one I tried had a grappling hook that I used to zip around the battlefield.</p>

<p>I'm instantly sold, and it's looking like it'll come out within the year. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/789940/UNYIELDER/" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.</p>



<h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>is the only AAA game on this list, solely because I didn't have enough time to finish the entire preview build. However, what I played was nothing short of refined and exciting. It continues the franchise's history of fast-paced, cutthroat action, and something that really caught my eye was the Bloodraven meter on the new extra-edgy protagonist Yakumo.</p>

<p>This meter can be tapped into by holding down a shoulder button, amplifying your damage and changing your combos. Unlike other action games, this isn't a one-time activation situation. It can be turned on or off at a whim as long as you have enough left, opening the door for some interesting strategies and—more importantly—sick-looking combos.</p>

<p>Throw in a dark, hyper-futuristic neo-Tokyo setting and I'll be there. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>will hit Xbox Game Pass along with PlayStation 5 on Oct. 21.</p>



<h2><em>Bakudo</em></h2>

<p>There's something so satisfying about a game that takes basic sports and cranks everything up to 11,000. <em>Bakudo </em>is still in early development by Sayil Games under Shueisha's publishing arm, and it's basically a sci-fi dodgeball boss rush. You play as a character who just entered Bakudo Academy, but there's a major conspiracy under it all.</p>

<p>The story and presentation give me <em>Kill La Kill</em> vibes, and the gameplay is merciless. Catching the enemy's ball requires you to read their movements and react quickly, and sometimes you'll need to curve the ball to get past their defenses. Certain attacks require you to parry instead of catching, opening the door for high-powered spikes if you can time it perfectly.</p>

<p><em>Bakudo </em>is equal parts charming and brutal, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275860/BAKUDO/" rel="nofollow">you can wishlist it on Steam</a>—just don't expect it to release within the next year.</p>



<h2><em>Cat Secretary</em></h2>

<p>Cats have been having a moment in video games, and Good Story Guild is looking to ride that wave with its upcoming game <em>Cat Secretary</em>. It leans more toward the playfulness of <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, but it also has a little bite with its silly yet scathing commentary on capitalism.</p>

<p>You work as a cute little business cat in a company where almost everyone has been replaced with AI robots. Naturally, they need someone to do things that only organic creatures can handle, like sorting files and making coffee, which you do during the day. By night, it seems like you'll be skulking around and helping a rat potentially sabotage the company? Honestly, I'm unsure, but I'm along for the ride.</p>

<p>If you want to get your paws on <em>Cat Secretary</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2783280/Cat_Secretary/" rel="nofollow">you can wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>



<h2><em>Arcane Eats</em></h2>

<p><em>Arcane Eats </em>takes a formula perfected by <em>Slay the Spire</em> and applies it to the culinary arts to fantastic results. There's a level of tongue-in-cheek humor here that makes everything feel light and breezy, and it's so mechanically sound that the rules of the game feel intuitive.</p>

<p>You have three burners to manage, and you can stack skillets of food on top of each other for a bigger "attack" against a customer's hunger. The longer they wait, though, the more mental damage they'll do to you, so you have to thread the needle between building up numbers and turn management.</p>

<p>This game is made by a small team in Seattle, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640090/Arcane_Eats/" rel="nofollow">you can wishlist it on Steam</a>. After all, don't you want to beat the first food-judge boss, Guy Fairy?</p>



<h2><em>OPUS: Prism Peaks</em></h2>

<p>Visual-novel (adjacent?) fans might recognize the previous game from Taiwanese developers SIGONO, called <em>OPUS: Echo of Starsong</em>. I remember it being well received by critics, so I wanted to see what the hype was about with the new project from SIGONO, which is being published by Shueisha.</p>

<p>The demo I played was roughly 20 minutes, and the caliber of storytelling here felt next level. The protagonist goes through a lot of ups and downs in that short time, immediately creating an complex character that left me wanting to learn more about him. And that doesn't even get into the sudden appearance of a cursed girl he's reluctantly helping.</p>

<p><em>OPUS: Prism Peak</em> is giving <em>Life Is Strange</em> vibes with its third-person light puzzle solving and a focus on narrative, and I'm <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947910/OPUS_Prism_Peak/" rel="nofollow">keeping an eye on its Steam page</a> as it gets closer to release.</p>



<h2>Rabbit Haul</h2>

<p>When I first heard about <em>Rabbit Haul</em>, it felt like the perfect mix of games made just for me. It's part farming sim, part tower defense, and you even have to restore a town as your "base" for upgrades. That's a trifecta that will get me more than interested immediately.</p>

<p>The overarching goal is to rebuild your hometown and you do so by growing crops on your farm to rebuild the town's economy and food reserves. The plants you grow all have different values and effects, which will come into effect when it turns to night.</p>

<p>At night, your farm is descended on by hungry raccoons hellbent and eating your food stores. Thankfully, you can fight back with weapons and the plants you grow will try to defend themselves as well.</p>

<p>It's an utterly charming game that was absolutely swarmed whenever I saw it at PAX West. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2514330/The_Rabbit_Haul/" rel="nofollow">Wishlist <em>Rabbit Haul </em>on Steam</a>, I bet you won't regret it if these are your types of games.</p>



<h2>No Stone Unturned</h2>

<p>In <em>No Stone Unturned</em> you set out to answer the age old question: Why did the chicken cross the road? You play the squirrel Detective Cox who is there to investigate the murder of said chicken found right next to the road.</p>

<p><em>No Stone Unturned</em> is a detective game with a quirky story with funny characters and a lot of mystery. There's the overarching case of the chicken, but there's more to learn about the town you'll find yourself in.</p>

<p>While gathering clues, you'll encounter all kinds of people and puzzles, as well as a bunch of classic mini-games that will remind you immediately of WarioWare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything I saw in the 20ish minute demo was clever and had more than a few chuckles in it. I love the way it looks, and I can't wait to sit down and soak it all in. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2453640/No_Stone_Unturned/" rel="nofollow">Check it out on Steam</a>.</p>



<h2>War of the Western Deep</h2>

<p><em>War of the Western Deep</em> is a classic adventure game set in the graphic novel series, <em>Beyond the Western Deep</em>. It caught my eye last year at PAX West, and I was excited to see it return this year.</p>

<p>You play as Mirren (voiced by Samantha Béart, who you may know as Karlach from <em>Baldur's Gate III</em>), a royal courier sent out to send an important letter by the king. Your peaceful kingdom of Sunsgrove is about to be invaded secretly by your neighbors, and you need to travel into soon-to-be enemy territory to deliver that letter.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll notice it is visually striking, with absolutely gorgeous artwork. What's even better is how it's all hand-animated artwork, which makes for a beautiful image on screen.</p>

<p>There's also some combat that really shows off the beautiful animations. Combat is very reminiscent of something like Punch-Out!!, where it's about timing attacks and dodges with your opponent while managing a stamina bar for your movements. The crisp, flowing animations make it a delight to take in.</p>

<p>I'm a sucker for narrative heavy games and this looks amazing, so I can't wait to immerse myself in the world of Western Deep. I've certainly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976440/War_of_the_Western_Deep/" rel="nofollow">got it on my Steam wishlist</a>.</p>



<h2>Nocturnal 2</h2>

<p><em>Nocturnal 2</em> is the game that made us turn our head the most and we knew we had to check it out. Look through the game in motion on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2847780/Nocturnal_2/" rel="nofollow">Steam page</a> trailer and the other screenshots, and you'll get a good reason why.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I had not heard or seen the first game, <em>Nocturnal</em>, which released in 2023. This is a sequel to that, and it looks to be a bigger and more beefed-up version of that game. The first was a sidescrolling action platformer, which the sequel also is but adds in some metroidvania elements on top.</p>

<p>It's obviously gorgeous to look at, but the combat has a decent amount going for it as well. It's more slow and deliberate, so don't go in thinking something like the speed of Dead Cells. Parrying and dodging out of the way to get your swings in is the key a lot of the times, as is knocking enemies into the air and slamming them into the ground. I didn't have a ton of time with the game, but I imagine juggling enemies and bouncing them off walls/the ground will play a big role into making big combos.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're looking for a new action platformer after, say, <em>Silksong</em>, keep an eye on <em>Nocturnal 2</em>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2847780/Nocturnal_2/" rel="nofollow">You can wishlist it here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-Nintendo Dev Says Nintendo Has "No Real Need" for New Franchises]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-nintendo-dev-new-franchises</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-nintendo-dev-says-nintendo-has-no-real-need-for-new-franchises.1291473/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're wondering why Nintendo hasn't come up with a brand new franchise in a little while, an ex-Nintendo developer may well have an answer for you: it doesn't really need to.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Ken Watanabe, a former Nintendo developer who's worked on games like&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>, says new Nintendo franchises haven't appeared "simply because there's no real need to make them".</p>

<p>Rather than creating new franchises, Watanabe says the Japanese gaming giant focuses on "gameplay mechanics first", and then "pick[s] whatever fits that new gameplay best" as a franchise "skin or...wrapper".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-new-franchises.jpg?itok=sCZpgHvL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-new-franchises.jpg?itok=bP9_rAZx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>arguably demonstrates Nintendo's design philosophy as described by ex-developer Ken Watanabe.</figcaption></figure><p>Watanabe says that Nintendo's focus is on "creating a new way to play", and that the studio will pick the franchise that it thinks most applies to that "new way".</p>

<p>I'd argue this design approach is evident in this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-oohh-banana" rel="nofollow">rather excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>; the "new way" Nintendo found this time was to create <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">a 3D platformer</a> full of destructible terrain, and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>best fit the idea of wanton destruction mixed with 3D platforming.</p>

<p>According to Watanabe, it's also common for Nintendo staffers to "secretly work on something without telling their boss", and if that idea is interesting, it "gets turned into a real product". He describes making a level in&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 3&nbsp;</em>in his spare time, only for Nintendo to include said level in the final product.</p>

<p>Artist and designer Takaya Imamura follows up by saying that Nintendo "lets [its staff] just focus on building what [they] believe to be fun, without distraction". That would go some way towards explaining the generally high standard of Nintendo's work.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-nintendo-new-franchises.jpg?itok=3u5Kf1p3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-nintendo-new-franchises.jpg?itok=K9zHtMsF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>arguably represents the last major Nintendo franchise to debut.</figcaption></figure><p>This philosophy is also presumably why the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Splatoon Raiders</a>&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>spinoff rather than a game belonging to an entirely new franchise, although exactly what shape the gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>will take remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In any case, it does look like Watanabe's idea of how Nintendo operates hasn't done the company any harm at all; the Switch 2 has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">sold very well indeed</a> thus far, so whatever Nintendo is doing, it's likely to continue into the near future, at the very least.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deus Ex Writer Says The Fact Elon Musk Loves It Is Its ‘Worst Legacy’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-favorite-game-deus-ex-conspiracy-2000624003</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deus-ex-writer-says-the-fact-elon-musk-loves-it-is-its-%E2%80%98worst-legacy%E2%80%99.1291470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Great fiction can’t fix bad people. That’s one takeaway from the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grimes-cyberpunk-elden-ring-twitter-1850858252">Elon Musk seems to love</a> the classic sci-fi immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em> despite it being a game precisely about how people like him are ruining the world. One of the game’s writers recently explained how that’s the worst part of its legacy.</p> <p>Released in 2000, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"><em>Deus Ex</em> follows</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985"> anti-terrorism operative JC Denton,</a> who uses his cybernetic enhancements to uncover the conspiratorial forces trying to take control of a world ravaged by social upheaval, economic collapse, and a plague. It’s both an investigation of how propaganda shapes society and what it means to be human, in addition to being a really clever stealth action game about hacking people’s private email.</p> <p>“That kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread between <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>,” Austin Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/deus-exs-influence-on-elon-musk-may-be-its-longest-worst-legacy-says-its-writer/">recently told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “It is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Musk’s worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.”</p>

 <p>Musk has repeatedly called <em>Deus Ex</em> one of his <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1321245225755512832">favorite games ever</a>. When the pandemic began in early 2020, he even described it as feeling <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1241104391706304512?">like something from the game’s plot</a>. Musk also happens to be one of the world’s richest people, on track to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-trillionaire.html">become the first trillionaire</a>, whose tech empire includes companies trying to implant devices <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1227850900/elon-musk-neuralink-implant-clinical-trial">directly into people’s brains</a>. Reading the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-at-20-the-oral-history-of-a-pivotal-pc-game">oral history of <em>Deus Ex</em>‘s creation</a>, there’s little doubt the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670"><em>Diablo</em> cheater</a> would have been considered <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-we-the-baddies">one of the baddies</a> in its world.</p> <p>“It’s bizarre that Elon Musk would not recognize where he actually sits in the<em> Deus Ex</em> universe, because it is not in the JC Denton role,” Grossman said. “Musk plainly imagines he’s the JC Denton of this world—a plainspoken everyman, standing up to the elite. As is obvious to everyone, Musk is the one with power and he’s just pathologically incapable of honest introspection.”</p> <p>He continued, “I would say Musk is like a<em> Deus Ex</em> villain, except that the franchise doesn’t have any villains as whiny and self-servingly delusional as he’s shown himself to be.”</p>

<p>Gotta trace those rays</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is out now on the Switch 2 (a fact you might have missed thanks to last week's furore around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>) and now the tech experts over at Digital Foundry have provided their analysis of the game's performance on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>Despite some concerns pre-launch, Outlaws is kind of a technical marvel, with Digital Foundry calling it "the most impressive Switch 2 port to date", noting that despite the console being weaker than its console siblings – including the Xbox Series S – advancements within the architecture mean that Outlaws is able to punch well above its weight.</p>
<p>Looking at image quality, DLSS allows Outlaws to output at 1440p when docked, with comparisons to the Series S more favourable than Digital Foundry has initially expected. Similarly, frame rate remains pretty consistent at 30fps throughout, though some menus actually push this up to 60fps. Cutscenes and pre-rendered videos sometimes drop a few frames here and there, but the gameplay is where it counts, and this is solid.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also highlights some solid use of ray-tracing, while also noting that volumetric lighting and fog has been decreased slightly when compared to other consoles.</p>
<p>In a rather curious comparison doing the rounds from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FactorofGames">Factor of Games</a> on YouTube, gameplay from the Switch 2 goes head-to-head with the Steam Deck. Context around exact performance parameters on the Steam Deck is missing, but otherwise the video demonstrates an obvious advantage for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Overall then, it seems Outlaws is a pretty solid benchmark for what can be achieved on the Switch 2, and it seems to be an even more impressive port than launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>. It's a good indication of what might be achieved in the future, should developers and publishers strive to put in the work and not cut corners. Fingers crossed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preview – Another Reason to Get a Switch 2]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pokemon-legends-z-preview-another-reason-to-get-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-%E2%80%93-another-reason-to-get-a-switch-2.1291434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember being fairly interested in what Game Freak was doing with its first stab at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em></a>. It was a whole new way to play with Pocket Monsters, but dodgy frame rates and a repetitive rhythm lulled me away from really enjoying it.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it had a certain quality that a lot of first tries have in this industry: it fell a little flat for me, but there was lots of potential for a sequel to really knock it out of the park. So I knew I had to try <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>while at PAX West.</p>

<p>The show floor demo was played on a Nintendo Switch 2, and it showcased two parts of the game: Battle Zones and a story encounter against a Mega Absol. After about 20 minutes with the game, I walked away from that demo excited for <em>Pokemon</em> like I was a kid waiting for <em>Pokemon Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl</em>&nbsp;again.</p>



<h2>Battle Zones Put the Focus on Trainers</h2>

<p>The first 10 minutes in the Battle Zone reminded me of a huge factor that I felt was missing from <em>Arceus</em>: trainer battles. Most of my memories with <em>Arceus </em>were roaming around wide open spaces, throwing balls at wild Pokemon with the occasional battle punctuated throughout.</p>

<p>In a Battle Zone, it's all about fighting opposing trainers. You can sneak up on their Pokemon by sending yours out from behind, giving you an advantage in the ensuing fight.</p>



<p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{773212e2-ce74-4f72-bc73-72ccdcf9ce45}{111}" paraid="115263152" xml:lang="EN-US">This time around, too, the old-school turn-based battles are no more. Everything is in real time now. You aim at an enemy while holding down a shoulder button, and all the face buttons are mapped to your Pokemon's abilities.</p>

<p>There were no agile or strong mode inputs from what I could see. Instead, each individual ability was on a cooldown, and as you'd expect, weaker attacks tend to cool down faster than others. I found myself settling into a rhythm of which attacks to rotate through, trying to minimize downtime as much as possible.</p>

<p>If you're in a poor matchup, you can quickly swap to another Pokemon by using the D-pad. It all felt seamless thanks to not having to pause the game, and the real-time menuing felt snappy and convenient.</p>



<h2>Living It Up in Lumiose City</h2>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> is set entirely in Lumiose City, the large city from <em>Pokemon X</em> and <em>Y</em>. When I first learned that, my immediate worry was performance. The Switch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/2017-was-magical-year-for-nintendo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as amazing as that system is</a>, was starting to feel its age in recent years.</p>

<p>Luckily, the demos for <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A </em>ran on the Switch 2, and all my fears disappeared. Running around the Battle Zone was smooth as butter, and it looked pretty good to boot.</p>

<p>As a city boy, I always love when a game brings an entire urban landscape to life, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-2-spider-man-1-furious" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">like the&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man </em>games</a>. So I'm excited to see Pokemon's take on it, especially with the power of the Switch 2.</p>



<p>The final leg of the demo involved a boss fight with a rogue Mega Absol, which was provided a bit of story context. It seems there's some mysterious reason these random Mega Evolutions are happening, and in true Pokemon fashion, you're randomly roped into stopping them.</p>

<p>In the demo I played, the protagonist didn't have a Mega Ring at first, so this Mega Absol could be one of the early ones we'll run into in the full game.</p>



<p>The fight itself felt a bit like the bosses in <em>Arceus</em>, where the trainer themself has to dodge a bunch of attacks. However, this time around, instead of throwing weird items at them, you're ordering your Pokemon to do attacks.</p>

<p>An extra layer of strategy I enjoyed is that my Lucario had Protect mapped as one of its abilities. Using it at just the right time so it didn't take damage from a large area-of-effect attack felt so satisfying, in a way I wouldn't expect from a Pokemon game.</p>

<p>Overall, the boss fight wasn't difficult, but there were just enough plates spinning that it remained engaging throughout, which is more than I can say for my experience with some games in the franchise's past. Hopefully that momentum remains in the full release.</p>



<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> Preview – Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Pokemon is a franchise I've learned to temper my expectations with. The level of fun I had with it as a kid probably won't match whatever I'm looking for as an adult. However, <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em> could be the game that makes me second guess that lesson.</p>

<p>I had so much fun with the little time I spent with it, and it instantly became something I'm looking forward to playing on my Switch 2. I hope the story remains interesting the long-term, but even if not, roaming around Lumiose City holds a lot of promise for me.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/battle-of-hoth-review-ice-cold-fun</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-of-hoth-review-ice-cold-fun.1291431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AT-AT's stomp on the hard-packed ice of Hoth, shaking the ground and rattling the hidden bunkers underneath. Meanwhile, hordes of brave Rebel soldiers burst from the snow, sending torrents of well-aimed blaster fire. Does the fate of the galaxy hinge on this pivotal battle? It does when you and your friends pick up a copy of&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>, a new strategic board game from Days of Wonder. Asmodee USA sent me a copy to check out, so let's fire up our snow-speeders and jump right in.</p>

<h2>What Is&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Battle of Hoth</em>&nbsp;is a strategic skirmish board game for two players (with a team-mode to allow for three to four players), with one player taking on the role of the Rebel Alliance and the other taking on the Imperial army. The objective of the game is (usually, though there are many different scenarios to play through) being the first to claim a set amount of victory medals by meeting a specific scenario's victory conditions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-board.jpg?itok=Q6-GASz3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-board.jpg?itok=byl1tAD0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To do so, you'll assign orders to your forces around the board, roll dice to attack, and attempt to out-pace and out-think your opponent in this quick strategic game. Each scenario instructs players on how to set up the board, placing their units onto the battlefield as well as terrain hexes that alter the environment.</p>

<h2>Activating Activations</h2>

<p>I really like the way activating units is handled in this game. Instead of issuing order tokens, or secretly selecting units from your battlefield, you'll play a Command card from a hidden hand you draw. And the command cards (except for special leader cards) break up the battlefield into thirds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-command-card.jpg?itok=IsloiLGK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-command-card.jpg?itok=vruOD9mj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In this example, the Rebel player has played the command card seen on the board, meaning they can activate two units in the left shaded quadrant.</figcaption></figure><p>Your Command card may say you can activate two units in the middle of the board, or one on each of the left and ride sides of the board, or some other combination. I find this approach to the game extremely engaging, as I have to both work with what I've got on the board&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;decide which of my Command cards to use, and which to save.</p>

<h2>A Fast-Paced Blast</h2>

<p>One of the first things that caught my attention with&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>&nbsp;is how little time it takes to actually set up the game and get rolling. Before I even opened the box, I admit I was expecting some hulking behemoth full of cards, rulebooks, miniatures, and tokens galore. But that's not the case with&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth</em>, with only a slim rulebook, a straight-to-the-action scenario book, 19 double-sided terrain hexes, 6 attack die, and miniatures for each side (the Rebels get 35 minis, and the Imperials get 39).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-rebel-minis.jpg?itok=Vaf846dt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-rebel-minis.jpg?itok=rzpKtTWr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The three types of Rebel miniatures included in the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the game, I was equally surprised at how nicely it moved along. You move your units, roll dice to attack, and before you know it you're scoring hits, removing enemy units, and getting closer and closer to your goal of four victory points (or more or less, depending on scenario).</p>

<p>You achieve these victory medals by completely eliminating an enemy unit (though some scenarios may offer extra or different ways to achieve victory medals).</p>

<p>So what this creates is a truly feeling of chaotic warfare on the battlefield, with snow-speeders zooming around, AT-AT's lumbering through the battlefield, and hordes of little dudes running around trying to pick each other off. Aside from some of the more complicated scenarios, you'll be done a standard scenario within 35-45 minutes. That's fast for a strategy wargame!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-imperial-minis.jpg?itok=RRq71tI7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-imperial-minis.jpg?itok=n_QD63Cz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The three types of Imperial Miniatures available in the game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Deeper Than It Seems</h2>

<p>I'm doing a lot of praising the game's speed and simplicity, but it certainly is deeper than it seems. As I mentioned above, the Command card activations are a fun and engaging way to mobilize troops. Add to that the ability to slightly customize your deck by choosing a commander, and it's almost like a mini-game within the game.</p>

<p>The dice-resolution is great fun on this too, with custom symbols on the dice representing a soldier silhouette, a mechanical gear, and a starburst. To hit your opponent's unit, you have to get the proper symbols. Starbursts hit everything, but the other two symbols matter: you can only hit troops with a soldier silhouette and snow speeders and AT-AT's with the gear (probe droids and rebel artillery can&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;be hit with the starbursts).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-hoth-dice-roll.jpg?itok=TnM6ZC7a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-hoth-dice-roll.jpg?itok=xB5nQv1U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In this scenario, the Rebel player has rolled their three dice to attack the Imperial Unit. The blue symbol and the yellow starburst are both hits, so two Imperial minis would be removed from this unit.</figcaption></figure><p>And then there's the Scenario Book, which contains 18 different scenarios to play through - from a first assault on an Imperial Scouting mission to defending the shield generators, medevac'ing important officers out of the field, and a final mass showdown called "Assault on Hoth," there's just so much game in here.</p>

<h2><em>Battle of Hoth -&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>You don't have to be a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;fan to find a lot to love in&nbsp;<em>Battle of Hoth -&nbsp;</em>though I assume many <em>will</em>&nbsp;with its focus on the classic&nbsp;<em>Empire</em>&nbsp;set piece. With its fast-paced gameplay and pick-up-and-play rules, this might be one of the cleanest introductions to strategy wargaming I've ever played. Using simple, intuitive dice-roll mechanics, easy unit movement rules, and few other "Yes... but!" clauses that can clog up the gameplay, what we get is a clean, well-oiled machine of a strategy skirmish game that prioritizes player fun over fussiness.</p>

              <p>How old is the TV in your living room? Is it absent of any smart features and streaming apps? Or maybe it is a smart TV, but you’re just not a fan of that particular manufacturer’s user interface (I’m looking at you LG with your wannabe Wiimote motion controls). You don’t need to be locked down to whatever your TV was capable of just out of the box. Pick up a Roku streaming stick for basically nothing and now you’ve got an intuitive, reliable way to stream content and navigate the apps. Usually, you can find<strong> the 2025 Roku Streaming Stick Plus with 4K and HDR support</strong> for $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">However, right now Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing its price down by 27% to just $29.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Jump Right In</h2>
<p>With a Roku streaming stick, you’ll have access to tons of different apps like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max (or whatever they’re deciding to call it this week). Customize the home screen to your preferences, putting the apps you use most frequently front and center. You’ll even be able to watch a good handful of Roku originals at absolutely no added cost. The service has shows like <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>,&nbsp;<em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>,&nbsp;<em>Martha Cooks</em>,&nbsp;<em>Emeril Cooks</em><em>,&nbsp;</em>and I’m sure a bunch of other stuff that aren’t cooking shows.</p>



<p>This streaming stick from Roku is capable of streaming content in 4K resolution and in HDR, so you won’t be sacrificing any image quality by making the jump from your 4K HDR TV’s interface to the more user-friendly Roku Plus. The streaming stick can even by synced up with your TV so it automatically turns on and off with one press. You can even control volume and navigate your Roku all with just the one remote. It even has a voice buttons which makes searching for your favorite TV shows or movies even easier. Just hold the button, say, “<em>My Cousin Vinny</em>,” and the next thing you know, you’ll be watching Marisa Tomei bang her foot on the ground as her biological clock ticks <em>like this</em>.</p>
<p>The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is designed to be unobtrusive. It’s compact form factor doesn’t block any other neighboring HDMI inputs. It’s powered by USB-A so you can just plug that end of it right back into your TV to run it. The whole thing will stay out of sight and you’ll avoid and extra cable running out, adding to the clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3957/">Right now, you can grab the Roku Streaming Stick Plus for nearly 30% off for a limited time.</a></p>

It should be expected that Borderlands 4 is “unplayable” if you’re trying to use a PC below min-spec, he said, and, generally, playing new AAA games on older hardware won't achieve impressive results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the comment in full:</p><blockquote>The Day 1 patch does a lot! That said, the expectation for using a below min-spec machine should be that the game is unplayable. That the game runs at all on your system is a miracle. That you can get 55 - 60 fps out of heavy combat is actually incredible given how the engine and what's going on under the hood. Your specification doesn't indicate if you're on SDD or HDD, but that could also explain some of the hitching. It's a big, bold, new, seamless world and I'm sorry to say that older hardware may not provide buttery smooth performance for the latest gen AAA games, as has always been the case since the dawn of PC gaming.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A significant portion of the PC gaming audience play on low-end hardware.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although the excellent Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the first taste of a JRPG not developed by a Japanese studio for many, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is hardly the first JRPG developed by a French team. Years ago, Midgar Studio released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/edge-of-eternity/">Edge of Eternity</a>, a solid open-world JRPG inspired by series like Final Fantasy and Xenogears, combining a vast world with a strategic turn-based combat system that made the experience rather remarkable, even with some of its issues. Years after work on the game has been completed, Midgar Studio is set to continue their franchise with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/edge-of-memories/">Edge of Memories</a>, a very different game than its predecessor but one that fans of certain types of action role-playing games will want to keep their eyes on.</p>



<p>During this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a>, I had the chance to briefly try out the game while speaking with Jérémy Zeler-Maury, Midgar Studio founder and CEO, who showed the same passion he did when I met him back in 2016 for an early look at Edge of Eternity. As soon as I picked up the controller to explore a world ravaged by a mysterious plague known as the Corrosion in the role of the Soul Whisperer Eline, I couldn't help but notice the extreme similarities the game developed by Midgar Studio has with last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/">Visions of Mana</a>. According to the Midgar Studio CEO, I wasn't the only one to do so, as, when Square Enix revealed the new entry in the Mana series, many told him they thought it was Edge of Memories that had been revealed. While these similarities are inevitably going to impact the game's reception, and wrongly, as Edge of Memories has been in development long before Visions of Mana got announced, the uncertain future of the Square Enix series could definitely benefit the game, as, aside from a similar, colorful art direction, the Midgar Studio title definitely seems more involving, especially in combat.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Edge of Memories looks a lot like Visions of Mana, but don't let appearances deceive you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While my time with Edge of Memories was short, the demo did an excellent job highlighting some exploration and traversal mechanics, which require players to use the proper elemental powers to open up the way, and some light platforming segments that often take advantage of these mechanics. What was really striking besides the implementation of these mechanics was the nice sense of scale the world, and the fact that I was able to get to any location which looked interesting enough from a distance, although, given the short time and the focused demo, this may not be a thing in the final release.</p>



<p>It's in the combat mechanics, however, that Edge of Memories sets itself apart more from Visions of Mana. Fighting enemies in the Midgar Studio game is considerably more involving, with multiple combo strings, skills sets that can be switched on the fly, and a general more action-oriented feel which aims to recreate the feel of NieR Automata, as Jeremy pointed out as I was trying to take down a boss with multiple targets launching area of effect attacks whose range was highlighted by red circles on the ground, in the vein of modern Mana series games. Not having had a lot of time to delve into these systems, I cannot say if Edge of Memories will feature the same combo freedom as the PlatinumGames-developed title, but controlling Eline felt smooth enough to make combat enjoyable even with minimal knowledge of the game's intricacies.</p>



<p>With Nacon publishing the game after acquiring Midgar Studio in 2022, Edge of Memories won't have to go through an Early Access period when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. I hope the game will launch sooner rather than later, as I am excited to see what else it will have to offer, and if it will be as good as the short Gamescom demo suggested.</p>

              <p>Nintendo’s war against modders and ROM distributors has seen some brutal takedowns over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">dishing out extraordinary punishments</a> against those who make it possible for people to pirate Nintendo games. The latest to fall afoul of the Japanese behemoth is Ryan Daly, who for the longest time looked like he was attempting an incredibly optimistic and clearly naive attempt to fight back. That’s over now as the MIG switch modder has settled for $2 million and an agreement to never touch a mod again in his life.</p> <p>Ryan “Homebrew Homie” Daly had run Modded Hardware, a site that sold modded Switches able to install homebrew or pirated versions of Switch games, and sold the tools with which others could do the same. Nintendo also claimed the site would return Switches with pirated games pre-installed. Back in March 2024, Nintendo threatened to sue Daly over the site, and the two parties agreed that Daly would stop his naughty behavior and the whole thing would go away. Daly said he would, then absolutely didn’t. So in June, Nintendo went to court.</p> <p>Daly continued to make surprising choices. Rather than rush to settle, the entrepreneur instead opted to respond to the complaint denying all wrongdoing, and even more wildly, did this without the advice of any lawyers. He even denied being responsible for the Modded Hardware business.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000623987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623987">© Modded Hardware / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TorrentFreak</em></a>, Daly’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/daly-response.pdf">response</a> wasn’t exactly stunning legal work. He essentially quoted the accusations and wrote “ANSWER: Denied” underneath them. However, despite all the denials of having done the things, Daly added “affirmative defenses” of the very things he was saying he didn’t do, defenses which included fair use and even accusing Nintendo of a “lack of unclean hands,” a legal doctrine that suggests Nintendo had acted unethically or dishonestly.</p> <p>Well, surprisingly enough this didn’t work out so well. This weekend the Seattle District Court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725/gov.uscourts.wawd.336725.30.0.pdf">released the details of a settlement</a>, in which Daly agrees to pay Nintendo $2 million, as well as hand over the URL of his site, and even agrees to the seizure of all his technology that might contain the means to infringe the agreement. It also comes with the most astonishingly strict list of requirements based on what Daly is and isn’t allowed to do for the rest of his life, which goes on for pages and pretty much amounts to never touching another MIG switch or modding tool so long as he lives.</p> <p>Whether Daly can afford to pay the $2 million is largely irrelevant to Nintendo. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">gleefully bankrupted Gary Bowser</a> over his association with a ROM-selling site in 2021, with a $10 million ruling the man will never be able to pay off, along with a gruesome 40-month prison sentence.</p>

              <p>It’s always frustrating when your phone dies in the middle of the day when you need it. From trying to order a ride to checking emails or just browsing something to pass the time, running low on battery can spoil it all. If you’d rather never have to go through that again, the solution is simple: grab a decent power bank.</p>
<p>But hold up — not all of these are worth your money. Some charge like they’re trying to break records, some suck their batteries dry too fast, and most are just too bulky to lug around. That’s where Anker enters the scene with a 10,000mAh model that’s our absolute favorite: And <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/">now that Amazon sells it for just $19, reduced from its original price of $26, there’s never been a better time to grab one and add it to your day kit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3966/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Fav Power Bank</h2>
<p><strong>Anker PowerCore 10K has a 10,000mAh capacity</strong> which is more than enough to charge <strong>most smartphones two or three times from one recharge</strong>. That’s to say you can go out all day without needing to worry about keeping your phone charged. It also works with tablets such as an iPad, so it’s not just on your phone. As <strong>airplane-friendly as well</strong>, you can even leave it in your carry-on bag without worrying about restrictions.</p>
<p>With Anker’s PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology, <strong>it charges up to 5V/3A</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not waiting around for hours just to have your phone return to a decent battery level. That means charging for the briefest moment can provide you with a genuine boost, something that’s handy if you’re in transit with not much stopping time to refuel. And with<strong> both USB-C in and out and a traditional USB-A port</strong>, it supports both newer and older cables and gives you flexibility regardless of the daily device you’re working with.</p>



<p>With a size about the width of a smartphone, it easily fits into a pocket, small purse or backpack without adding bulk. You won’t wince lugging it around like with some of those other larger battery packs that are brick-like. It still packs enough juice in it to keep you powered up without sacrificing size, which is the reason so many swear by it for daily use and travel.</p>
<p><span>This deal feels like one of those no-brainers that should be grabbed before it disappears: You’re essentially getting travel-ready security for your phone or tablet at a price lower than most cases, and it’s backed by one of the most trusted names in charging.</span></p>
