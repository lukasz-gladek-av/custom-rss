            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-black-myth-wukong-dnc-content-creators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why can’t people just play a game, say it’s fine, and move on anymore? Why does everything – whether it’s a finite single-player experience like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> or a <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stab at live-service immortality</a> like <em>Helldivers 2</em> – <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devolve into a numbers-driven culture war battleground</a>? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about how fandom has skewed people’s understanding of why we engage with works in the first place.</p><p>Before we get to that, though, we’re joined by Wired’s Makena Kelly to discuss <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-influencer-convention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creators at the Democratic National Convention</a> (a topic I’ll be covering in more depth next week). Was it a savvy move on Democrats’ part to give them press access? Did they do a better job of shining light on protesters and their causes than traditional press? And what was the deal with all the rumblings of conflict between creators and journalists?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, a Chinese action-RPG that’s taken Steam by storm, but not without its fair share of controversy. After much ado about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexist undercurrents</a> at the studio that made it and <a href="https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streaming restrictions</a> that asked content creators not to talk about “feminist propaganda,” the game is, like so many others at the heart of endless culture wars… fine. Then we wrap up by figuring out popular video game characters’ political affiliations (Sonic is an anarchist, Mario is center-right, and Zelda has probably overseen at least a handful of drone bombings).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can grow large enough that somebody will one day wage a culture war over <em>our </em>concurrent player count.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The reason why people care so much about concurrent players – even though it makes no sense in the context of a single-player game – is because it’s one of the few metrics people can point to and say “Look, we’re winning the culture war. Here’s a number that says we’re winning. Number goes up or number goes down, and – you can do this in either direction, since numbers are never entirely steady – you can say “Ah, our side is winning.”</p><p>I’ve seen this a lot with smaller games that come from indie developers – that are focused on more diverse casts and things like that. There’s the new game from Red Thread, the company headed up by Ragnar Tornquist, who made <em>Longest Journey</em> back in the day. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/721180/Dustborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dustborn</em></a>, is what it’s called. It has a diverse cast and tries to deal with a lot of serious issues. But it hasn’t performed that well on Steam, so people are saying “Nobody wants these games. They’re doing badly. They’re made by bad people. This validates our stance in the culture war.” Even though single-player games that are made by relatively small teams are not gonna attract millions of players or hundreds of thousands of players – and in fact can sell slowly over time and recoup their costs. It’s a different scale of production.&nbsp;</p><p>But it doesn’t matter to any of these people. They’re all using the same standard of judgment and saying that if you’re not hitting massive triple-A numbers or live service numbers, then you’re nothing, and that proves that you don’t matter, nobody cares, and actually every game should be the same game about the same white guy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Bleeding Cool or Comic Book Resource or whatever don’t need to be reporting on box office numbers while a movie is only three days old or rating single episodes of a TV series while it’s still running. It’s a series that’s got an overarching story to tell. We don’t need to be breaking everything down into numbers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did actually calculate the gross for an internship once. That was my job. I worked at ThinkFilm for a minute in film school, and they were like “Here are all the ticket stubs. Here are all the takes from these things.” In retrospect, I don’t think I should have been doing that. I think that’s not something you want to trust your intern to do.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Well that’s part of why [I said what I said earlier]. I’m definitely guilty of having done this in the past. We all would be to some degree. The need to constantly be posting and providing fresh stories and fresh SEO hits for a modern media website has you looking at those numbers and thinking they’re news.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> For multiplayer games, they’re also germane. With <a href="https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Team Fortress</em> thing</a>, I think it’s important to be like “How many people here are bots?”</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Yeah, because a multiplayer game is reliant on the size of the player base to an extent.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Even then, though, that can be germane, but you’ve gotta contextualize it, and you’ve really gotta work to do that, because people will look at a game like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and say it’s a failure because of bad updates. Meanwhile, it still gets up to 50,000 concurrent players sometimes. That’s more players than most games!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s made its money. They’re good for a very long time. I will say for me, though, there’s this element of, every time I see somebody who gets that way about box office stuff, I’m like “Do you own stock? Are you a shareholder?” Because if not, I don’t see why you fucking care.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Did you like the movie or not, man? That’s all that should matter to you.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> If you do [own stock], I get it. If you put all your money into Tencent, and you want to be like “Oh, the numbers,” then sure.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s a byproduct of the fact that people in many ways feel powerless to express themselves and their values beyond consumption. And so they’re like “I’m gonna be the ultimate consumer. I’m gonna show that the things I consume are more right and just than the things other people consume, and that bears itself out in the number of people consuming them. If my thing is more popular, then my views are better and more popular. I’m the best and the most normal.”</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I just thought of the term “emotional shareholder” for fandom. Just somebody who is like “I gotta sell this franchise. The movie’s bad. I gotta sell!” Or they’re like “Alright, what am I buying? I’m buying <em>Deadpool 3</em>. Alright, cool.”&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When you think of mobile games, it’s hard not to picture your grandma playing 500 levels of <em>Candy Crush </em>or a virtual gambling simulator disguised as a pretty anime character collector. There are plenty of gems that break outside of those molds, though, and developer KIWIWALKS has been pumping them out for nearly 10 years now in the form of the <em>WitchSpring </em>series. What started as a cute, character-driven RPG series that lived on your phone has recently grown into a proper console game franchise. <em>WitchSpring3 Re:Fine </em>saw releases on Steam and the Nintendo Switch, and just last year a full remake of the very first game in the series dropped on Steam. That remake, <em>WitchSpring R, </em>is finally coming to consoles, and now even more people have an opportunity to experience one of the most charming RPGs I’ve ever played.</p>
<p><iframe title="WitchSpring R - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAQHNXqfGmU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I hesitate to call <em>WitchSpring R </em>a JRPG, since it’s origins as a Korean-developed game leave it technically lacking in the J department. Despite that, though, the spirit and style of the game channels so much iconic JRPG energy. In particular, as a massive fan of the chill alchemy-focused <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/"><em>Atelier </em></a>series, I felt right at home diving into the adventures of bunny-eared witch Pieberry and her talking bird companion who goes by the unfortunate name of Black Joe.</p>


<p>Typically content with a life of solitude in her magic forest, Pieberry gains a newfound goal of discovery when she tastes her namesake for the first time – human-baked pie. So, on top of her usual routine of foraging for materials and fending off monsters and witch-hating humans, she sets out to explore the world beyond her home and see what other human inventions she can experience that are as good as pie.</p>
<p>I love a game with low-stakes, and <em>WitchSpring R </em>plays into that so perfectly. At first, the stakes are arguably a bit too low – it takes a while for the game’s writing to break out of the rhythm of just feeling like it’s dialogue purely for the purpose of gameplay tutorializing. That slow start eventually gives way to a rhythm and routine that helped the narrative really fall into place for me, though. Without an immediate end-of-the-world plot being thrust on me, the smaller encounters that make up most of <em>WitchSpring R’</em>s story helped give a lot more grounded charm to all the characters that got introduced along the way.</p>


<p>It helps that the gameplay in <em>WitchSpring R </em>is not only varied, but fun enough that it feels all to natural to fall into the gameplay loop routine of it all. Combat in the game isn’t triggered by any random encounters – you can see enemies on the field and choose when, or if, you want to engage them. It makes battles feel like a calculated choice alongside your routine of harvesting materials, or doing minigames to raise Pieberry’s various stats in the Growth menu. Battles are pretty simple turn-based encounters, with Pieberry being able to dish out standard attacks or various Magical Slab abilities while Black Joe can hop in to provide items and potions in a pinch.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game you’ll recruit characters who can expand your party, but you also get to capture a huge variety of monsters and make them part of your party, too. In a standard playthrough, the combat in <em>WitchSpring R </em>will be more about party customization and stat growth than dense strategy – but new game+, higher difficulty options, and bonus bosses give you lots of opportunities to push your battle prowess to the limits if you so choose.</p>

<p>The 30 or so hour runtime of <em>WitchSpring R </em>flew by in a flash for me. It’s a gorgeous game full of beautiful character art, whimsical music, and a lighthearted story that dishes out all my favorite, comfortable JRPG tropes. If you’re looking for a high-stakes adventure with grim narrative consequences, this won’t pass the sniff test for you. But if you’re in the market for a comfortable, cute RPG experience, <em>WitchSpring R </em>is a must-play.</p>

			<p>As promised on the roadmap to launch, BioWare has just <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a new blog post that included a series of attached gameplay videos showing off the combat system of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The footage is grabbed from the point of view of a Warrior player character who chose the Champion specialization, which is designed around defense and fire damage (which is great against Darkspawn, who are vulnerable to fire). As previously outlined by the studio, players will have to pick three abilities plus an Ultimate attack, the latter of which depends on the class specialization, to bring into battle. In this case, the player chose Driving Kick, Grappling Spear, Spectral Bulwark, and Warden's Fire.</p>
<p>We also get a first look at Runes, which complement active abilities. The three Runes picked in this case were Mend, which consumes all Rage to heal Rook when activated; Crystallize, which freezes all enemies in a radius of 10 meters around the player character; and Diminish, which weakens all enemies within 6 meters. Another Rune highlighted in the video is Scorch, which changes all weapon attacks to deal Fire damage for 20 seconds. Overall, Runes provide additional control, utility, and damage boost.</p>
<p>This Rook also uses full Heavy Armor, which gives them access to the related Mastery that boosts defense by 20% and reduces the chance of being disrupted upon receiving a hit. Another major passive in the skill tree is Fiery Resolve, granting Flaming Weapons upon successfully parrying an attack. The video then switches to the equipment section, showing gear that improves Stagger, leading to easier takedowns. The Stagger meter is shown as a lavender bar, whereas the Armor Barrier is a yellow bar, and it is reduced most easily with heavy melee attacks. On the other hand, ranged attacks remove the Shield Barrier (colored in blue).</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | High-Level Combat Parts 1-4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2UEqn38s9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be played best when synergizing strategies with Rook's companions. For example, in the mission shown in the video, Lucanis' Adrenaline Rush boosts Rook's damage, whereas Davrin's Heroic Strike applies the Overwhelmed debuff, increasing the Stagger taken by the target. Companions can also help with crowd control, as shown with Lucanis' Abominate, an ability that knocks down foes in the target area. Arguably, their greater use is with combos, though. After asking Davrin to taunt nearby foes and pulling a far one with Grappling Spear, Rook enables the Crystallize rune to freeze them, opening them up for Lucanis' Eviscerate combo detonation.</p>
<p>All this rests on top of the combat basics: jump, light attack, heavy attack, and dodge, the latter of which is available even in the middle of an attack. Both light attacks and heavy attacks can be charged down to hit enemies harder, and some attacks are triggered contextually upon jumping or sprinting at an enemy. Each class has ranged attacks (the Warrior Champion has shield throw, Captain America style), blocks and/or parries, and two distinct weapon sets to swap during fights.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Preview: Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-purest-evolution-of-a-stellar-rpg.963141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2014, Warhorse Studios published a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of Kingdom Come Deliverance. In a few months, the campaign had been completed more than three times over, and in 2018, one of the most realistic open-world RPG titles emerged to an overwhelmingly positive reception.</p>



<p>Now, the team is shaping up to release Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a direct continuation of the first game and an evolution in every sense of the word. I recently got hands-on with KCD2 at Gamescom, enjoying a solid chunk of the game reserved exclusively for press participants.</p>



<p>This is my preview – enjoy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-flawless-execution">Flawless Execution</h2>



<p>To give a little context, my preview of KCD2 was set ‘around 50 hours’ into the game, with a strong and determined Henry of Skalitz facing down a local swordmaster and then taking part in a few events that unravelled after that duel took place. I had an opportunity to explore Kuttenberg, one of two super-sized cities in KCDII, and try out many of the game’s core mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stealth</li>



<li>Open Combat</li>



<li>Lockpicking</li>



<li>Dialogue</li>



<li>Tournaments</li>



<li>Bartering</li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve logged a couple of hundred hours in Kingdom Come Deliverance and would consider myself a huge fan. It was just a few weeks ago that I had the opportunity to interview Tom McKay, who plays Henry of Skalitz, the series’ protagonist.</p>



<p>When I stepped into KCDII, I was blown away to learn how much of an improvement it was over the first game. The team at Warhorse Studios has managed to do something remarkable, as KCDII has evolved immeasurably but retained the core concept and feel of the first game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VP6bjlger8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Graphically, KCDII is nothing short of sublime. From the character models to the base animations, and from the lighting to the depth and density of the environments the player can explore, everything is top-notch. It’s unmistakably a Kingdom Come game, but it has been taken to the next level by the team at Warhorse and it’s a pleasure to behold.</p>



<p>I explored the game beyond the demo, taking the time to study the menus and the UI, and I ultimately failed to find a flaw with anything. It has all been fully refreshed for this second outing, and everything just <strong>worked</strong>. The menus are intuitive, the UI has been made more accessible, and everything from crafting to levelling up is easy to understand and makes sense.</p>



<p>Even the smaller details have been improved upon. For instance, in KCD (2018), opening doors often resulted in a fumbling hand reaching for a handle, but I noticed that in KCDII, Henry firmly grasped door handles. If you’re not enthused by studying the smaller details in an open-world RPG title, you won’t understand why elements like this are so exciting.</p>



<h2 id="h-bigger-better-bolder">Bigger, Better, Bolder</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 promises to be a monumental sequel. The story leads on directly from the first game, so it’ll undoubtedly help if you can take a walk through the 2018 title and get up to speed. Warhorse has doubled the size of the world, but it hasn’t lost that sense of identity. It’s expansive, but it’s also packed with things to see and do.</p>



<p>It’s also fully open-ended. The skill system in-game means that you’re able to create your own Henry of Skalitz, and you’re free to use the weapons, armour, and abilities that you see fit. It’s also rooted in realism once again, so everything from the combat mechanics to the way people behave is period-accurate.</p>



<p>I went from playing KCD to exploring KCDII in the space of a week, which I think was the best way to approach it. The difference between the two games is staggering, and as I soaked up the KCDII, I had my hair blown back. It’s smooth, it’s entertaining, and everyone at Warhorse Studios should be proud of the product they’ve put together.</p>



<p>I can see KCDII becoming my Game of the Year in 2025 – but it does have some <strong>strong </strong>competition.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 11, 2025, on PS5, XSX, and PC.</p>

<p>The Esports Awards 2024 ceremony has just wrapped up and every trophy has been handed out. This iconic event took place in Saudi Arabia to coincide with the Esports World Cup, which will end in a couple of days following two months of intense competitive action. In this breakdown, we’re going to outline every winner at the Esports Awards 2024 showcase. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-awards-winners">All Esports Awards Winners</h2>



<p>In the run-up to the Esports Awards, controversy surfaced as some ruling panellists dropped out of the event. This was mostly attributed to the setting of the Esports Awards, with some claiming that the organisers had just ‘accepted a bag’ to assist with the ‘esportswashing’ of Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>Despite that, the Esports Awards 2024 ceremony played out positively, and some very deserving folks won their respective trophies. Unfortunately, it looked as though viewership took a hit this year, with Esports Charts reporting fewer hours watched and a lower peak concurrent viewership than the 2023 ceremony.</p>



<p>Here’s every winner from the Esports Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Streamer of the Year: </strong>Samantha ‘Rivers’ Rivera Trevino</li>



<li><strong>Esports Personality of the Year: </strong>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner</li>



<li><strong>Esports Content Group of the Year: </strong>S8UL Esports</li>



<li><strong>Esports Game of the Year: </strong>VALORANT</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Esports Game of the Year: </strong>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>



<li><strong>Esports Coverage Platform of the Year: </strong>Liquipedia</li>



<li><strong>Esports Publisher of the Year: </strong>Riot Games</li>



<li><strong>Esports Commercial Partner of the Year: </strong>Red Bull</li>



<li><strong>Esports Creative Team of the Year: </strong>Team Liquid</li>



<li><strong>Esports Content of the</strong> <strong>Year: </strong>League of Legends – GODS ft. NewJeans</li>



<li><strong>Breakthrough Player of the Year:</strong> Stanislav ‘Malr1ne’ Potorak</li>



<li><strong>Breakthrough Game of the Year: </strong>Teamfight Tactics</li>



<li><strong>Esports Analyst of the Year: </strong>Jacob ‘Pimp’ Winneche</li>
</ul>



<p>Outside of the core trophy list, <strong>Jens Hilgers </strong>picked up the Lifetime Achievement Award for many years of work and dedication to the industry. </p>



<p>Do you think these winners are deserving of their trophies?</p>

            <p>Stranger Video is a website that wants access to your webcam. Grant it and it will show you a close-up of your own face, the background around you cropped out. Close your eyes to tell it you're ready, and open them again when you hear a chime. It'll now connect you to a stranger doing the same thing: first person to blink loses.
</p>
<p>You <a href="https://stranger.video/">can play it here</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'm playing it <em>right now</em> and no one else in the world is. Let's all of us play it together.
</p>
<p>Stranger Video is work of Eieio, who makes "stuff for the 2000s internet." It has that old school, lofi, '00s vibe, as if a leftover from the personal web. It's also from the same creator as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-called-one-million-checkboxes-has-sparked-a-terrible-online-war">One Million Checkboxes, which Edwin wrote about back in June</a>. 
</p>
<p>Both of these are nominees in <a href="https://tinyawards.net/">the Tiny Awards</a>, which aims to celebrate "the other web, the one that is small and handmade and isn’t trying to sell you anything or monetise anything but which instead is about people using the digital tools we all have access to to make the sorts of small, personal experiences that you tend not to see ‘in feed’." It's a trove of beautiful websites.</p>
<p>Anyway. Put your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/staring-eyes">staring eyes</a> where your mouth is, RPS readers.

            <p>Valve have their own rating system for measuring how games run on Steam Deck, but even following the guidance of whether something is "Playable" or "Verified", I've still run into games that simply do not work on the handheld device.
</p>
<p>Enter Steam reviews. Reviews from players who primarily played on Steam Deck will now have a little Deck icon, which when moused over tells you the exact amount of time spent on the Deck.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Steam users can also filter in search of these reviews by clicking the 'Playtime' dropdown at the top of the reviews section and selecting "Played mostly on Steam Deck."
</p>
<p>This is a relatively minor change, but ooh it's a useful one. I play a lot of games on Steam given my career, such as it is, and it makes a big difference knowing upfront whether something is going to work comfortably on the Deck or whether I need to continue hunching over my desktop for 60+ hours every week.
</p>
<p>Valve have made a handful of tweaks to Steam user reviews of late. Earlier this month they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-latest-update-to-user-reviews-doesnt-find-your-jokes-memes-ascii-art-and-other-content-as-funny-as-you-do">moved to de-prioritise user reviews that were extremely short or which contained ASCII art</a>, because although these reviews may be funny (or "funny"), they're not helpful to those making purchasing decisions. 
</p>
<p>You could always skip the user reviews and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews">read ours</a>, mind. We sometimes review games on Steam Deck and always note when we do (recently, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crimson-diamond-review">The Crimson Diamond</a>), and James is forever testing games on the device for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck Academy</a>.

            <p>Tens of thousands of people have been playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, a new multiplayer shooter from Valve, for the past several months, but in that time there's been no official announcement or acknowledgement of the game's existence by its creators. Until now. Valve have posted an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">extremely barebones Steam store page for Deadlock</a>, describing it as a "multiplayer game in early development."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Deadlock is still in early development stages with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay," says the page. "Access to Deadlock is currently limited to friend invites via our playtesters." The page a lso contains a single 22 second teaser trailer and no screenshots.
</p>
<p>Deadlock is being <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">played by 63,000 people at the time of writing</a>, however. Previously those with access to the beta were asked "not share anything about the game with anyone," although inevitably footage did leak out into the wider web. That restriction has now been fully lifted, with people posting thoughts and more videos across the internet.
</p>
<p>It sounds as if Deadlock is a mixture of Dota and Super Monday Night Combat; a third-person, 6v6 multiplayer shooter with lanes, respawning creeps, and a skyrail transit system.
</p>
<p>I've seen it argued that it's bizarre for Valve not to announce a game so many people are clearly playing, but frankly I can understand the decision. Valve are known for cancelling projects during development, and as a genre, a lot of multiplayer shooters seem to stumble during their beta phase. How many games have Ubisoft announced in the last five years, for example, only to cancel the moment players touched themn? My only disappointment is that Valve didn't find a more interesting name than "Deadlock" before making it official.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
