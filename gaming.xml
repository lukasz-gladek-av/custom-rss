			<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed three million players. They also shared the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅2nd highest Day 1 sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history</li>
<li>✅Biggest Ubisoft Day 1 ever on PlayStation Digital Store</li>
<li>✅Best community ever, with over 40 Million hours already played</li>
</ul>
<p>This follows the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming a million seller on launch day</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching two million units on March 22</a>. Since then, we also learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-biggest-physical-game-of-the-year-in-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best retail launch of 2025 in the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The game has undoubtedly been well-received. On Steam, the average review verdict is 'Very Positive' (82%). Critics were also quite positive; the game was rated 8.7 out of 10 here on Wccftech in the review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>The game's success came at an absolutely critical time for Ubisoft. Earlier today, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the rumored decision to form a new subsidiary that will take control of Ubisoft's most successful franchises: Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and Assassin's Creed itself. The strong performance of Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly allowed Ubisoft to be stronger in the negotiations. Just like the rumors had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a>, Tencent has a 25% minority stake in the new subsidiary following a cash investment of €1.16 billion.</p>

The massive deal allows the founding Guillemot family to remain in control of the publisher despite its recent struggles and cratering share price. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196566" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The details of the agreement are complex and it’s not immediately clear how it will all hash out in practice. The new entity doesn’t have a name yet but will have its own board of supervisors and include Ubisoft studios Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Those teams will be in charge of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> franchises moving forward, as well as their back catalogs. But all of it will still report up to Ubisoft proper and its current CEO, Yves Guillemot.<br></p><p> “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success,” Guillemot said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> on Thursday. “With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.” </p><p>On a call with investors following the announcement, however, the company’s leadership clarified that Ubisoft 2, or whatever it ends up being called, will still report up to Guillemot. “There will be a dedicated management under the supervision of a board that will be controlled by Ubisoft,” CFO Frederick Duguet told investors. “So Ubisoft will continue controlling and consolidating this entity.”</p><p>The major deal comes after months of speculation about a possible sale of the French publisher following a year of poor sales for some of its biggest recent blockbusters, including <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, as well as delays and cancellations of other big releases, including free-to-play shooter&nbsp;<em>The Division Heartland</em>. Those rumors included a shareholder report that Ubisoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was even exploring a sale</a></span> of some of its franchises to Microsoft and others. Under the new structure, series like <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Rayman</em> will remain under the broader Ubisoft umbrella. <br></p><p>Ubisoft is a sprawling organization with studios and employees spread out all over the world. The complex web facilitates a co-development process that the company uses to ship massive games in shorter time periods. But that also means that there’s no clean delineation between who works on what. While The Montreal and Quebec studios lead development on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise, many employees within those offices still work on other franchises as needed. </p><p>Asked by investors how many of Ubisoft’s over 17,000 employees would be moving to the new group, the company said it was still too early to tell. That sentiment was echoed in an email sent to staff today from Ubisoft head of studios Marie-Sophie de Waubert. This brings some uncertainty and questions,” she wrote in an email obtained by<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>. “Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly.”</p><p>Two key provisions of the new agreement are that Tencent cannot sell its 25 percent equity stake for at least five years and Ubisoft “may not cease to hold a majority of New subsidiary voting rights and share capital for a 2-year period.” In the near term at least, the $1.25 billion deal sounds more like a financial instrument than anything else, and one that provides Ubisoft’s current ownership with more time to try to improve the company’s financial outlook. Prior to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadow</em>’s launch, many asked if it would be enough to save the company from being broken up and sold for parts. For now at least, it seems like it won’t need to. </p><p><em>Update 3/27/2025 2:35 p.m. ET: Added more context from the investor call and internal emails. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Move over, Terminator – an old familiar face is back in town and standing ready to take the spot of the most overpowered, controversial Call of Duty skin. When Season 03 arrives in Black Ops 6 on April 2, players will be able to unlock R0-Z3, a modern-day recreation of one of the sweatiest Operators in Call of Duty history.</p>



<p>Back in the day, ‘Roze’ was the firm favourite for players looking for an (unfair) edge over the competition. Her skin was darker than dark and made her a shadow in dimly-lit areas, and even a redesign to lighten her up didn’t do much to stem the sales.</p>



<p>There’s a really sneaky catch, though. You can only get the R0-Z3 skin if you own the BlackCell Battle Pass – the most expensive Battle Pass variant in Call of Duty. Surprise, surprise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signature-sweat">Signature Sweat</h2>



<p>The R0-Z3 skin, which is an all-new take on the classic Roze Operator, will be available exclusively through the BlackCell Battle Pass, which just so happens to be one of the most expensive single purchases you can make in Call of Duty. It’ll set you back $30 to obtain Season 03’s BlackCell Battle Pass, which is more than the average skin pack by far.</p>



<p>Here’s the spiel for R0-Z3, published in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Call of Duty blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The new BlackCell Operator R0-Z3 arrives in an animated mantle and her signature mask along with her faithful hound, leading an awesome array of Season 03 BlackCell content. She is joined by a roster of teched out Operator Skins, sleek Weapon Blueprints, and sci-fi themed unlocks earned exclusively through BlackCell.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She looks as familiar as ever, but she has some golden splashes that make her fit with the BlackCell brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Roze first appeared in Warzone in July 2020, mere months after the game hit the market. She became a staple of the battle royale landscape, with everyone grinding the battle pass to Tier 100 to acquire the legendary Operator skin.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $30 to spare, you’ll be happy enough picking up BlackCell, and admittedly, it comes with heaps of bonus features for the avid Call of Duty fan. There are BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints for a range of firearms, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a>, which are returning for the reappearance of Verdansk in Warzone.</p>



<p>You’ll also get 1,100 COD Points, a 10% XP boost, and several exclusive skins for an array of Operators. They’re not as popular as R0-Z3 will be, but you never know.</p>



<p>Do you plan on getting the R0-Z3 skin as soon as possible, ready for Verdansk’s return? Let me know in the comments.</p>

It’s a move that finally allows two hidden-gem PlayStation games from the mid-2000s to stomp onto non-PlayStation platforms for the first time while updating them for PS5 players, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having lived in the desolate frontier for years, the Patapon tribe was driven from their home by the Zigoton army,” an official description from new publisher Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This drove them to become fierce warrior spirits that can only be commanded by the beat of the war drum, played by the Mighty One (the player). Their wait has finally come to an end as the drums of war are heard once again by the Almighty’s return to guide the Patapon tribe through their adventures to fight against challenging enemies and return them to their homeland.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon 1+2 Replay seems to come with a few upgrades not seen in the 2017 PS4 remasters. Bandai Namco specifically lists upgraded graphics as one of the more noticeable additions, though returning Almighty will also notice added Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty modes, as well as timing adjustment and constant command display options. While Patapon 1+2 Replay aims to bring the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon">2007</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-2">2008</a> titles to players better than ever, there’s no sign of the PSP’s 2011 title, Patapon 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon may not be one of PlayStation’s more recognizable franchises, but it’s still a name that has been associated with the brand for nearly 20 years. It’s unclear why or how it’s leaping other platforms now or if the series will continue to blossom with any new entries in the future. There’s also been no mention of a potential Xbox version, so it’s best to expect Patapon 1+2 Replay on PC, Switch, and PS5 to be where things end for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on today’s news, you can catch up with everything else revealed during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

While called Everybody's Golf in many regions, the series was Hot Shots Golf in North America for a while, until 2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everybodys-golf">Everybody's Golf</a> reunited the franchise name. This latest entry, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, looks to mark as much by combining the two names into one unified, new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting twist in the details, though. Digimon Survive studio HYDE is making this, under the Bandai Namco umbrella, in a partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Traditionally, this has been a Sony-published series, and developer Clap Hanz was working on the series. Clap Haz released its own self-titled game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-20-years-making-playstation-golf-games-clap-hanz-wants-a-new-challenge">Clap Hanz Golf</a>, back in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it looks like you can expect the usual blend of classic golf and some of the wackier options. Characters have their expressive celebrations, and several game modes offer strange, surprising mix-ups to your usual round of golf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be local couch co-op and online multiplayer, which is good news for those who, like me, grew up passing a controller around playing Hot Shots Golf. The announcement debuted during today's Nintendo Switch Direct, and I could see Everybody's Golf Hot Shots working pretty well as a couch co-op Switch game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No date's been set yet, but Everybody's Golf Hot Shots will be heading to PS5, Switch, and PC sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">head over to our recap of today's Nintendo Direct for March 2025</a> if you're looking for other announcements.

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible – meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect — everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes? We want you to experience those feelings again—or maybe for the first time.</p><p><strong>Tapping the Best of the Genre</strong></p><p>Far from mindlessly relying on cliché and formula, <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> turns the genre on its head. The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,603 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Extended Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="The Eternal Life of Goldman | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebAKFMH1CHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When there's as big a brand as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/the-walt-disney-company">Disney</a>, that has enough money to just kind of throw whatever at the wall and see what sticks, eventually you wind up with something that might make you scratch your head a bit. Today, that thing is Disney Villains Cursed Café, a visual novel where you serve a bevy of potions to various Disney baddies, announced earlier today as part of the final Nintendo Direct for the OG Switch (but yes, it is on PC too - in fact it's already out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2439220/Disney_Villains_Cursed_Caf/">Steam</a>).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The concept is pretty simple: you are a Potionista, someone that, uh, brews potions, and you run a café frequented by Disney villains from a range of its films. That includes folks like Jafar from Aladdin, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, all of them wearing not exactly casual outfits, but clothing you could see them wearing on the weekend at the very least.

<p>
For the most part gameplay looks simple. Brew a potion, serve them to the villain, listen to their stories. As mentioned it's a visual novel, and the emphasis more seems to be about chatting with Disney villains than anything particularly more complex (not to say that visual novel can't be complex, it's just this one doesn't seem to be).
</p>
<p>
There's just one thing I find a bit icky about it, as has been pointed out by several other people across social media, that being that it kind of seems to be ripping off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a>. I don't exactly love a giant like the House of Mouse trying to corporate-wash a beloved indie game like that in all honesty. Anyway, Maleficent getting an iPhone is kind of funny I guess.

This new system will go live in late April and will be compatible with Switch 2 at launch.

These will only be playable on Switch 2 and will likely be enhanced native ports of older titles. </p><p>Here’s the full text with the important bits bolded: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and<strong> Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting! While we’ve known for a while now that Switch games will be mostly backward compatible with Switch 2, this is the first official mention of the possibility that some older games might get native ports to Switch 2. This will likely work similarly to PS4 games on PS5: most of them play just fine (or even better) on the more powerful hardware, but there are some titles that have received separate, native PS5 ports. For example, <em>Death Stranding</em> on PS4 plays great on PS5.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But you can spend $10 to upgrade to the PS5 version which unlocks new visual features and options</a></span>.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Nintendo about this fine print and what it means. </p><p>For now, we can only speculate as to what “Switch 2 Edition” means. One possibility is that some of these Switch 2 Edition games will run at a higher framerate. Recently, dataminers discovered unused 60FPS code in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a></span>. Many are theorizing that the game will run at a higher FPS on Switch 2. And that might be true, but perhaps only while playing a theoretical Switch 2 Edition of it. </p><p>Will you have to pay for these native ports? Maybe. Will they support cross-save and crossplay with older versions? Possibly. We don’t know yet, but hopefully we’ll learn more on April 2 during the announced Switch 2-focused Direct. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft and Tencent announced a new subsidiary valued at approximately €4 billion ($4.3 billion). Insider Gaming has received Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s internal memo on the announcement.</p>



<div><p>It reads,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I’m pleased to share an important announcement that will mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history.</p><p>Following a process to review different strategic options for Ubisoft’s future, we have just signed an exceptional agreement with one of our trusted shareholders, Tencent, with whom we have a solid relationship.</p><p>Their €1.16 billion investment will benefit all of Ubisoft. We will be able to firmly take back control of our future and renew with the serenity needed to create the best games.</p><p>The terms of this partnership are straightforward: we will establish a dedicated subsidiary within Ubisoft that will bring together our three most powerful franchises: Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. This subsidiary will gather the teams working on these brands, primarily in the studios of Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Tencent will be a 25% shareholder of this new subsidiary, with the aim of boosting these franchises so they become undisputed global icons.</p><p>This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises.</p><p>This investment will also give us the means to accelerate the changes we’ve been discussing for several months across the group – changes that many of you have been longing for, as revealed by the Ubisoft XP survey. These changes are in line with the initiatives that Marie-Sophie has been sharing recently, which aim to put the creation of unique games and player satisfaction back at the heart of our daily work. This is what will enable us to return to a higher level of profitability.</p><p>This announcement comes at a pivotal time, after the very positive reception of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the excitement sparked by the announcement of Rainbow 6 Siege X, of which we can be very proud.</p><p>I want to express my deepest gratitude for your resilience, tenacity, courage, and creativity – all the qualities that make Ubisoft a truly unique company and that helped us overcome a challenging period over the last few years.</p></div>



<div><p>The coming months will be dedicated to shaping our next chapter. Of course, this new step in our transformation will raise many questions, including on an individual level. We are committed to keeping you regularly informed, answering your questions, and providing visibility on the next steps.</p><p>I hope you can join the global livestream that will be held tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. CET during which I will share a few words with you. You’ll receive an invitation shortly.</p><p>See you tomorrow, and thank you again,</p><p>Yves”</p></div>



<hr>



<div><p>Understandably, employee’s are now nervous. In a follow-up email, Marie-Sophie de Waubert (Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer) said,</p><p>“Hello everyone,</p><p>I wanted to follow up immediately with all of you in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia after Yves’ email regarding the new Business Unit that is being created.</p><p>First and foremost, I want to emphasize that the agreement we announced is a powerful enabler and an exciting opportunity for Ubisoft. It will help us accelerate our evolution and improve how we make games with greater focus and agility.</p><p>Tencent’s investment is a strong testament to their trust in our ability to grow Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. This is a direct result of the incredible work you’ve done in making these franchises iconic, as a lead or major codev studio.</p><p>I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less. This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months, we will work hard to build the best organization possible – for Ubisoft, for our teams, and for our players.</p><p>Of course, this brings some uncertainty and questions. Right now, we may not have all the detailed answers, but we are committed to communicating with you transparently and regularly. Supporting you through this transition is the top priority for your local and your global leadership teams. Don’t hesitate to reach out to them and stay tuned locally; usual or dedicated “studio times” will be also good forums to keep you updated and answer your questions.”</p></div>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it will be forming a new subsidiary with Tencent valued at approximately 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).</p>



<p>Tencent will be investing €1.16 billion for a 25% stake, with the new subsidiary set to including IPs including Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. It will also include Ubisoft’s studios located in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia.</p>



<p>In an internal email to staff that has been acquired by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the move will “mark a milestone in Ubisoft’s history”.</p>



<p>“This historic agreement is above all a recognition of the extraordinary work you have been doing for years: the value of these three brands directly reflects your individual and collective talent and efforts, which have allowed us to create these beloved franchises,” Guillemot said.</p>



<p>Guillemot also added that the investment from Tencent gives the company the “means to accelerate the changes we’ve been discussing for several months across the group—changes that many of you have been longing for, as revealed by the Ubisoft XP survey.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft senior vice president Marie-Sophie de Waubert commented that the company believes that Tencent’s investment into Ubisoft is a “strong testament to their trust” in the company’s ability to grow Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>“This is a direct result of the incredible work you’ve done in making these franchises iconic,” she said.</p>



<p>De Waubert did admit that the news will bring “some uncertainty and questions” for many within Ubisoft. Despite not having all of the answers “right now”, she said in the email that management is “committed to communicating with [employees] transparently and regularly.”</p>

For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p><p>Producer Rosie Ball added, “Embracing a four-day work week and a firm no-crunch policy has been a huge part of realizing our approach to game development – that the team feels valued, rested and supported. We know creativity flourishes in a healthy work environment, and we’re confident that the mindful and deliberate pace of <em>Witchbrook</em> delivers this experience to the players.”</p><p>Art director Steph Caskenette said, “<em>Witchbrook</em> is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us. Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Chucklefish:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced a major change</a> to its organization as it looks to the future, as the company has created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on three main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Tencent is investing €1.16 billion ($1.25 billion USD) to take a minority stake (about 25%) in this new subsidiary.</p><p>Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel. However, it's unknown to what extent these changes could result in potential layoffs or studio closures.</p><p>"This new subsidiary will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform. Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>Alongside the announcement of this new business entity, Ubisoft said it will "focus on nurturing" some of its other franchises, including Ghost Recon and The Division, while also continuing to make new IP and building out its game engine technologies and online services. Ubisoft said it will share more information "at a later stage."</p><p>Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said this marks a "new chapter" in Ubisoft's history, calling this a "foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model."</p><p>"With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises' long-term growth and success," Guillemot said.</p><p>Tencent president Martin Lau said, "We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</p><p>In terms of further specifics, the new subsidiary includes the development teams working on Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Ubisoft said it also includes any new games in those places under development currently or that are made in the future, along with back catalog titles from those teams. This new subsidiary is getting rights to the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises in exchange for an unspecified royalty payment.</p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p><p>Ubisoft's latest big release was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which debuted on March 20, quickly reaching 3 million players and collecting strong reviews from critics.</p>

Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet won't launch before 2027, according to one of gaming's more credible distributors of gossip and speculation. That's fine, because they haven't announced the sci-fi action-adventure for PC yet. Here's the reveal trailer again, in case you missed it.

<p>
The aforesaid "credible distributor of gossip and speculation" is Jason Schreier, author of whole entire books of insider journalism - he's been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">spilling the beans on Resetera</a>. I have recently become aware of this "book" phenomenon. My understanding is that a "book" is a jailbroken iPad consisting of pounded cobwebs that must be physically gripped and "turned" using Wiimote-style gyroscopic finger inputs.</p>
<p>Journalism contained by books tends to undergo more stringent fact-checking and, as such, enjoys a higher status than the traditional video game information vehicle of a salacious username on Reddit that was accidentally right about one of 12 "leaks" three years ago, and has been duly promoted to internet Cassandra. What I am laboriously saying is that I trust Schreier the Bookman rather more than user TurboJackoff69 who once correctly predicted the coming of rightward-sloping laptop vents. Oh yeah, and Schreier also writes for Bloomberg. They're pretty credible too.
</p>
<p>
Intergalactic is set thousands of years in the future, and casts you as a bounty hunter stranded on a forgotten planet full of ancient religion and blade-o-bots. It's been in development since 2020, and apparently takes inspiration from Akira and Cowboy Bebop, which are a bit "chalk and cheese" as anime influences go. I mean, Bebop has darker moments, but it's not quite doing experiments on psychic children, is it.  
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a key goal of Intergalactic is making the player feel lost and alone, which is great news for those of us who feared that Naughty Dog might pivot back to Drakish quipfire after all the sexy heartache of The Last Of Us.</p>
<p>"I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history," Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA">told</a> 28 Days Later director Alex Garland earlier this month (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Eurogamer</a>). Player character Jordan A. Mun doesn't even have any friends to banter with, though I personally wouldn't rule out Naughty Dog introducing a robot pal. Perhaps you'll talk to it about matters of faith. In my experience, it's harder to do top bantz when there's religion involved. 
</p>
<p>
It has taken Naughty Dog five long years to bring The Last Of Us: Part 2 to PC - look out for it on 3rd April. It seems likely that Intergalactic will be a key PS6 launch game - as such, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes even longer to escape consoledom. Still, Sony launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC and PS5 simultaneously and that made a heck of a lot of money. Perhaps when 2027 swings around they'll be more open to the idea of a same-day release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re an anime enthusiast as well, you may have had your eye on <em>AI Limit</em>, which costs only $35. This may leave you wondering how long of a journey the game offers and whether it’s worth investing in.

However, <strong>an average playthrough is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. This includes reaching the final boss without completing every side-quest or searching every nook and cranny.</p><p>But completionists can certainly get more from the game, especially those looking to score every achievement it has to offer.

More importantly, you’ll be able to set yourself up for different endings. <strong>Doing all of this can easily net you upwards of 40 hours worth of gameplay in <em>AI Limit</em></strong>. </p><p>Again, how much time you ultimately get out of <em>AI Limit</em> will depend at least partially on your skill level and whether you reference any guides for helping you find any particularly well-hidden secrets.

Announced during Nintendo Direct March 2025, Rhythm Heaven Groove is set to launch on Nintendo Switch in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Heaven's last appearance was almost a decade ago back in 2016 with Rhythm Heaven: Megamix, which similarly showed up on the 3DS riiiight as the console was starting to wind down. Megamix featured 70 returning games and 30 brand new games, and until now was the best and most comprehensive place to play Rhythm Heaven. The series itself has long been beloved for its fun, intuitive rhythm mini-games and delightful original music by Japanese singer Tsunku and Nintendo composer Masami Yone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tsunku was listed on the Rhythm Heaven Groove splash screen as returning to compose once again. Tsunku <a href="https://www.vgmonline.net/rhythm-heaven-music-producer-tsunku-recovering-from-cancer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced in 2014</a> that he had laryngeal cancer, and underwent surgery to have his vocal cords removed. He has since stepped away from a number of his past projects, so his return for Rhythm Heaven is a hopeful sign that he may be doing better and is still up for crafting the excellent music that makes Rhythm Heaven as good as it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-turn-based-combat-all-but-demanding-replays/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>More than just rolling for initiative</h2>
<p>Obsidian <a href="https://fextralife.com/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-turn-based-combat-mechanics-explained/">added a turn-based mode</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> in patch 4.1, roughly eight months after the game's initial release. Designer Josh Sawyer, who worked on&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate II&nbsp;</em>and directed&nbsp;both&nbsp;<em>PoE</em> games, said in a 2023<a href="https://toucharcade.com/2023/10/18/pentiment-anniversary-interview-josh-sawyer-on-hi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Ding-a-potential-pillars-of-eternity-3-rpg-mechanics-and-more/"> interview with Touch Arcade</a> that the real-time systems in the <em>PoE</em>&nbsp;games were largely a concession to the old-school CRPG fans that crowdfunded both games.</p>
<p>Turn-based was Sawyer's stated preference, and he thinks <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> largely put an end to the debate in modern times:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just think it’s easier to design more intricate combats. I like games with a lot of stats, obviously. (He laughs). But the problem with real time with pause is that it’s honestly very difficult for people to actually parse all of that information, and one of the things I’ve heard a lot from people who’ve played <em>Deadfire</em> in turn based, is that there were things about the game like the affliction and inspiration system that they didn’t really understand very clearly until they played it in turn based.</p></blockquote>
<p>But both&nbsp;<em>Pillars&nbsp;</em>games were designed with real-time combat in mind, such that, even with his appreciation for the turn-based addition to&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>, Sawyer knows "the game wasn't designed for it," he told Touch Arcade. This is almost certainly going to be the case, too, for the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, but there could be lessons learned from&nbsp;<em>PoE 2</em>'s transformation to apply. Other games from that era might also lure folks like me back, though perhaps they, too, have a density of encounters and maps that just can't cut it for turn-based.</p>
<p>Beyond this notably big "patch" coming to the original&nbsp;<em>PoE</em>, the 10th anniversary patch should make it easier for Mac and Linux (through Proton) users to stay up to date on bug fixes, and for players on GOG and Epic to get Kickstarter rewards and achievements. Lots of audio and visual effects were fixed up, along with a whole heap of mechanical and combat fixes.</p>

                <p>Despite everything, Undertale is now 10 years old. To celebrate the momentous occasion, a one-night-only orchestral concert, The Determination Symphony, has been announced. Those looking to <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase tickets</a> for the exclusive event--which will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on June 22, 2025--can do so starting tomorrow, March 28, at 6 AM ET.</p><p>According to the event's press release, the concert will run for approximately two hours and will encompass Undertale's 10-year history, taking fans on a journey from "the initial fall at Mount Ebott, and leading them through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Temple, Temmie Village, and so much more." Accompanying this adventure is a 25-piece orchestra that will be performing developer Toby Fox's original music, which has received unending praise and critical-acclaim throughout the past decade. This praise includes that given in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/undertale-review-nintendo-switch-update/1900-6416315/" data-ref-id="1900-6416315">Undertale review</a>, in which we wrote, "Undertale's soundtrack has timeless appeal and is great at evoking emotions."</p><p>Lambert Jackson Productions, the London-based studio behind the Oliver award-nominated play Cruise, will be heading production for The Determination Symphony. The event is scheduled to take place at the Eventim Apollo (formerly the Hammersmith Apollo), one of London's premiere theaters.</p><p>In other Undertale news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/" data-ref-id="1100-6530156">recently broke its own Steam record</a> for concurrent players. After listing the game for $1 as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-spring-sale-2025-deals/2900-6318/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6318">Steam Spring Sale</a>, developer Toby Fox took to X to announce the news, writing that this was the first time this had happened since the game was released back in 2015. Last October, Fox confirmed that Undertale follow-up Deltarune's next chapters will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-definitely-be-released-in-2025-toby-fox-says/1100-6527507/" data-ref-id="1100-6527507">released some time in 2025</a>. The first two chapters of Deltarune are currently available for free on PC, PS4, and Switch.</p>
