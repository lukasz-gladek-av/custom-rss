<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director has mentioned the possibility of a DLC or another ‘full title’ after part 3.</p>



<p>There’s still some time left before Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Part 3 is revealed; however, we do know that development has been progressing well, with the game already having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘a lot’ of playable content</a>. Interestingly, the developers are already thinking about their plans after the release of part 3, which could entail a new expansion or a fourth game. </p>



<h2 id="h-there-s-a-possibility-of-a-fourth-game-for-the-final-fantasy-7-remake-series">There’s a Possibility of a Fourth Game for the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WccfTech</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked whether they had any DLC plans for Rebirth. Hamaguchi stated that there were ideas at some point, but they “revisited this topic” and realised that their priority should be what fans want the most. The dev figured that “what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible.” Which meant that the next game took priority over DLC. </p>



<p>However, Hamaguchi revealed that the story doesn’t end there, as “there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment” after its launch. Moreover, with that being the conclusion to Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy, “there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole”, says the director. Which is why the developers are “actively considering” whether to introduce “another DLC or a full title”. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 9 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be ‘on ice’</a>, according to a new claim.

            <p>Blockbuster games with outsized budgets and big spectacle are "not really sustainable in terms of the cost of development", said former God of War exec Meghan Morgan Juinio, adding games need to be "fun first".</p>
<p>Juinio recently left her position as director of product development at Sony's Santa Monica Studios, where she worked on the God of War series. She discussed the current state of blockbuster game development with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/god-of-war-producer-says-the-blockbuster-games-industry-needs-to-steer-away-from-spectacle-and-focus-on-what-matters-if-its-not-fun-its-not-worth-the-investment/">PC Gamer</a> at Gamescom Asia.</p>
<p>"I think it's already not really sustainable in terms of the cost of development," she said. "There's been a ton of layoffs, and a lot of that is focused on the West Coast of the US, and it's clearly because the minimum costs are so high. Development costs will necessitate that the big publishers create [new] pathways."</p>

<p>While big budget games like God of War won't be going away, Juinio believes larger publishers will look to AA or single A games for inspiration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, successful games should be fun to play, rather than focusing on flashy graphics and presentation.</p>
<p>"I think what it comes back to," said Juinio, "is just make something fun. Just make something awesome, and that will achieve what you need it to achieve."</p>
<p>She continued: "My opinion is that it has to be fun first. It can look the most beautiful, the best soundtrack in the world, it can be winning all the BAFTAs for audio and all this, but if it's not fun it's not worth the investment, whether that's $2m or $500m.</p><p>"And I think that's where the biggest publishers can return: how do we go back to building solid games that are really fun to play. Maybe they aren't 40 hours long, and maybe they aren't the most cutting edge - but that doesn't matter if the core experience is really fun."</p>
<p>This year, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Peak have proven that games from smaller teams with smaller budgets can still make a huge impact. Juinio acknowledged, however, there remains an increasing problem of access and game discovery when there are simply so many games being released.</p>
<p>For Sony specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-ok-to-make-a-small-game-says-astro-bot-director-on-its-aa-level-success">Astro Bot is perhaps a key example of critical, award-winning success based on smart AA-sized ambition</a>.</p>
<p>"It's OK to make a small game," said its director Nicolas Doucet during a talk at this year's GDC.</p>
<p>"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in the second week rather than a bad spot in the first week," he continued. "A lot of choices we made with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter. We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>

<p>According to producer Takeshi Ichikawa in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/19/158538.html">GameSpark</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-7s-dark-and-sorrowful-story-may-resonate-with-players-now-more-than-it-did-back-in-the-day-remake-producer-says/">Automaton</a>), this is actually a key factor in the team's decision to bring the game back for modern platforms.

<blockquote>
<p>“We decided to launch the project for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined because we felt that the game’s unique atmosphere and tone would resonate especially well with players today. Back when it first came out, VII was often said to have more dark and sorrowful episodes compared to other entries in the series.</p>
<p>"But nowadays, players are much more accustomed to games with darker stories. I believe that, through this new version, modern players will be able to feel VII’s story and the emotions of the characters even more deeply.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due for release on <strong>5th February 2026</strong> (shortly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on 20th January 2026), Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is a full-on remake built from the ground up with gorgeous diorama-like visuals.</p>
<p>While the overall story will remain unchanged, Reimagined will streamline the narrative while introducing some key gameplay enhancements.</p>

            <p>It turns out that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> may be messing with the aim of PC users playing on mouse and keyboard. Thankfully, by adjusting a few settings, you should be able to improve your ability to hit your shots in EA's massive military shooter.</p>
<p>This process was first widely <a href="https://x.com/TorbisXD/status/1979494906830696780">publicised by Battlefield 6 content creator TorbisXD on X</a>, who messed around in the settings to discover three options that were impacting his ability to hit shots while aiming down sights.</p>
<p>Here's the fix. First, go to your Mouse and Keyboard settings, then go to the Controls sub settings menu at the top under the Infantry section. Once there, turn Uniform Infantry Aiming off for now, as this'll allow you to alter several other aiming settings linked to it.</p>

</figure>
<p>With Uniform Infantry Aiming turned off, scroll down to the Zoom section of the Controls menu and you'll see an option called Zoom Transition Sensitivity Smoothing. Turn this off. Then, re-enable Uniform Infantry Aiming. For the final step, you'll see an option called Zoom Sensitivity coefficient right below Uniform Infantry Aiming - turn this to zero.</p><p>Okay, so what are all these tweaks to settings actually doing? Well, Uniform Infantry Aiming keeps your aiming sensitivity the same regardless of what you're doing - whether aiming down your sights or shooting from the hip. It's very useful, which is why it's been left on. However, Zoom Transition Sensitivity Smoothing attempts to add additional sensitivity to your aim when aiming-down-sights.</p>
<p>In layperson's terms, with default settings enabled, your aiming sensitivity was sped up whenever you aimed down your sights. With these changes to the settings, your ADS speed should be uniform across the board, which should feel a tad more natural.</p>
<p>It turns out a lot of people are having a grand time with Battlefield 6. According to an official statement by EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">over seven million players bought and played the game in the week following its official launch</a>. This popularity came in spite of a few bugs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">some even throwing off player's aim in extended firefights</a>, though many of these have been fixed in short order.</p>

            <p>Time to phone Genghis Khan. Tell him the news. There's gonna be a bit more waiting before you can become 13th century Mongolia's a truest Yam courier rider/horse befriender. Following its latest Steam Next Fest demo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-fascinated-by-this-open-world-delivery-game-that-sounds-like-death-stranding-on-a-horse-in-13th-century-mongolia-with-unparalleled-equine-realism">The Legend of Khiimori</a>'s early access release has been pushed back to March next year.</p>
<p>I know, throw down your spurs like they're Yosemite Sam's hat. There's neigh way developers Aesir Interactive and NightinGames have done this to you. Well, they have, but they say they've got the game's best interests at heart.</p>

<p>The equine delivery sim's now set to emerge from early access on March 3rd, 2026, its developers have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2697000/view/519727718097487890?l=english">announced</a>. "The wonderful reception during Steam Next Fest has led to us sitting down with our publisher and together we have decided to take more time to create a more feature and content-rich experience," they wrote. "While this does mean that you all have to wait a little longer to get your hands on Khiimori, it also means we’ll be able to make sure you get a better game when we do release into Early Access."</p><p>Alongside fleshing Khiimori out with extra features, Aesir say their "main priorities" include improving "player guidance and world experience", as well as the camera, controls, and interface. They also plan to make some performance tweaks to help the game run a bit more smoothly and lower its fairly lofty minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>To help tide the bronco busters of the Steam corral over, the game's Next Fest demo has stuck around past the conclusion of the great demopocalypse and won't disappear until November 30th. So, if like me you've not had a chance to give it a go yet, there's an extra month or so to find a saddle.</p>
<p>I am keen to try it, though, despite not being a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> enjoyer. There's something in its description of breeding and caring for a steed as you negotiate delivery routes you've plotted out, occasionally stopping to forage or shoot a thing with your bow, that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s wilderness-wandering. Or, like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> with mares instead of Mack lorries.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can find The Legend of Khiimori's lingering demo if you gallop over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697000/The_Legend_of_Khiimori/">Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>The sample shows off some gorgeous concept art from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>. We get a glimpse at Samus' Phazon Suit, Dark Samus, Meta Ridley, Metroid Prime itself, and various enemies and environments from the trilogy.</p>
<p>Of course, the full book, created by Piggyback and retailing for <strong>£39.99 / $49.99 / C$69.99</strong>, contains a total of 212 pages, so this is merely an appetiser for the main course. It'll include an introduction from series producer Kensuke Tanabe, writing straight from Retro Studios to introduce each game, and a whole bunch of producer notes to give context to the visuals.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The art book's release comes ahead of two <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> amiibo on November 6th: 'Samus' and 'Samus &amp; Vi-O-La'. The third and final amiibo, 'Sylux', lands on 4th December alongside the game itself on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced over eight years ago (!) at E3 2017 before development was restarted from scratch in 2019. It was subsequently announced in 2024 with the subtitle 'Beyond' and its debut gameplay trailer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-developer-doesn%E2%80%99t-close-the-door-to-dlc.1330099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Ghost of Yōtei is out, Sucker Punch's Jason Connell, who co-directed the game alongside Nate Fox, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Game Informer</a> to discuss the game and characters at length. Eventually, the interviewer also inquired about the possibility of the game getting a DLC, and Connell did not close the door to the idea:</p>



<p><em>I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what's resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu. And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these. [...] You get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn't or what are the holes. And I think that's the mode that you want to be in. And that's sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it's a great character. And just like with Jin, if there's rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we'll certainly take a hard look at that for sure.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Ghost of Tsushima received a DLC called Iki Island, which was released about a year after the base game and was also part of the Director's Cut launch on PS5. In this DLC, protagonist Jin Sakai departs to the titular island to stop a Mongol tribe led by a shaman named Ankhsar Khatun. The expansion is similar in size to Act One of the main game, and players can access it once they have reached Act Two of the main story. Besides the new story, Iki Island also introduced new combat skills, such as the ability to charge at enemies on horseback and new side quests and open-world activities, like visiting animal sanctuaries, where Jin can pet various animals.</p>



<p>If Ghost of Yōtei receives a DLC, it will likely be similar, at least in scope. Of course, much will depend on the reception of the base game, but that's already going pretty well. Sony hasn't shared sales data yet, but we know from Alinea Analytics that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is selling almost as quickly as its predecessor</a>, which had the advantage of a much larger install base (not to mention being released during COVID-19's lockdowns).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts has announced that The Sims Mobile will be shut down after more than seven years of operations and updates. The all-mobile product will be closed down from Janaury 20, 2026, and as it’s an online title, it’ll no longer be accessible to any users.</p>



<p>The team revealed a stack of limited-time events coming in the next few weeks to usher in the closure of the game, but today, October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from app stores.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-sims-mobile-is-the-latest-ea-game-to-go">The Sims Mobile is the Latest EA Game to Go</h2>



<p>Electronic Arts has busied itself closing down servers and shutting down games across a range of genres in the last couple of years. The Sims Mobile is the latest title to be hit by that action.</p>



<p>In March 2018, The Sims Mobile was released by Electronic Arts, and by September, it had pulled in almost 50 million users and racked up more than $20 million in revenue.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>, the team at Electronic Arts confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(On October 20) the final update for The Sims Mobile will be available to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. From this date forward, players will no longer be able to purchase packs or spend real money within TSM. Any existing SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can still be used until January 20, 2026.</p>



<p>In the final update, releasing on October 20th, 2025, everyone will receive unlimited energy to help them make the most of this time. This should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s now a list of special events that will unravel leading up to when the game is taken offline:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Start Time</th><th>End Time</th></tr><tr><td>Eerie Autumn</td><td>Festival Pass</td><td>Oct 20</td><td>Dec 19</td></tr><tr><td>Cozier Home</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Oct 20</td><td>Nov 2</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #1</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Oct 27</td><td>Nov 3</td></tr><tr><td>Hallways Ready</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Nov 3</td><td>Nov 16</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #2</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Nov 10</td><td>Nov 17</td></tr><tr><td>Foxbury Institute</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Nov 17</td><td>Nov 30</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #3</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Nov 24</td><td>Dec 1</td></tr><tr><td>Season’s Greetings</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Dec 1</td><td>Dec 14</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #4</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Dec 8</td><td>Dec 15</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Holiday</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Dec 15</td><td>Dec 28</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #5</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Dec 22</td><td>Dec 29</td></tr><tr><td>New Year’s Dock and Roll</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Dec 29</td><td>Jan 10</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #6</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Jan 1</td><td>Jan 8</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #7</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Jan 10</td><td>Jan 17</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>In the FAQs section on the above blog post, it was noted that any remaining in-game currencies, purchased or otherwise, will not be made refundable. If you’ve invested any money in The Sims Mobile and have a wallet with any cash in it, now’s the time to spend it.</p>

<p>It won't be updated "in time for the main game's release"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> got a Switch 2 demo a few weeks ago, and it's raised some concerns about the performance of the game on Nintendo's new hybrid platform, with players reporting all sorts of issues about the frame rate.</p>
<p>While the eShop showed the game operating at 30FPS, there were seemingly some frame rate hiccups. Fortunately, Atlus is aware, and it seems the experience will be improved in a "future patch" for the main game.</p>
<p>General producer Yoshihiro Komori acknowledged this during a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-have-absolutely-no-intention-of-neglecting-her-persona-3-reload-devs-on-femc-and-porting-to-switch-2">recent interview with Nintendo Life</a>, but also noted how it wouldn't be ready in time for the full game launch this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life:</strong> The demo that was recently released on the Switch 2 eShop shows the game running at 30FPS, but with some frame rate hiccups. Is the team hoping to have those problems worked out for the final release of the game?</p>
<p><strong>Yoshihiro Komori:</strong> "We are currently taking steps to improve this. Since careful QA is required, it was difficult to address this in time for the main game’s release but will be in future patches."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, these improvements won't happen overnight, but there will be an update for this in a future patch. Be on the lookout for our full review of this title later today. It also details the game's performance on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>And if you want to try out this demo for yourself, head on over to the Switch eShop and download it now. Save data will also carry over to the full version.</p>

<p>Ahead of the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> later this year, why not take a trip to the past with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> jams?</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Game Boy in 1991/92, and now the entire soundtrack is available to listen to on the Switch Online Nintendo Music app. As usual, you'll need to be an active subscriber if you want to listen to these songs on this app.</p>
<p>All up, there are a total of 19 tracks, with the entire album length apparently a 30-minute runtime.</p>

<p>This particular album joins existing Metroid titles on the Nintendo Music app service including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, and the original NES and Famicom Metroid albums.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sonic-team-takashi-iizuka-interview/">Polygon at the Brasil Game Show</a> recently, the series producer Takashi Iizuka mentioned how DLC could potentially stretch beyond a year. It all depends on how much attention the game is getting from fans and the feedback the team is receiving.</p>
<p>Here's exactly what he had to say, noting how Sonic Team is also open to requests - from characters to other in-game adjustments:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ugzolj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People really like the game, which gives us the confidence to continue making more content...If enough people are coming in and playing it, there's conversations about the game. We have one year of DLC, we could do year two, we could do year three of DLC... Tell us what you want!.. These are the things we can do because it is an online game. We could add new gadgets, we could balance the game differently.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of things like new DLC, Sega has also today announced the next free character update for this title will be arriving this week on <strong>22nd October 2025</strong>. In case you missed it, it's Joker from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona</a> series, along with a new themed festival.</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out now on the Switch and will arrive later this year on the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a year it has been for <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/ninja-gaiden" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden</em></a>, one of the most beloved franchises in the action genre.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus" rel="nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>&nbsp;</em>was released in January and served as a gripping remaster for a beloved game. This summer saw the release of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a>, an outstanding homage to the franchise's roots. With&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, this marks the finale of the Year of the Ninja.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/platinum-games" rel="nofollow">PlatinumGames</a> at the helm in collaboration with <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/team-ninja" rel="nofollow">Team Ninja</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/koei-tecmo" rel="nofollow">Koei Tecmo</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>is a bombastic gorefest. The action is more visceral than ever as you slash through armored warriors, vicious demons, and terrible fiends in a relentless fury. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is a shot of adrenaline, and I can't get enough of it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-yakumo.jpg?itok=2buy8Pzk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-yakumo.jpg?itok=ezV7fQ47 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to get bloody.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is Action In Its Purest Form</h2>

<p>I'll just get to the point, because&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;doesn't hold back from throwing players right into the fray. The gameplay is electric. It's fast-paced, unrelenting, and is exactly the evolution fans of the series yearned for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is a shot of adrenaline, and I can't get enough of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>is an action game through and through, focusing almost purely on the minute-by-minute gameplay of racking up combos, slashing through foes with sick moves, and dominating the battlefield (or dying despite your best efforts).&nbsp;</p>

<p>You play as Yakumo of the Raven Clan, an expert fighter, and the main character of this entry. Ryu takes a bit of a backseat; though, we'll talk about him in a bit. Yakumo starts with the Takeminakata, duel katanas that cut swiftly and severely into his foes. This is your starter weapon, but as you progress, several more weapons unlock.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-fighting.jpg?itok=-6h9Hg9d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-fighting.jpg?itok=tGOo4TMe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sick flip, Yakumo.</figcaption></figure><p>Additional weapons in the roster include the Yatousen, a speedy, rapier-like lance; Magatsuhi, a swift and sweeping staff perfect for taking out groups of enemies; and Kage-Hiruko, a box that contains a menagerie of iconic ninja tools.</p>

<p>This weapon roster might seem smaller compared to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 3</em>, but each of these four weapons feels diverse and has a complexity that requires mastering to tap into their full potential.</p>

<p>You'll also unlock new abilities for each weapon that use simple inputs, like flicking the joystick in a circle and pressing light or heavy attack. Weapon XP is accrued as you fight through encounters and complete missions, so there's a nice feeling of progression both in your own skill with these weapons and through the unlocking of these new moves.&nbsp;</p>

Yakumo, in the hands of a dedicated player, is an unrelenting stream of savage blows in between dodges and flips.</p>

<p>The sheer brutality of combat is emphasized by the dismemberment of enemies. Often, cutting off a limb doesn't mean they're down and out, so you can use Obliteration technique with the touch of a button to execute them. Combine that with the series' iconic Ultimate Technique (an overwhelmingly powerful flurry of blows used by charging heavy attack), and I couldn't get enough of slicing through foes.</p>

<p>Of course, being a master ninja is easier said than done. Most enemies are capable foes, even the weaker ones, if you're not careful, and <em>especially </em>when they come in droves. Each weapon is more than sufficient to use on its own, but switching between them in the heat of battle is seamless and often the difference between life and death.</p>

Add in Bloodraven Form, and things get even more interesting. See, Yakumo, as a Raven Clan ninja, can transform his weapons with Bloodraven Form, so in fact,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;ends up having something like eight weapons.</p>

<p>Using Bloodraven Form transforms your current weapon into a wholly new one. Holding down the left trigger allows you to enter this state and utilizes a finite resource that accrues as you fight. Thus, each move in the Bloodraven Form requires some of that resource but is more powerful than your average attack.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A lot of enemies in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;utilize guards, and the only way to penetrate through that armor is with a powerful attack. A normal attack from any of your weapons will bounce off guarding enemies and make you vulnerable, so using the Bloodraven Form is the solution that breaks through that tough armor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-ninja-bombs1.jpg?itok=z0Mtd64j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-4-ninja-bombs1.jpg?itok=pGRbEWhW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ninja bombs? Why not!</figcaption></figure><p>As for the weapons' new transformations, our duel swords become one single, sweeping katana that can take out groups of enemies in a wide area. The rapier turns into a drill that, when holding down attacks, allows you to spin it and rearrange enemies' guts, no matter how powerful they might be. The Kage-Hiruko, that box of ninja tools, throws empowered katanas with its light attack and uses even more powerful ninja tools with the heavy ones that can be strengthened by releasing your inputs at the right time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My personal favorite is the staff, the Magatsuhi. This turns into a giant hammer and really emphasized the depth of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>'s gameplay when it comes to its weapons. The hammer is slow but powerful, and similar to the Kage-Hiruko, releasing the input at certain moments in your combos allows it to explode and deal even more damage.</p>

<p>Mastering&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>'s weapons was a gratifying experience, but I'm not going to claim I'm an expert with them. It's just getting the timing down for the hammer was a bit weird at first, but once it clicked, it was an extremely potent tool in my arsenal and absolutely tore up the battlefield.</p>

<p>I can just imagine someone more skillful than me going ham with the different weapons, switching between them in the midst of combat to formulate unstoppable combos. The Bloodraven Form of these weapons adds so much to the gameplay, so it's such a blast to use them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bloodraven Form really is just the tip of the iceberg for&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>&nbsp;<em>4</em>'s combat. There are so many techniques and moves to purchase through your NinjaCoins to enhance your moveset even further. Parries, perfect dodges, the Izuna freakin' Drop, and more are unlockable as techniques, much to the delight of action fans.&nbsp;</p>

While in this state, you can unleash one giant attack that takes out large groups of enemies in a single hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trust me, you're going to need every single tool to win in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. The difficulty on Normal felt just right to start that steadily ramps up as it throws more enemies and challenges your way. Moving on to the new hardest difficulty made me appreciate how far my skills have come, though I'm still not ready for Master Ninja just yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not a spoiler to say you also play as Ryu in&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;-- it's in the marketing material. Though, don't go expecting him to be the main character here, that's Yakumo. Ryu is playable for several chapters, however, and it's nice to step into the shoes of the genre's greatest hero.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ryu has his own moves and skills separate from Yakumo, so both play and feel distinct. Ryu's moveset operates more like the traditional&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>we know and love; it's hard to describe how, exactly, but playing as him felt closer to <em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>&nbsp;than Yakumo, no doubt. In this case, he uses just one weapon, but has four different Ninpo spells fans should recognize, including but not limited to a powerful fire attack that targets multiple enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ryu_ninja-gaiden-4-2.jpg?itok=QbLQWCgA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ryu_ninja-gaiden-4-2.jpg?itok=-xP-2SB8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A master ninja doing what a master ninja does.</figcaption></figure><p>Ryu doesn't use Bloodraven form, but he still has a resource that allows him to tap into other attacks. This is called Gleam Form, allowing Ryu to unleash these kinetic, super-fast slashes that break through armor and deal tons of damage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your time as Ryu is brief, and it's probably best that way. He plays fine enough, it's just that the segments featuring Ryu retread previous levels you played as Yakumo. You even fight the same bosses, and they're not even different than the first time you fought them. These levels could have used more variation, but it almost comes across as padding the game's length.</p>

<p>Before I dive deeper into bosses, I want to commend&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;for its enemy variety.&nbsp;I like dealing with a diverse roster of baddies to cut through since it requires me to adapt on the fly, and facing off against humans, demons, and fiends means each encounter has something new.</p>

<p>This variety also means&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;has a few annoying, pesky enemies that break up the flow.&nbsp;Mainly, it's these flying lanterns that lob ranged attacks at you. Before they die, they charge into you and try to explode. When you're dealing with multiple of these, it's just a huge nuisance.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/boss-ninja-gaiden-41.jpg?itok=nfFrCpXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/boss-ninja-gaiden-41.jpg?itok=xiD2meGD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ah hell, what in tarnation am I about to fight.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>There are a couple more enemies like this, and most of them use range-based attacks. I suppose the solution to this is to "git gud," but compared to the rest of the enemy roster, they're more infuriating than intimidating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boss fights are, similarly, a hit or miss. Some of these bosses are just tanky as all hell and feel like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-souls" rel="nofollow">Dark Souls</a>&nbsp;</em>bosses, with these wide, sweeping attacks that, like those lanterns, are more annoying than difficult to deal with.&nbsp;The smaller bosses -- and I really do mean more human-sized -- are much more fun and exciting to fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tokyo rains blood. The Dark Dragon's corpse bleeds a toxic rain over Tokyo, leading the once prosperous metropolis into disarray. The only way to save this city is to revive the Dark Dragon and slay it once more; though, as prophesied, only a Raven Clan ninja can purge this monstrosity for good.</p>

<p>Thus, our hero Yakumo sets out to unseal the Dark Dragon, revive it, and fulfill his destiny. The Divine Dragon Order (DDO), a paramilitary group of "peacekeepers," stands in his way, as does Ryu Hayabusa and a number of fiends and demons. With the help of his clan, as well as a priestess named Seori, perhaps Tokyo can be saved.</p>

The story acts more as a vessel to throw players into cool situations against the DDO, demons, fiends, and the like. Really, what&nbsp;the story lacks is strong characters. Yakumo, despite being our protagonist, is monotone.</p>

<p>Yakumo's a badass ninja, don't get me wrong, but he's too one-note. He doesn't really have a personality, or at least there isn't enough time for the story to develop one. He has an affinity for priestesses, though I'm not sure why, since there aren't many face-to-face interactions with them together. With just a few other side characters, I didn't feel any connection for Yakumo, his clan members, or Seori. It was nice to see Ryu because that's Ryu freakin' Hayabusa, but he's not the main focus here anyway.</p>

<p>The whole time I was playing&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, I couldn't get over how&nbsp;<em>awesome</em>&nbsp;the soundtrack was. Having a good track to go along with your fight is essential in an action game, and few do it as good as&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. Thinking about my favorite boss fights, I get chills, and part of that is because of the music. A lot of the OST has this hard rock or post-metal feel, and when the vocals start playing, I&nbsp;<em>locked in</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found myself going back to these fights just to hear the music, and thankfully, it's quite easy to fight previous bosses. Post-game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>&nbsp;offers a hefty amount of content, like replaying bosses and levels on higher difficulties to get a high score.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The post-game Trials will put your skills to the test as it throws you into unique scenarios as either Yakumo or Ryu. Trials might, for instance, restrict the use of Bloodraven form or Gleam, while others might mean one hit from an enemy, and you're dead. Even though it's a single-player game, I feel compelled to get better, hone my skills, and complete these trials just to prove something to myself.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-quietly-clears-out-the-supersonic-salon-grade-hair-dryer-now-going-for-peanuts.1330000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson built its reputation on mastering airflow in vacuum cleaners so jumping into hair dryers might seem like an odd pivot until you realize it’s the exact same engineering challenge. The Supersonic Origin applies that airflow expertise to drying hair faster and with less heat damage than traditional dryers that basically just blast hot air at your head.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">has dropped this powerful tool to $299, down from its usual $419 price</a>, which marks an all-time low for a device that rarely sees discounts. If you’ve been frustrated with frizzy results or spending 20 minutes blow-drying your hair, this deal makes switching to professional-grade technology affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the Supersonic Different From Your Average Dryer</h2>
<p>The Supersonic Origin places the <strong>motor at the handle instead of the head and</strong> entirely alters the balance and handling. Classic hair dryers place a cumbersome motor at the top and cause your arm to tire within minutes and producing that unpleasant weight distribution. Dyson’s V9 <strong>digital motor rotates at 110,000 rpm</strong> which is ridiculously quick next to standard dryers that top at 20,000 rpm. The fast motor drives 13 liters per second through the barrel and produces a concentrated, high-velocity airbeam that dries hair internally, not roasting the top.</p>
<p>Its smart heat control system<strong> takes air temperature readings 40 times per second</strong> and transmits the readings to a microprocessor that controls the heating element. The result is that the <strong>air temperature never goes above 302°F</strong> and that’s important because hair damage takes off at a very rapid rate above that temperature. Drugstore dryers are not very temperature-controlled at all and can easily reach 350-400°F and they fry the protective cuticle layer on your hair. The Supersonic controls temperatures evenly, so your hair dries fast without the crispy, damaged feel that so often comes from the intense heat.</p>



<p>This Supersonic model comes with the necessary attachments that will suit the majority of daily styling requirements. The concentrator for styling allows for a focused airflow for smooth and controlled drying and is ideal when using a round brush to add volume. The wide tooth comb attachment is ideal for hair that is coily, curly, or highly textured, and enables curl drying and lengthening at the same time without interfering with the natural form. The diffused air attachment is for fine hair or sensitive scalps that cannot tolerate strong direct heat.</p>
<p>These are actual airflow and heat settings, not the typical low-medium-high. You get<strong> three real speed settings with four heat settings</strong> and a cold shot button that sets your style with the closure of the cuticle on your hair. The cold shot is not a gimmick: it seals the hydrogen bonds of your hair at the completion of heat styling, and your blowout will last longer.</p>



<p>The acoustic engineering deserves mention because loud hair dryers are genuinely annoying, especially if you’re drying your hair early in the morning with roommates or family around. Dyson tuned the motor frequency to an inaudible pitch and then added acoustic silencers to further reduce noise. The <strong>result measures at 79 decibels which is noticeably quieter than most professional dryers</strong> that scream at 85-90 decibels. That 6-10 decibel difference translates to roughly half the perceived loudness, making the experience far more pleasant.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying roughly three times the price of an entry-level dryer at $299 but the technology is so good that it’s really worth it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In so many ways, Ninja Gaiden 4 is exactly what I wanted it to be. It’s a collaborative effort between Team Ninja and Platinum Games, two of my all time favorite developers; it builds off the combat from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/26/ninja-gaiden-ii-review">Ninja Gaiden 2</a>, which has the best action of the series in my eyes; and it comes packed with small touches that make it a bit more approachable without sacrificing the tough-as-nails difficulty that longtime fans like me expect. But while I’d even go so far as to say this combat system is among the very best I’ve ever seen, Ninja Gaiden 4 stumbles in many other areas – from its bland new lead character, to its uninspired level design, to its predictable story that falls completely flat. The action is still so good that a lot of those shortcomings get deflected like bullets against Ryu Hayabusa’s sword, but others slip through that defense and wound what is otherwise an incredible revival for the Master Ninja.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story has never been a selling point of the Ninja Gaiden series, so it didn’t come as a surprise to me that Ninja Gaiden 4’s plot was one of its weakest elements. It introduces us to our new protagonist, Yakumo, a skilled ninja of the Raven Clan whose initial goal to kill a priestess of the Dark Dragon instead quickly turns into a mission to escort her to a handful of magic seals in an effort to really for realsies kill the Dark Dragon for good this time. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 4 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What follows is an extremely predictable 10-hour campaign with attempts at big emotional moments that fall flat because the legwork to make you care about these characters is never done. There is some banter that happens between Yakumo, his handler, and the other members of his little Raven Clan squad, but it’s never charming or endearing, and certainly never develops to a point where I ever got a real sense that these characters were actually close. Yakumo primarily communicates with grunts, growls, acknowledgements of the mission objectives, and angry threats, and as a result just comes off as a lame edgelord most of the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do get to play a couple of chapters as Ryu toward the end, and while these are a welcome reprieve, they also feel like a huge missed opportunity. His levels have him retracing Yakumo’s steps, fighting through the same environments, mostly the same enemies, and the same bosses, but this time with fewer combat options since Ryu only has access to one weapon, a far less interesting Gleam Form to replace Yakumo’s Bloodraven Form, and just four returning Ninpo super attacks. Imagine Dante’s missions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/04/devil-may-cry-4-review-2">Devil May Cry 4</a>, except he doesn’t get any new weapons, his playstyle is almost exactly the same as Nero, and there’s none of the cool Dante trash talk. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ninja Gaiden 4's combat isn't just good, it's phenomenal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I am willing to forgive an action game for <em>a lot </em>if the action itself is good, and fortunately Ninja Gaiden 4’s combat isn’t just good, it’s phenomenal. It’s incredibly fast, the enemies are intelligent and won’t let you do the same thing over and over again, there’s a great deal of flexibility that allows you to change up your approach to each fight, it looks slick as hell, and it has that trademark Team Ninja fluidity mixed with the over-the-top craziness that Platinum Games is renowned for. It just checks every single box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The secret sauce here is enemy aggression. Enemies are absolutely <em>ruthless </em>in Ninja Gaiden 4. They don’t politely wait their turn as they attack from off screen, hit you with unblockables, grab you if you try to turtle up, armor through your regular attacks, and overwhelm you with sheer numbers. It’s a style of combat that is totally unique to this series, and that suffocating pressure from enemies is what makes every combat encounter such a thrilling fight for survival. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that may sound brutal, but Yakumo’s own toolset is extremely powerful as well. You have the iconic Flying Swallow technique that allows you to zip towards an enemy, potentially slicing their head off in just a single hit; the Izuna Drop air combo that ends in a flying piledriver that will instantly kill most enemies in a single blow; the plethora of powerful unlockable attacks for each weapon; and most importantly, ultimate techniques that let you absorb essence from defeated enemies to charge up a flashy combo that is completely invulnerable, can hit multiple enemies, and does extremely high damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is new to Ninja Gaiden 4, and in fact is just a basic overview of what’s always been great about the combat in this series. But it’s important to talk about because my biggest concern coming into Ninja Gaiden 4 was that it would feel less like Ninja Gaiden and more like a Platinum Games game – not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just not what I’d want out of a return I’ve been waiting 13 years for. Fortunately, that’s not the case. This is a Ninja Gaiden game through and through with a light touch of Platinum flavor to enhance it even further.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is Ninja Gaiden through and through with a light touch of Platinum flavor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That flavor mostly comes in the form of one big addition to the combat system: Yakumo’s Bloodraven Form. By holding down the left trigger, Yakumo will transform his weapon into a slower, more extravagant version with a completely new set of moves and the ability to break an enemy’s guard or interrupt their super attacks. These attacks are sick as hell, and definitely bring to mind some of Bayonetta’s Wicked Weave heavy attacks, especially the Rapier that turns into a huge drill, or the staff that turns into a giant hammer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more than being cool to look at, they add a new dimension to combat that forces you to be reactive to how the enemies are dealing with your offense. If you go into autopilot and spam light attacks, enemies will block your strikes and deliver a damaging counter of their own. But if you notice that they’re flashing white and shrugging off your attacks, you can hit them with a Bloodraven Form attack to not only deal big damage, but also open them up to even more punishment after breaking their guard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodraven Form moves are tied to a meter that drains pretty quickly, adding an extra layer of resource management I enjoyed. These blood infused attacks are also generally pretty slow, which makes them a bit risky to try and interrupt a faster armored attack. So you need to decide whether to risk wasting your meter by pre-emptively using a blood attack to try and catch an armored move during its initial animation, whether to risk your health by trying to wait and react to one of their slower and more telegraphed armored moves, or or whether to use the meter defensively instead to try and perfectly block otherwise unblockable techniques. Whatever the case, having multiple different options to deal with a challenging combat encounter is crucial in a game like this, and Ninja Gaiden 4 is stacked with options to play around with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One departure from previous games is that instead of individually upgrading your weapons and having each improvement come with new moves and increased power, this time around you must buy all of your upgrades a la carte. Universal upgrades that affect every weapon cost Ninja Coin, which is a currency gained primarily from completing side missions, optional Purgatory challenges, and as a reward for completing a chapter. Weapon specific techniques on the other hand must be purchased with Weapon EXP, which is gained simply by fighting enemies. The better you perform, the more Weapon EXP you get. I enjoyed always having something new to unlock the whole way through, even though I do think Ninja Gaiden 4 is a little stingy with your starting set of upgrades. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/master-ninja-gameplay1-1760985620521.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">I'm not gonna sugar coat it: X, Y, X, X, X, Y</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re not even able to absorb essence to instantly charge your ultimate technique, quickly charge it after landing from a jump, or even charge it up to level two by default. All of those techniques have to be purchased, along with staples like the aforementioned Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop<em>. And </em>that same currency is also used to purchase consumable items, leading to a brutal economy in the early going. Especially if you didn’t purchase the Deluxe Edition, which gifts players with a whopping 50,000 Ninja Coins right from the start. That’s enough to buy virtually every starting upgrade and fill up your inventory. If you only have the standard edition, the first couple of hours can be pretty rough as you slowly build up the arsenal of techniques that bring Ninja Gaiden 4’s combat to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final new combat wrinkle is the addition of a Berserk Meter that fills up as you deal or take damage, as well as when you defeat delimbed enemies with Obliteration Techniques. When the Berserk Meter is full, your charged-up Bloodraven Form attacks will trigger Bloodbath Kills, which are basically cinematic one-hit kills. It’s another fun element of resource management that gave me a way to satisfyingly clear a whole screen of tough enemies in just a few seconds, if I managed to survive long enough to be able to build up the meter.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Berserk Meter adds another fun element of resource management.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Platinum also injects a healthy dose of style and creative expression into the combat by giving Yakumo the ability to hot swap between his weapons with just the press of a button. So you can do cool things like launch an enemy with the dual swords, hit them twice in the air, switch to another weapon, hit them twice again, switch to a third weapon, max out that air combo, and then send them crashing down with an Izuna Drop. We’re not talking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review">Devil May Cry</a> levels of potential for combo creativity, but there’s still a lot of fancy stuff you can do between the many techniques that you’ll unlock for each weapon, and there’s even a training mode so you can practice optimizing your damage and stylish combos. Variety like this goes a long way for me in terms of making combat feel fresh and exciting throughout the entire campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did my first playthrough of Ninja Gaiden 4 on Hard, and while that was the sweet spot in terms of difficulty for me, it’s worth noting that you can change this setting at any point (except in Master Ninja mode), which is a great feature for anyone struggling with its demanding challenges. Hero mode has been added as well which allows you to enable auto-block and auto-dodge at low health, along with an auto-assist that allows you to do damaging combos with just single button presses. It’s not for me, but I appreciate its inclusion nonetheless as a way to let more people enjoy the spectacle and action of the Ninja Gaiden series. </p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the action is pristine and the combat arenas themselves have some great interactable elements that give you the freedom to zip around from point to point, cutting up enemies along the way, the actual level design is pretty uninspired. There are occasional splashes of interesting architecture across the futuristic version of Tokyo that’s been twisted by the evil power of the Dark Dragon’s husk, but far more often you’ll just be wandering around very bland rooftops, identical looking corridors, and boring city streets. It doesn’t get much better once you’re out of Tokyo, either. You just trade those drab streets for foggy cliffsides, ugly sewers, and samey looking military bases. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple of fun travel sequences that break up all of the limb liberating sword slashing, like Sonic-esque rail grinding sections, bits where you have to glide on wind currents to soar over a mountain range, and some sewer surfing, but they’re repeated throughout the campaign with little to no variation or evolution. As a result, they end up feeling more like filler than anything else. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While the action is pristine, the actual level design is pretty uninspired.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new sidequest system that allows you to gain some extra currency by completing optional tasks, like finding and defeating secret minibosses, capturing hidden collectible monsters called Gourdies, or just simply defeating a certain number of enemies in a specific area. It’s a nice addition that gives extra incentive to be thorough and not just run past optional fights, even though the drab and exceptionally linear level design doesn’t make it very exciting to actually explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite thing to find hidden in a level though are the Purgatory Gates. These are optional challenge rooms with the cool twist of letting you decide how much health you want to attempt them with. The greater the health handicap, the greater the reward. These fights are by far the most intense and most fun challenges available, and I loved pushing myself to try and get through the hardest difficulty and then being handsomely rewarded for the effort. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Top Action Games</h3><p>The best games in my favorite genre</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bosses have never been a strong suit for the Ninja Gaiden series but, funny enough, have always been a strength of Platinum Games. The mixture of the two seems to have gone about how you would expect, as the bosses in Ninja Gaiden 4 vary wildly in quality. There are a couple of truly great scraps against tough enemies with adrenaline pumping soundtracks that brought to mind some of Metal Gear Rising’s best fights. Meanwhile, others are just underwhelming battles against giant monsters with too much health and some frustrating gimmicks – from bosses that obnoxiously teleport around a large arena whenever you get close, to giant fiends that spawn annoying fodder enemies to distract from their own extremely dangerous attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After beating the campaign, you unlock the Master Ninja difficulty, the ability to replay any stage, boss, or unlocked Purgatory Gate as either Yakumo or Ryu, and most substantially, 18 combat trials that feature unique modifiers and even a few enemies that I never encountered in the main game. These combat trials might have you clearing waves of enemies without using your Bloodraven Form or cause your health to tick down continuously, forcing you to balance using your ultimate technique to clear out enemies while also making sure to occasionally pick up the life-restoring orbs that are used to quickly charge it – or a trial might just prevent you from healing all together. I haven’t beaten all of these yet, but I am having a blast going through each of them and look forward to challenging my friends to top my scores on the leaderboards. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When the first 3D <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> came out on Xbox in 2004, I <em>really</em> wanted to play it; though the game looks a little antiquated now, at the time, teenage me thought that ninja protagonist Ryu Hayabusa was cool as hell. But alas, I didn’t have an Xbox, and I don’t think I could have convinced my parents to let me get such a (for the time) violent game. Even as an adult that could buy whatever game I wanted, I never got around to playing the franchise. Twenty-one years later, I’ve finally scratched that itch.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> stars a new character named Yakumo instead of Ryu. Yakumo is a total punk; imagine someone with the short, unaffected personality of <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s Cloud Strife but as an extremely capable and acrobatic ninja who always wears a mask and has hair that sweeps across his face. It’s silly, but it works for such an over-the-top action game. And his personality helps me internally justify the way <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> encourages aggressive, in-your-face fighting.</p><p>You have a light and a heavy attack that you can mash to strike your enemies, and well-timed dodges help get you in the right position to keep up your barrage. You can unlock new skills and moves that require certain button combinations, but I almost never consciously used them and usually relied on the standard attacks. As you fight, you’ll also build up energy to be able to switch into a “Ravenbound” mode with stronger attacks that can stagger enemies.</p><p>After you do enough damage to an enemy, they’ll get dismembered and then, with one tap of your heavy attack, you can go in for a powerful finishing move with a satisfyingly gruesome animation. I never got tired of seeing Yakumo turn one of my weapons into a vicious drill and jump on it to kill enemies. While ridiculous, it all makes sense given that the game is co-developed by action game experts Team Ninja and PlatinumGames. At times, I felt like I was playing a <em>Bayonetta</em> game, which is a compliment.</p><p>The absurdity goes beyond the battles, too. When you’re not fighting off waves of enemies, you’ll traverse the game’s levels by running along walls, leaping from poles with a grappling hook, grinding on rails, catching wind currents to fly through the air, and surfing across the water. There’s even a part where you’ll do all that while zipping through interdimensional portals. Between the fights and the traversal, there’s almost always something interesting happening as you’re running around the world, and when you need a break from the action or to restock your items, the in-game shops tend to be placed right where you need them.</p><p>I was constantly flying at enemies, keeping up the pressure with flurries of weapon strikes, and jumping around levels like the <em>coolest ninja ever</em>. There are even parts of the game where <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/07/ninja-gaiden-4-deep-immersive-allure/">you can play as Ryu</a>, who has his own style of play that’s slightly different from Yakumo’s — though I actually liked playing as him less because his heroic personality is so much more boring than Yakumo’s emo vibe.</p><p>Despite the chaotic action, the game has a relatively basic, old-school structure. Generally, you’ll play through a few levels, take on a major boss, acquire a new weapon, and rinse and repeat. There’s no open world, which helps keep things focused, though a few areas give you a tad more leeway to explore. While the back third of the game takes a bit of a step down because of some repeated levels and boss fights, I appreciated how straightforward it all was.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is one of my favorite action games I’ve played in years, and it’s the game I always imagined that the original 3D <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> would be. I didn’t feel like I missed anything by jumping in so late in the franchise. And there’s a lot of great <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games to play next: I loved this year’s excellent new 2D entry, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/716421/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-nintendo-switch-playstation-xbox-pc"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a>, and to really get some of that old-school 3D vibe, there’s a new <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/">remaster of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> for modern consoles</a>, too. After two decades of waiting, now I have lots of catching up to do.</p><div><p><sup>Ninja Gaiden 4<em> will be released <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1978173973117501750">on October 20th at 8PM ET</a> on Xbox Series X / S, PS5, and PC.</em></sup></p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/802755/ninja-gaiden-4-review-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2006, then-PlayStation CEO Kaz Hirai made one of the most memorable on-stage presentations in video game history, talking his way through a lengthy PSP loading wait by uttering the classic line "Riiiiidge Raaaaacer".</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="It's Ridge Racer!" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaBUeINW_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Part of a wider PlayStation presentation that can charitably be labelled a disaster--<a href="https://kotaku.com/why-was-e3-canceled-when-dates-best-electronic-expo-1704385912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it also included the PS3's "$599" announcement and the "MASSIVE DAMAGE" stuff</a>--what was at the time seen as painfully cringe, ammunition for countless memes, has in time matured into something that's now seen as more of a heartfelt moment, a glimpse of a man who was CEO because he loved <em>Ridge Racer</em> and had spent a long time working at PlayStation, not because he was a Wall Street psychopath obsessed with making a line go up every quarter.</p><p>Like, it's one thing to have been involved in a press conference gaffe, loads of people have done that and we've forgotten all about it. Few video game executives get to see a whole entry<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaz_Hirai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> on their Wikipedia page dedicated to</a> one:</p><blockquote><p>His real name is "Kazuo(一夫)," but he is commonly known by the shortened version, "Kaz." In Japan, he is also affectionately called "Ridge Hirai(リッジ平井)." This nickname comes from the 2006 E3 event, where, during a PSP presentation, he passionately shouted "Riiiiidge Racer!" while demonstrating the game. He is aware of this nickname and even mentions it in his autobiography.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You can tell how much it (and the series!) meant to both Hirai and PlayStation that, in honour of both, Sony reportedly commissioned Nike in 2007 to produce a handful of pairs of Air Max 90 360s emblazoned with the line “Ridge Racer” so they could be presented to their CEO as a gift.<a href="https://kotaku.com/nike-thanks-the-playstation-with-24-pairs-of-shoes-5361127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> These aren't part of the 24 pairs that were reported on in the media in 2009</a>; I'm told they were made just for Hirai, and have only turned up now because one of the pairs are for sale.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/286704613073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">msole</a></figcaption></figure><p>Australian sneaker collector MSOLE--<a href="https://www.instagram.com/msolemichael/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose collection includes stuff like a number of game-worn Jordans</a>, and who has presented at international sneaker conferences--has got his hands on what he says are one of only six pairs ever manufactured, and in procuring them managed to learn a little about them as well.</p><p>He tells me the shoes aren't third-party customs; the tag you see in these images means they were manufactured directly by Nike in a factory in Korea. MSOLE says all six pairs were made in Hirai's size and presented to him as a gift, and that while the former PlayStation CEO kept two pairs, he presented another to a former colleague, while three remaining pairs ended up unaccounted for. Those three are now all in the hands of collectors, with MSOLE owning one and another unnamed person in the USA owning the other two.</p><p>I've reached out to Joe Howley, the man named on the production tag (who was formerly of Nike, and who now works at Under Armor) to see if he could tell me anything else about them, but at time of publishing I haven't heard back.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/286704613073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">msole</a></figcaption></figure><p>I, someone who likes to think I've done a <em>lot </em>of video game x sneaker reporting, had never even heard about these shoes until now! And I only heard about them because<a href="https://elmore.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Friend Of The Site Andrew Elmore</a> tipped me off to<a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/286704613073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the eBay auction selling them</a>, with a 'Buy It Now' price of...AUD$15,000 (which is around USD$10,000 at time of publishing).</p><p>That is a <em>lot </em>of money, bordering on 'fuck you' money, but then these are also extremely rare shoes, both in number and in terms of how they were made; they're so rare that this auction is the only result you get for them on Google, making these a commercial sale <em>and </em>a learning opportunity.</p><p>Which is neat! I don't think any of us are in a position to be putting bids on $10,000 sneakers, but getting the chance to learn about an extremely rare and special pair of PlayStation x <em>Ridge Racer</em> Air Maxs (fast approaching their 20th birthday) for the first time after all these years has been cool.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/nike-playstation-ridge-racer-kaz-hirai]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In a world of gaming dominated by the ever expanding range of Souls-likes, it can be easy to forget that character action used to be king. High octane Japanese game series like Ninja Gaiden used to dominate consoles, but over the years this iconic Team Ninja franchise has steadily faded into irrelevancy. It’s easy to see why, when Ninja Gaiden 3 managed to cater to neither existing fans or newcomers.&nbsp;Whatever spark and soul that entry lacked, Ninja Gaiden 4 makes up for in spades, and it’s an awesome reminder of why the classic action game will never truly die.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Master Ninja Gameplay | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wzqvkh9m8jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Don’t let the numeral in the title fool you – there isn’t any homework or catching-up you need to do in order to get into Ninja Gaiden 4. Part of that is helped by the fact that our perspective has shifted to Yakumo, a new character and a skilled ninja from the Raven Clan. They’ve lived in the shadow of the Hayabusa Clan for ages, but the actions of that clan have led Yakumo and the Raven Clan to pick up the pieces and jump into the spotlight in order to fulfil an ancient prophecy, even if it goes against the plans of Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;hero Ryu Hayabusa himself.</p>


<p>After some very truncated recapping of the events of the series up until now, Ninja Gaiden 4 tosses you into Yakumo’s journey to end the Black Dragon once and for all. As a novice to the franchise, it’s easy to follow along with what’s happening here because so much of the game is focused, first and foremost, on being cool as hell. You’re a super powered cyber ninja in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, and I really don’t need much more explaining than that in order to get into the action. It also helps that the cast of characters you interact with are all pretty fun and flashy, like the snarky shrine maiden Seori. Plus, when Yakumo’s path does cross over with Ryu Hayabusa’s, you feel the weight of this moment and get hyped up!</p>


<p>It’s the gameplay that steals the show in Ninja Gaiden 4, though. When it was revealed that this title was a collaboration between Team Ninja and Platinum Games, I could barely contain my excitement. I was pinching myself at the thought of combining the legacies of these two titans of action gaming, and I was absolutely not disappointed. I am blown away by how perfectly Ninja Gaiden 4 manages to blend the depth and unrelenting difficulty of the franchise with the high-octane, over-the-top flash and fun of Platinum Games. It’s all tied together by an onslaught of wild hyper-violence that’s woven throughout the gameplay and the visuals.</p>
<p>Yakumo dishes out light and heavy attacks, but can also expend his Bloodbind Gauge to enter Bloodraven form and deliver especially strong blows. You’ll slowly build this gauge over time, but if you launch a heavy attack when an enemy is dismembered you’ll perform an instant Obliteration attack that rewards you with a good chunk more. It’s a loop of mechanics that reward you with constantly staying on the offensive, but even your defensive tools are all about attacking. In this game, your parry is the attack button – predict an enemy attack and meet it with your own, and you’ll stagger them instantly. Enemies can bust out super-strong attacks that can’t be parried, but guess what? Interrupt those with a Bloodraven attack and you’ll break their stance and stagger them even harder.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is effectively the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a> of character action games. The entire combat loop is built around forcing you into a dance where every tool in your arsenal is a piece of offensive art, all looping togetherlike a blood-soaked puzzle. As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock multiple weapons, new attack abilities, and weapon-specific bonus attacks for Yakumo. Playing as Ryu Hayabusa, meanwhile, retains all these mechanics but with a simplified arsenal that blends all the best elements of his attack abilities from prior games. Any time I felt myself stuck on a hard fight, having a wealth of other attack abilities and combo strings to experiment with made it so satisfying to bash my head against that wall over and over until I finally made it through.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be quite so hard, though. There’s a wealth of difficulty and accessibility options in Ninja Gaiden 4 that make it easy to fine-tune the experience to meet your skill level and enjoyment. You can swap between base difficulty modes at any time – Hard Mode hurts and even Normal Mode packs a punch, but there’s an easier Hero Mode available that makes a lot of encounters easier without becoming an outright cakewalk. Meanwhile, specific options like auto lock-on behavior, controller remapping, and even a bunch of UI customisation make this one of the most approachable character action games I’ve played. One frustration with no solution was the lack of a truly quick-restart for failed battles. Certain boss fights, side missions and trial encounters had me dying and retrying for ages, and the wait in-between death, loading, and re-entering the arena often frustrated me far more than the difficulty of the fight itself.</p>

<p>Remember that Doom Eternal comparison I made earlier? It extends even deeper into the soundtrack. Every battle and stylish set-piece is paired with energetic music that fits the cyberpunk slaughter vibes perfectly. And in important battles and big boss fights, Ninja Gaiden 4 busts out it’s secret weapon: shredding guitars. The pairing of hyper-violent ninja action with loud, wild guitar is so tapped into the same rule-of-cool energy that made Ninja Gaiden so iconic to start with, and it reminds me of the best of Platinum Games titles, too.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is such a breath of fresh air. Every combat encounter ends with my fingers shaking and my eyes wide, and it’s a thrill that kept me chasing the next one all the way until I finished the game. Unrelenting difficulty combined with jaw-dropping speed and style make for a game that lives up to the pedigree of its franchise, its developers, and the heights of action gaming as a whole.</p>

			<p>2025 has been a killer year for ninjas. Not only have we seen the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/">resurgence of Shinobi</a> developed by the folks at Lizardcube but another Ninja Gaiden title also dropped over the summer from The Game Kitchen. Now, mere days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the untimely passing of the man behind the series reboot on the original Xbox</a>, it’s time for the first new numbered title in the Ninja Gaiden franchise in fourteen years and the first of the modern series to not feature super ninja Ryu Hayabusa front and center. Can PlatinumGames prove they’ve got a mastery of ninjutsu, or is this one adventure a magic trick gone wrong?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Ryu Hayabusa remains a core part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">Ninja Gaiden 4’</a>s narrative, the main focus this time around is on newcomer Yakumo, a rising ninja from the rival Raven Clan. Before Ninja Gaiden 4 opens, it’s a fact that the Dark Dragon is dead (for the third time), felled at the hands of Ryu Hayabusa (again) and its hulking skeletal remains lingering above Tokyo. As supernatural gods are wont to do, the risk of revival is imminent. It’s established early on in the story that this Raven clan has been operating in the shadows nearly as long as the Hayabusa clan, cleaning up after them and clearing a path for the main clan to take all of the glory for success. To quell the possible revival of the Dark Dragon, Yakumo’s initial goal is to slay a blue-eyed priestess to fulfill a prophecy of his clan. However, the pair instead pair up to subvert the prophecy and instead aim to revive the Dark Dragon in hopes of giving one final death and end the cycle of rebirth and destruction. Naturally, this leads to making an enemy of nearly every other ninja clan out there and even Ryu Hayabusa himself.</p>



<p>Without Ryu’s signature Dragon Sword in his arsenal, Yakumo instead relies on a number of other tricks up his short sleeves, starting with a pair of ninja swords and rapidly growing to include a spiral rapier and double-ended staff, among others. Each of these weapons feels dramatically different from one another in combat, some best suited for taking bosses on one-on-one while the likes of the staff are better for crowd control and slaying the dozens of ghost fish that are a staple of annoying Ninja Gaiden players the world over. I would have loved to take the Falcon’s Talons for another walk but every weapon Yakumo acquires fits a certain role in combat without being an all-in-one survival tool.</p>

<p>Yakumo himself isn’t much of an interesting protagonist compared to those who have championed earlier Ninja Gaiden games. He doesn’t speak much, instead blindly following suggestions and goals without question, only for the occasional staredown or sarcastic quip to utter from his lips. Both his fashion sense and mannerisms invoke the edgy Hot Topic teenager going through their goth phase in life, only far more brutal. Yakumo can manifest that angst and anger and channel them into the power of his unique combat style, the Bloodbind Ninjutsu and Bloodraven Form.</p>



<p>As Yakumo attacks, a secondary gauge fills to power his Bloodraven attacks. By holding down L2, he can convert his current weapon into an alternative form or power up his counterattacks. This turns that double-sided staff into a massive hammer with a rocket on the opposite end, while his dual swords can turn into a two-handed sword instead. With how much health a lot of these damage sponge enemies have, not utilizing his Bloodraven form can turn fights into lengthy slogs while even a single attack from an enemy can take off a sizable chunk of life. Further fueling this lust for blood is a mechanic to recover a fraction of health lost by drenching oneself in blood; the downside to this is that even taking a second hit from an enemy before you’ve had a chance to recover often leaves a massive deficit in health that can only be salvaged by using one of the limited healing potions Yakumo carries on him at a time. In far too many fights, I thought I had the edge and could counterattack to win the battle, only to get stopped in my tracks with an annoying pop-up asking if I would like to use the Incense of Rebirth in my inventory and revive on the spot, a sure sign that I screwed something up and died to an unexpected attack.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What PlatinumGames brings to the table in Ninja Gaiden 4 reinvents the fast-paced combat of the modern series with a number of tropes that have been in their earlier games. Players can deflect oncoming attacks with a quick attack of their own, leading to a third defensive option besides just blocking or dodging away. This is best used for fights where it’s just one-on-one and the player can be able to read and anticipate the attack from a single direction. When surrounded by enemies and attacks coming from all sides, taking a less risky approach is often the best choice (albeit with fights taking much longer without that aggression at play).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Series staple moves that Ryu Hayabusa pioneered, from the Flying Swallow attack in the air to the Guillotine Throw against humanoid enemies, are all part of Yakumo’s stable of moves, provided you spend the coin at one of the local merchants to learn the ways of the super ninja. Unfortunately, Yakumo just doesn’t have the same skill with these moves that Ryu showcased in prior games, so a well-timed Guillotine Throw won’t murder an enemy outright but instead simply throw them outside of the range of Yakumo’s assortment of weapons with only a small amount of damage.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In some ways, the combat is simplified from the series’ last entry, Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge. Throws outside of the Guillotine Throw aren’t really part of Yakumo’s skillset and oh-so-many of his fights are dependent on flashy obliteration and instant kills. Most enemies have to be dispatched by pressing the triangle button after they’ve lost a limb, leading to a quick cut-in of Yakumo taking their head off each and every time. It pulls away from the action for a brief moment when the player should instead be focused on trying to dodge an incoming attack that I found these repeated obliteration moves to be somewhat of a distraction from what was otherwise some of PlatinumGames’ best combat to date, although it can also be some of their most challenging and frustrating if you don’t engage with all of the defensive options at Yakumo’s disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the level design in Ninja Gaiden 4 is fantastic and Yakumo winds up murdering demons across a wide variety of biomes, from the rainy streets of neo futuristic Tokyo at night to snowy temple grounds to laser-filled dance halls, the sense of exploration is limited at best. Far too often, Yakumo runs through a guided path from combat encounter to combat encounter before reaching the boss, but for the few instances where the player can go off the rails and explore down a side path often rewards the player with some sort of side mission or collectible to boost his health. That isn’t to say that the on-rails segments are a poor part of the Ninja Gaiden 4 experience; in fact, it’s far from it. Yakumo can wall run, glide, and even surf like a proper ninja in full PlatinumGames spectacle, but the areas that stop holding the players hand and let them check out an area at their own pace feel few and far between.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another knock against Ninja Gaiden 4’s level progression is just how many times Yakumo finds himself falling off a ledge or just generally getting distracted from his goal. Early on, one of Yakumo’s chapters ends with him falling through a rotten bridge when he was only mere steps away from his goal of unsealing one of the Dark Dragon’s temples, thus leading into an entire chapter of side diversions just to get back up the mountain to where he once was. PlatinumGames then has the audacity to pull the trick a second time at the end of that chapter, leading into a padded opening act that could have simply been avoided if Yakumo remembered that he’s a ninja that can defy gravity and simply jump. In fact, this trope of getting diverted at the last minute from accomplishing his goal is a common trope in the first half of Ninja Gaiden 4 that one has to wonder if these chapters weren’t simply thrown in to pad the already-extensive runtime and make this sequel feel meatier than it actually was. At least the combat continued to shine through arena after arena of mindless demon spawn all intent on taking Yakumo’s head.&nbsp; When it's all said and done, my playthrough of Ninja Gaiden 4 took just shy of twenty hours to clear just as many chapters. On average, a number of the early chapters lasted around forty minutes each, although that time does include tackling some of the optional challenge arenas with a health handicap to earn a few extra ninja bucks and points to pick up some extra skills for the future. Throw in a mandatory second playthrough on Master Ninja if you're aiming for the platinum trophy and I wouldn't be surprised if most players need a good forty hours to earn every achievement and secure the title of True Ninja.</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 represents a bold take on the legacy of Ryu Hayabusa and the Dark Dragon with all of the charm and signatures of PlatinumGames throughout. At times, it can be frustrating and even an exercise in patience to become a master ninja and learn to survive an arena unscathed while still retaining the fundamentals of what made the original Xbox trilogy so well renowned. I don’t know what it is about character action games and long-awaited sequels but there’s always something so damn special to them that they’re an instant recommendation, difficulty aside.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>What do you want out of a modern, big-budget, blockbuster video game? Large, detailed environments to explore? Tons of skill trees, crafting systems, and resources to manage? An HBO-worthy story with top-notch voice acting that keeps you playing until the end? <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> does not give a fuck about any of these things.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-hitstop-difficulty-game-pass-2000623220"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is here</a> to serve you up tense, twitchy combo-based action and flashy but simple backdrops for ever more ridiculous boss fights and bloodbaths. Nothing more. Nothing less. It gets that job done with S-tier style and attention to detail. Everything else is…<em>fine</em>. I hope that doesn’t sound like a disappointment.</p>

 <p>It’s not. I’m 10 hours into Team Ninja and Platinum Games’ cyberpunk-infused joint entry in the long-running series and I’ve been loving every no-frills moment. The sequel is out October 20 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (published by Microsoft and available day-one on Game Pass Ultimate) and my full review won’t be out until later this week. I’ll leave more of my nitpicks until then. For now I can confidentially say this game has some real juice.</p>

 <p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is the Brazilian steakhouse where the hosts keep plopping down increasingly rich and tasty hunks of meat until you feel completely gorged and then they give you more and you keep going because it’s just that good and also the world will fall to ruin at the hands of a mythic evil dragon if you don’t.</p>

 <p>There’s not a lot of variety. You may occasionally break into a sweaty panic. But plate after plate of bloody brawls and bone-crunching boss fights will arrive and you will not send them back because this is Team Ninja’s house and you will feast until it’s over because who knows, it could be another 13 years until the next <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> arrives.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637430"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637430">Team Ninja / Microsoft</figcaption></figure> <p>If you haven’t been keeping up, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> puts you in the shoes of Ryu Hayabusa’s rival Yakumo who wields the Bloodraven Form technique to chain the blood of his enemies into dazzling and devastating combo attacks (you also play as Ryu in some chapters). Yakumo gets access to multiple weapons with different attack patterns and unlockable move sets. There’s even an ultimate meter you can fill up to unleash quick executions.</p>

 <p>Combined with dodges, parries, and an overwhelming number of fighting-game-style aerial maneuvers and attacks, the combat rewards close attention and thoughtful execution. It’s a button-mashing gorefest, except that every button is pressed for a particular reason and if it’s not, you’re probably looking at the game over screen again.</p>

 <p>Every challenge room and boss fight so far has left me feeling satisfied and accomplished in exchange for the effort expended, even when progress slowed to a crawl and it briefly felt like I was banging my head against the wall. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is so limited and focused in terms of what it puts in front of you that I found these periods of stalled momentum as cathartic and calming as pushing through to the next chapter.</p> <p>I won’t talk about the story because I’m not finished yet and, well, when has a<em> Ninja Gaiden</em> story ever really mattered that much? There’s a mysterious woman manipulating you into breaking magical seals to purify the ancient dragon and prevent it from returning to haunt neo-Tokyo. The English language dubs are not great so I’m playing with subtitles. The conversations and characters, like the spartan levels you encounter them in, provide the most barebones table setting for a linear series of battles and the occasional 3D <em>Sonic</em>-style platforming section.</p> <p>None of the stuff outside of combat has been all that great in<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em> so far, so I welcome there being so little of it. This is a game about seeing how long you can keep your health meter unscathed while landing just enough blows to randomly sever an enemy’s limb and open them up to a grisly execution move that sprays blood all over the screen and nets you points toward your high score for the stage. It’s strikingly old-school that way. It’s nice to have you back, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</p>
