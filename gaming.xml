            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering</a> </em>set is here, and there’s never been a more perfect assemblage of <em>Magic</em> cards. The set features cards taken from every mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em> title, including the two MMOs, so there’s something for every generation of <em>Final Fantasy</em> lovers. And while <em>Magic</em> has featured other video game crossovers in the past (hello, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Fallout</em>!), with the way this set is constructed, from card mechanics to art, you can tell this one is a developer favorite, sure to appeal to the massive chunk of people who love both games. </p><p>But what if you don’t inhabit the center circle in the Venn diagram of<em> Magic</em> and <em>Final Fantasy </em>lovers but are still interested in experiencing this set for yourself? <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is an intimidating game, even if you’re a seasoned player like myself. There are so many ways you can play, both in person and online, that it can be overwhelming to figure out the best way to jump in. So here’s a few tips and tricks to playing the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic</em> set. </p><p>Be warned, though: this is the best-selling set in<em> Magic</em>’s 30-plus-year history, and you will pay for the pleasure of this experience — if you can find the product to pay for it at all. </p><p><strong>How to play: physical edition</strong></p><p>Over the years, the designers at <em>Magic</em> developer Wizards of the Coast have realized it can be intimidating as hell for a new player looking to start their planeswalking journey. To help these new players along, <em>Magic</em> developers have created a line of products called Starter Kits. Each is a set of two 60-card decks featuring cards specifically designed for new players and an instruction booklet that goes over the game’s basic rules and cadence of play. Keep one deck for yourself, give one to a friend, and learn as you play together. For <em>MTG x FF</em>, the starter kit features two decks themed around <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s greatest rivalry: <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-starter-kit-decklists">Sephiroth vs. Cloud</a>.</p><p>These decks are a decent introductory course to <em>Magic</em>. Cloud’s is themed around equipment cards (think the Buster Sword or the Ultima Weapon), which are essentially weapons you can attach to your creatures to pump up their damage and hit hard. Sephiroth’s deck is all about him. Kill creatures (yours and your opponent’s) to make him as big as possible. I played both decks against the set’s designers and managed to beat them both, a monumental feat for any <em>Magic</em> player. However, if you want to play them for yourself, the Starter Kit is currently sold out on Amazon, so your best bet to find one is to hit up your local card shop (known in the community as your LCS) to see if it has any in stock. Wizards’ website does feature <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/">a handy store locator</a> if you don’t know where your nearest LCS is. </p><p>There are also <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists">four Commander decks</a> you can buy and play, with each one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">themed around a specific title in the series</a>. Commander is the most popular format of <em>Magic</em>, but the rules are slightly different from standard play, and matches can often include more than one opponent. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks are beginner-friendly but expensive, running anywhere from $80 to $130 when Commander decks in other sets are much cheaper.</p><p><strong>How to play: online edition</strong></p><p>If you don’t have any friends you can beg, bribe, or beat into playing <em>Magic</em> with you, there is another, far easier option: the game’s online version, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em>. <em>Arena</em> is the best way to experience the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set as there’s no worry about stock, it’s relatively cheaper, and there are so many different ways to play that in-person playing simply does not accommodate. Once you’ve made your account and downloaded the game, you can play through the game’s tutorial, which I recommend to get your bearings. Not only does it explain how to play, but the color challenges also give you a feel for the playstyles of <em>Magic</em>’s five different colors.</p><div><div><p id="choosing-your-slice-of-the-color-pie"><h2>Choosing your slice of the color pie</h2></p></div><p>Think of colors and color combos as characters in your favorite hero shooter. Each has different abilities and favors a specific style of play. Blue and white center on going over your opponents’ heads with flying creatures, while mono green (my favorite and the best way to play) favors big, stompy creatures that run over your opponents’ defenses. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> set makes it easy to find a color or combo that works for you.</p></div><p>If you want to get straight into the <em>Final Fantas</em>y set, you can simply skip the tutorial to unlock all of <em>Arena</em>’s many game modes and features, and it’ll still be there to try if you ever need to go back. </p><p>Once you’re ready, you have a number of options available. You can get right into the thick of things and start playing the game’s constructed modes. If you’ve never played <em>Magic</em> before, do not do this. It is expensive, costing a lot of resources your account will not have unless you buy them in the game’s cash shop, and it is hard. Making decks is difficult; even I don’t like it that much compared to playing decks preassembled for me.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Some of my favorite cards from this set. </em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Your best, most economical option is to play Jumpstart mode. In Jumpstart all the hard work of making a viable deck is done for you. You are presented with a number of archetypes: Bold, Mage, Chocobos, Equipment, and more. You can pick two of them based on nothing more than vibes and personal preference, and the game will automatically create a deck using those two archetypes. Then you play your deck against other Jumpstart decks and rack up the wins or the valuable experience that comes with losing.</p><p>The great thing about Jumpstart is that it’s cheap — a new account grants you enough currency to try the mode three times — and the cards you pick are yours to keep. Do it enough times and you’ll eventually have enough cards to tool around with making your own decks to try out in the game’s friendly mode, Quick Start. I’ve enjoyed all the different Jumpstart decks I’ve made, but if you really wanna have some fun, pick chocobos whenever you get the chance. They’re creatures that get stronger whenever you play a land card (think of land like the gas that powers your deck’s engine) and have incredible synergy with other card types, leading to a deck that <em>will</em> overwhelm your opponent.</p><p>Also, they’re chocobos! What could be more <em>Final Fantasy</em> than chocobos?</p><p>If you are a <em>Final Fantasy </em>fan, I cannot stress enough how much fun its <em>Magic </em>set is. And if you’re intimidated by <em>Magic</em>’s difficulty, don’t be. There are so many beginner-friendly ways to play, and there are so many beginners trying this set out for the first time, that you’ll be in good company. Plus, I’ve found the community is always happy to help newcomers. When I played at an in-person event, my first opponent had never picked up the game before. Over the course of our match I taught him everything I knew as best I could, and before the end, he beat me. Badly. I’ve never had more fun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hypnospace Outlaw developer Jay Tholen has confirmed the highly anticipated sequel, Dreamsettler, has been cancelled following a "mutual" decision between Tholen and publisher No More Robots.</p>
<p>"This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of a YouTube video entitled: "Dreamsettler is canceled".</p>
<p>"I didn't want to make a video like this, but I'll cut to the chase - Dreamsettler has been cancelled," he said in the ten-minute video. "It means it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."</p>

<figcaption>Dreamsettler is canceled.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH3UbgEWBxg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before going into details, however, Tholen thanks everyone who had signed up to his recently launched Patreon, saying going to the crowdfunding platform was "kind of a last-ditch effort." Refunds will be available for the most recent month's payment.</p>
<p>Tholen also said that while he wasn't currently sure "what form it'll take", he does intend to release more of what would have been in the game, which could possibly include a playable build. He also issued a passionate plea for studios to get in touch and offer work to the two developers who have been let go due to the cancellation.</p>
<p>"The very short version is: we got a budget this time, we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time. Because of that money [...] you have to go by this schedule, and I've never successfully made a game based on a design document."</p>
<p>He then talked about some of his favourite features of Dreamsettler, such as Oomph, a fake music sequencer, but the team "way over-scoped, things were so complicated and so fancy".</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry to everyone who's waiting for this game and expecting a big, great game," Tholen added. "This is, like, almost five years of my life. I mean, I did make [spin-off game] Slayer X, so that was a fun diversion, but this was the big one. I had so many hopes."</p>
<p>For those wondering, yes, The Chowder Man was going to return. "He recorded more music for this game than Hypnospace," Thorlen said, "and I want to do right by the musicians too, so maybe we'll figure out how to release their music and promote it.</p>
<p>"We just needed to stop this. Because of money and practical concerns, I just had to stop it. Hopefully, we can release some of it, or maybe I can write blogs - or some of the team can - and show you what we were doing because there's a lot of cool stuff there. A lot of worthwhile stuff."</p>
<p>Thorlen said he still plans to work on Slayer's next update, with hopes to get it out early next year.</p>
<p>"Maybe I've been burnt out this whole time. I don't know. I was able to do Slayer X, though I would like to do kids' stuff. Stuff for children. I don't know if it would be a video series, or an app for kids, or something. And it's not because I think this is a great market to get into, but it's because there are things I've searched for and they don't exist, and I want to make them, just for my own kids.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, everyone. This just stinks. Again, I want to emphasise the publisher did a great job, Mike and Mark did an excellent job. I think I'm a hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."</p>
<p>We discovered Hypnospace Outlaw would be getting a sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettlers">back in 2022</a>. Another game, Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer - a spin-off made by the fictitious Hypnospace Outlaw character, Zane - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-spin-off-slayers-x-gets-june-release-date">released in June 2023</a>.</p>
<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-review-resurrecting-a-forgotten-internet-warts-and-all">Hypnospace Outlaw a hearty Recommended</a> when it released in 2019, writing: "A witty and smitten recreation of a time gone by, which you'll forgive tedium if you share in the nostalgia."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettler-cancelled-as-creator-issues-heartfelt-statement-maybe-ive-been-burnt-out-this-whole-time]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement.1224777/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A limited Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition has been leaked in pictures<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1936165435164045812#m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> via X user Zuby_Tech</a> and might be very close to launch, at least <a href="https://www.gamesandwich.com/news/source-meta-will-announce-an-xbox-quest-3s-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Game Sandwich</a>, which reckons the branded VR device will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, June 24.</p>
<p>The report says the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will include a black and green headset with matching accessories, an Elite Strap, an Xbox wireless controller and a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Internally, it will have the same 128 GB standard system memory as the Meta Quest 3S. Pricing will be set at $399.</p>
<p>Meta officially&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-opens-up-quest-os-to-third-party-hardware-makers-asus-to-make-high-performance-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> its operating system to third-party hardware makers in April 2024. Back then, ASUS announced that it would craft a high-performance ROG VR headset, although we haven't received any further details. Alongside that announcement, Meta revealed it would release a limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been taking steps to bring Meta Quest users to the Xbox platform for a while. In late 2023, Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3-launches-on-october-10-with-asgards-wrath-2-bundled-xbox-cloud-gaming-coming-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became available on the VR headset</a>, allowing Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream games to their Meta Quest and experience them as if viewing a massive 2D screen. Games are streamed at 1080p (FullHD) resolution and 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>It's all part of Microsoft's grand plan to bring Xbox to virtually every device that has a screen and could run a game, including TVs, smartphones, and VR devices. Granted, it's unlikely that the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition could move the needle in any major way, but it is yet another in a series of initiatives that go in the same direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I wouldn’t have preordered a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> just for myself. The price is high, there’s no new <em>Smash Bros. </em>or <em>Metroid Prime</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond">yet</a>), and I’ve got a perfectly good original Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck that keep me plenty busy. At first, I could only justify the $450 because I write about gaming tech for <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>But two weeks in, I can <em>almost </em>justify the cost one additional way: the Switch 2 is turning out to be an upgrade for my whole family. </p><p>I’m not primarily talking about hand-me-downs, though yes, you could absolutely hand your original Switch down to a kid while basking in the glory of the Switch 2’s larger, faster screen. Mom and dad always get the best seats in the house, right? </p><p>But no: I’m talking about how Nintendo’s new features are helping me share the delight of gaming with my 8-year-old kid like never before.</p><p>We bought my daughter a Switch Lite last Christmas, with <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Let’s Go Pikachu</em>, and that’s pretty much all she played. All other gaming monopolized the living room TV, where she and her younger sister often clash over what to watch next. </p><p>But two weeks ago, my eldest suddenly realized that we could now magically beam any of my old purchased digital games from my Switch 2 to her Switch Lite, lending them out like a library for two weeks at a time. While I played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> for the Switch 2, she practiced her skills in my old copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>; soon, I’ll play the gruesome <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> while she tries <em>Stardew Valley</em>. And in both cases, I don’t need to worry whether she’ll lose a cartridge. </p><p>Then we found GameShare, a feature that lets a Switch 2 beam its entire screen and controls to a second Switch, giving a second person their own screen and control for a selection of multiplayer games. We began playing <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> as daughter and dad, alternating between who controlled Mario and who controlled his sentient flying hat, Cappy. </p><p>Since each of us effectively had our own portable TV, she didn’t shove her head between me and the screen like she sometimes does when we’re reading bedtime books. And since neither of us was monopolizing the TV, the younger kid got to keep on watching her YouTube videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C__Vzcq2lDc">intricately animated stop-motion Lego food factories</a>. </p><p>When it was time for me to fly across the country last week, my eldest begged me to let her keep playing <em>Mario</em> <em>Odyssey</em> while I was gone. Virtual game cards came through once again: five quick taps, and a game download magically appeared on her Switch. </p><p>She <em>did</em> have to start the game from scratch, since I couldn’t find a way to sync a save game between two different consoles with two different Nintendo accounts… but it turns out that was her plan all along. Apparently 8-year-olds enjoy repetition much more than us adults!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m still a fan of physical media, and I especially worry that Nintendo will pull the rug out from under our digital purchases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657431/wii-u-nintendo-3ds-eshops-shut-down">given its track record</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306470/the-switch-eshop-has-a-closure-date-in-china">closing eShops</a>. I think Nintendo could do a lot more to make the Switch and Switch 2 better for parents, too. </p><p>For one, I wish the company hadn’t arbitrarily locked its webcam-enabled GameChat to the new Nintendo Switch 2, as I would have loved to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my daughter during my business trip. The original Switch and Switch Lite might not have the horsepower for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">simultaneous four-player screen sharing and video chat like the Switch 2</a>, but surely they have enough for the webcams alone? It’s also awkward that there’s still no obvious way to merge the save games from the offline “kid” profile on my original Switch to my daughter’s Nintendo account.</p><p>But most of all, I fear the two-screens-for-one-game GameShare may not get the attention or adoption it deserves. It’s such a clever way of repurposing cloud gaming technology, but the initial list of GameShare-compatible games is vanishingly short and doesn’t yet include obvious wins like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, the newest mainline entry in the series and one that’s great to play with kids. </p><p>It’s been nearly 25 years since <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em> for the Game Boy Advance let you hook up four portable consoles to play limited multiplayer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxJfaR5guE&amp;list=PL9exeo9gYxCaRwVKrU5yS6Zqrf9c15I_R&amp;index=5">even if only a single person had a copy of the game</a>. <em>Mario Kart DS</em> did the same thing 20 years ago over Wi-Fi, again offering single cartridge multiplayer, with “DS Download Play.” But it required conscious effort from game developers to create new single cart mulitplayer modes for their GBA and DS titles, and not every deserving game had one. GameShare shouldn’t have that problem: since it’s just streaming a screen and controller inputs, it should theoretically work on <em>any</em> game you’d play on a single screen today. And yet for some reason, Nintendo hasn’t turned it on for many games at once.</p><p>If Nintendo can make GameShare standard for the Switch’s many fabulous third-party couch games, like <em>Overcooked 2</em>, <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, and <em>Lego Star Wars</em>, while enabling its own titles, like <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, it could make the Switch 2 an easier choice for parents who want to play together with their kids. </p><p>And that would play right into Nintendo’s end goal for the past seven years. As Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto laid out <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2018/180210e.pdf">in 2018</a>: “Our ultimate ambition is for a Nintendo Switch to be owned not just by every family, but by every single person.” Personally, I now have a Switch 2, a Switch, and a Switch Lite in our house. We are almost Nintendo’s dream family.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/690224/nintendo-switch-2-parenting-gameshare]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-do-you-have-a-new-go-to-racer-in-mario-kart-world</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/talking-point-do-you-have-a-new-go-to-racer-in-mario-kart-world.1224753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Main Racer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/65ffcde0730e0/mario-kart-world-main-racer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After the best part of a decade with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a>, we'd wager that you had probably grown pretty close to your main. You know, your <em>main</em>. The character that you picked to sit behind the wheel, regardless of the situation, because their weight class, look, or general vibe matched your playstyle perfectly.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came along and shook those mains up. A new batch of racers have been added to the mix, but a huge batch have also fallen off the roster (pour one out for the Koopaling mains out there). After two weeks of open-world racing, huge swathes of us have found ourselves pivoting to a <em>new</em> racer, either drawn in by the shiny new faces, or rebounding from the loss of our go-to picks.</p>
<p>The question is, have you pivoted from your old main and if so, who's your new go-to racer? A handful of us Nintendo Lifers have shared our picks below, but you can take to the comments to let us know yours too.</p>

<h2>Mole in One (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Monty Mole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41701a1150375/mario-kart-world-monty-mole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My Mario Kart 8 sweetheart, Roy, was one of the many faces lost to the abyss, so I came into World knowing that I'd have to find somebody new. I was tempted by Cow, but she quickly got too mainstream. Goomba appealed to my usual Lil' Guy preference, but lost my attention. Birdo made a good play for top dog and is still first on my reserves bench. But none of them stuck as much as Monty Mole.</p>
<p>I'm yet to work out whether there's anything that keeps pulling me back to this little fella outside of the fact that he bashes his belly when he's pleased with himself (he just like me, fr), but regardless, he has been my go-to racer through thick and thin so far. The lack of outfits is upsetting — come on, Nintendo, give all the bad guys a couple of looks! — but stick this underground underdog in a Biddybuggy or Pipe Frame and <em>boom</em>, instant dopamine hit.</p>
<p>The lore may state that nobody likes him, but Monty Mole is quickly becoming my best pal.</p>

<h2>Drivin' on Sunshine, whoa-oh (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="MK World 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9113762b2b1b2/mk-world-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everybody should know by now that I have a major soft spot for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, so of course my go-to is going to be Sightseeing Mario. It's basically the closest I'm going to get to a direct visual reference to Sunshine in 2025 (other than Pianta, I know, shut up), so I'll take it.</p>
<p>Combined with the Funky Dorrie vehicle – which basically looks like a dolphin-themed jetski – I can cruise about the world in <em>ultimate</em> style. And look, I couldn't give a hoot if it's not very good in terms of stats; It looks awesome, and that's all that matters!</p>
<p>Bonus points if the combination also lines up with the Isle Delfino track from MK World's exceptional soundtrack. Pure bliss.</p>
<h2>Pipe frame's my main frame (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Waluigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df5c6f368eb3a/mario-kart-world-waluigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new racer? Nope. Waluigi on a pipe-frame kart. Always. Job done.</p>
<p>I know people like to analyse driver weights and kart velocity and coin-speed percentages and all that game, but I can't be doing with any of that crap. For Time Trails, perhaps, but that's not what the main game's about.</p>
<p>Seriously, in a series with rubber-band items that you can win <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/04/weirdness_you_can_play_and_win_in_mario_kart_8_deluxe_without_touching_the_controller">by doing absolutely nothing</a>, I'm not farting around with anything beyond, 'Yep, the lanky <strong>Lazy Town</strong>-lookin' dude in a sombrero, please.'</p>
<p>And I always choose the pipe-frame because it reminds me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">MK64</a>, my first Mario Kart. For the same reason, I'll <em>sometimes</em> I'll choose DK in lieu of Waluigi, as he was my go-to back in the '90s. He dabs a lot these days, though, and I lose a tiny piece of respect for him each time he does.</p>
<h2>Pretty fly for a shy guy (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Conkdor" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f72367b6f22dd/mario-kart-world-conkdor.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am a steadfast Shy Guy sort of person, it's a character that speaks to me on many levels, and he's been my go-to for a long time now.</p>
<p>However! I was tootling around in Mario Kart World the other night when I happened to unlock Conkdor, and let me tell you something...the moment I saw those killer purple shades, that tiny spiky shell, and a poker face that could put Robert Shaw out of business, I knew it was time to take my racing style to the skies. I'm actually considering a tattoo. I have become one with the Conkdor.</p>
<p>Perch said bird on my current cart of choice, the incredibly bad-ass Baby Blooper, and I believe you'll find I'm quite unbeatable. Until I'm not.</p>
<h2>Racing for Boo-ty (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World King Boo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc5d1e159c276/mario-kart-world-king-boo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seems like I can't shake old habits. As much as the many new NPC characters make me laugh (Cow, Penguin... Sidestepper???), I have once again gravitated to my favourite spooky sovereign, King Boo.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> boos. They're super adorable, and some of my favourite stages in classic Mario games are the Boo Houses. Giving a big boo a <em>crown</em> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> was just an easy win. He's been one of my mains since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Double Dash</a>, but in World, he's usually donning the Pirate outfit. A crown <em>and</em> some jewels? He's heavy (but not too heavy), and on the R.O.B. H.O.G., he's an unstoppable</p>
<p>Another Double Dash main I keep returning to is Toadette, but mostly because she's cute. The Soft Server outfit? Come on. Look at those sparkles and those glasses. But King Boo will always be number one.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>There are our picks, but what about you? You can let us know your Mario Kart World main in the following poll — and no, we haven't listed all the outfits too, so if your main has a particular look, you'll have to select the character and then let us know their wardrobe of choice in the comments below!</em></p>

<figure><a title="Former Nintendo Marketing Leads Fear We Might Be Waiting A While For A 3D Mario On Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a31a8afd8f7d/former-nintendo-marketing-leads-fear-we-might-be-waiting-a-while-for-a-3d-mario-on-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that the reaction to the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-so-will-you-be-getting-donkey-kong-bananza-for-switch-2">overwhelmingly positive</a>, and the perception of the already-anticipated Switch 2 title has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>In fact, DK's next 3D adventure looks <em>so</em> good that some people speculate it might be the work of Nintendo's biggest and most talented development team: Entertainment Planning &amp; Development (EPD).</p>
<p>EPD, as we're sure you're aware, created the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and is expected to be the force behind Mario's first 3D outing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't stated which team is working on Donkey Kong Bananza, but Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang—two former senior Nintendo staffers—have speculated that it <em>might</em> be EPD, which ties in with rumours we reported on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/rumour_the_next_donkey_kong_is_being_developed_by_the_super_mario_odyssey_team">all the way back in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Ellis believes that EPD could be developing the game, and if that is the case, "we might just be waiting for a good long time before we get the next 3D Mario game. That team is incredible; nobody's disputing the quality, [but] they are not fast, they are not prolific, they are not pumping out games."</p>
<p>In response to this comment, Yang says that we could be waiting between four and five years for Mario's big 3D debut on Switch 2, which would make it a mid-to-late generation release for the console. Yang also speculates that Nintendo isn't making any announcement on the development team for fear of upsetting those who are eagerly anticipating a 3D Mario in the next year or so.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a history of working with external studios on some of its biggest titles, with Bandai Namco being a regular contributor. It also has had several studios within its extended family which have worked on the Donkey Kong franchise in the past; UK-based <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/sacred-spaces-rares-manor-farm-hq-nintendos-90s-hit-factory">Rare</a> (now owned by Microsoft) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">famously rebooted the character back in 1994</a>, and, more recently, Retro Studios gave Kong a new lease of life on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Wii</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a>.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th.</p>

            <p>Splitgate 2 developer 1047 Games has laid off a "small group of valued staff".</p>

It did not clarify just how many developers were impacted, but co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian will reportedly not be drawing salaries as the team "locks in to deliver the next phase of the project".</p>

<p>"Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members. We're still perfecting the Splitgate 2 gameplay experience in response to community feedback, and we are redirecting resources to build the best game for our players," the statement said (thanks, <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/06/21/1047-games-developers-of-splitgate-2-layoff-a-small-group-of-valued-staff/">XboxEra</a>).</p>
<p>"We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities. Further, our co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project. Thank you to those who've built alongside us — we are sad to say goodbye and would not be here without you.</p>
<p>"To everyone who's playing Splitgate 2, we're continuing to work hard to deliver more things we know you'll love. We are committed to building this game for the long haul."</p>
<p>It's been a tumultuous time for 1047. Last week, Proulx apologised for causing "division in the community" following his controversial Summer Game Fest appearance, in which he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat while onstage</a> just days after the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">apologised for a $145 cosmetic</a>, slashing the cost to $40 and refunding the difference for those that had already purchased it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Has Already Overtaken The Combined Lifetime Sales Of The Entire Xbox Series Family And PS5 Pro In Japan 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d31c6e168bc25/switch-2-has-already-overtaken-the-combined-lifetime-sales-of-the-entire-xbox-series-family-and-ps5-pro-in-japan-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> is off to an amazing start all over the world, but in Japan, its success has been especially remarkable; it's already the fastest-selling console in the nation's history, outperforming even the mighty PS2.</p>
<p>With 947,931 consoles sold at launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">the Switch 2 overtook the 630,552 set by Sony's second PlayStation</a>. We now have the console's second-week figures in, which make for some interesting reading. The hybrid system's first-week momentum has slowed, as you might expect, but it has now sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-wont-slow-down-surpasses-1-million-consoles-sold">1,101,136 systems in its homeland.</a></p>
<p>This robust performance means that Switch 2 has already outsold the combined lifetime sales of the <em>entire</em> Xbox Series family in Japan—that includes the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2020/11/hardware_review_xbox_series_x_-_the_fastest_most_powerful_xbox_ever">Series X</a> (320,762), <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-whats-the-difference">Series S</a> (337,811) and Series X Digital Edition (20,854)—as well as the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5-pro-an-impressive-yet-inconsistent-upgrade">PS5 Pro</a> (221,181).</p>
<p>Here's the full table, which covers Switch 2's second week on sale:</p>

<p>Given the notoriously weak performance of Xbox hardware in Japan, this won't come as a shock to some people, but it's still pretty incredible that Nintendo has been able to leapfrog Microsoft's family of systems in Japan in such a short space of time.</p>
<p>It might have some way to go to overtake the PS5's lifetime sales in Japan, of course, but with that figure standing at 5,690,661—and taking into account the Switch 2's explosive debut—we wouldn't bet on it taking very long.</p>

		<p>It’s the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, and it’s set to be one of the hottest in the UK as well. So I hope you’ve all got plans for both staying out late and for staying cool while doing so. Don’t forget your sunscreen! Unless, of course, you’re intent on bathing in the cool blue glow of computer and TV screens this weekend. Maybe you’re putting the 24Hr Nürburgring on the telly and just letting the weekend wash over you?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> has approached the end of Act1 in Tainted Grail, which has been a 9/10 experience for him so far, as he’s luckily been unaffected by a strange VFX issue that the devs are working to try to resolve. May it remain that way!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, but I hope you have a great time, whether you’re watching fast cars, hiding from the sun, basking in it or whatever you have planned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dreamsettler, the sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/04/25/patrolling-the-90s-internet-in-hypnospace-outlaw/">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>, has been cancelled, a deeply apologetic and saddened Jay Tholen has confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dreamsettler is canceled" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uH3UbgEWBxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the 10 minute video blog, Tholen goes into some of the creative struggles that he faced in trying create a sequel to the 2019 indie hit. He heaps praise upon his developers, Mike Lasch and Mark LaCroix, and says that publisher No More Robots were great to work with, and instead shoulders the blame for the cancellation himself, citing difficulties with working in a more structured and precisely budgeted manner.</p>
<p>In the end, it seems that the project basically ran out of money to let Tholen’s emerging, improvisational vision for the sequel come together. They even launched a Patreon a few months ago to try and gain additional funding and support, but this wasn’t enough to support the development. Tholen has said that, if supporters wish, they may request a refund for their last payment, which will come out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>Tholen intends to try to release some of the work that had already gone into Dreamsettler, though is not clear on what form this will take and when it can happen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dreamsettler Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFvoO7ZaUKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following on from the late 90s OS and internet simulator detective story of Hypnospace Outlaw, Dreamsettler was going to jump ahead to the early 2000s, incorporating a more animated rendition of operating systems and websites from that time, even going so far as to having a fictionalised version of Flash in the game. A key hook was that, with you turning to be an independent private investigator, you would be building your own website within the game, as well as taking on and solving cases.</p>
<p>It’s obviously a real shame that this project couldn’t come together, as Hypnospace is certainly one of the more distinctive and special titles from the past decade.</p>

<figure><a title="Yakuza 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ea2b376ca9e9b/yakuza-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, can you believe it's already been over two weeks since the Switch 2 launched? Where does the time go?</p>
<p>Alas, it's true, but this week brought even more news with the big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a>! It revealed a boatload of new information and made many of us here at NL <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">infinitely more excited for its release next month</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 also got its first big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">stability patch</a>, which is nice, and it's also been reported that third-party launch games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">didn't sell quite as well as publishers would have hoped</a>, despite the Switch 2 getting off to a roaring start.</p>

<p>Now, it's time to kick back and relax with some games, so let's see what we're up to this weekend...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:183939 @ 1750520896 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I finally picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> last weekend and have been enjoying noodling around the past couple of evenings. I’m only an hour or two in at this point and it’s yet to really get its hooks in me, but I’m sure a good sesh this weekend will help that along a bit.</p>
<p>I’m also really fighting the urge to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> after that Donkey Kong Direct. Maybe I’ll just hop in to mop up a few more moons… maybe…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>If you'd have told me that my most-played games on the brand-spanking new Switch 2 would be GameCube titles, well... yeah, I would've believed you. I love that I can just whip out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a> while my daughter watches utter rubbish on TV.</p>
<p>I am, however, putting quite a few hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>. I must admit, I've been struggling to really settle on something now that most my launch review responsibilities have been fulfilled, but Yakuza really hooks you from the start, and I'm really enjoying my time with it. It looks great and runs like a dream.</p>
<h2>Zion Grassl, Video Producer</h2>
<p>While at times lately it feels like my brain is slowly mutating into a Switch 2, I’ve not had as much time as I’d like with some of the games I’ve been most looking forward to on it. I’ve played so much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> though, lemme tell ya.</p>
<p>Life gets complicated sometimes, but this weekend sounds like it’s gonna be easy! So that means I’m diving headfirst into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>. The music, the characters, the combat! Ugh! I’ve already played Chapter 1 and 2, but with 3 and 4 now available, I’m planning to refresh myself with a new playthrough because my brain is mush and I don’t remember as much as I’d like…and I also want to relive those silly moments with Lancer and Spamton!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'll be chipping away at Cyberpunk and otherwise scanning my library and making space for some more kid-friendly fare ahead of a family trip (in addition to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">51 Clubhouse Games</a>' ever-reliable Ludo board, natch).</p>
<p>Despite not being truly grabbed by Free Roam in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, I'm still dipping in now and then to explore, so it must be doing <em>something</em> right. A little more of that too, then. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tron_catalyst">TRON: Catalyst</a> is proving to be quite a good surprise on Switch but most of the weekend will be spend in the streets of Kamurochō. I would probably be far more advanced plotwise in Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut if I did not stop to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/out_run">OutRun</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> every time I pass by the arcades, not even mentioning the bowling alley, the Shogi club, the Mahjong club, the batting center… yeah, now I remember why I kept postponing getting into SEGA’s flagship series: These games are made to keep you constantly distracted while having a fine time while at it. Also, what is up with this clean cut, civilised Goro Majima!?</p>
<p>Meanwhile on PC, having terminated (ah) my first time campaign playthrough of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/terminator_resistance">Terminator: Resistance</a> (a brilliant game I missed upon release) I am quite keen to at last start up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>. You know the drill: my generation was brought up on these movies and we are now living in a distant future where video game technology allows us to "live out" these franchises via our joypad. Sadly, we do have to buy them for way more than a dollar.</p>
<h2>Ken Talbot, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still spending time in Night City and marvelling at the performance on my undocked Switch 2.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I’ll be revelling in the utter chaos of online Mario Kart World, including the great new knockout mode, which is both infuriating and humbling.</p>

<p>Instead of getting Switch 2, I’ve gone back a few consoles and am playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">Pokémon SoulSilver</a> on DS. It’s so much fun seeing the series in its heyday (it’s literally the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1750503536509000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AEl_TN9xdMpQgSA-5fkRV" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pokemon-games-of-all-time">number one rated game here on NL</a>). The little puzzles, the fun characters, the many many mechanics… They don’t make ’em like this any more.</p>
<p>Other than that I’m cosying up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> – a slightly more recent classic.</p>

<p>Being unable to get in on the Switch 2 right now I’m doubling down on my Switch 1, and going firmly old-school with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a>.</p>
<p>I’m working on a long-time-coming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_castlevania_iv">Super Castlevania IV</a> one credit clear, and I was so close on my last attempt I’m already haunted!</p>

<p>It’s another heaping plate of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut for me this weekend. After years of wanting to jump into the franchise but feeling a tad overwhelmed by the scope of it all, I figured that this enhanced port launching next to Switch 2 was as good of an opportunity as I was going to get.</p>
<p>I’m having a blast working my way through the story but, man, I can feel the other games I need to play piling up as I sink hour after hour into this one. Some days I don’t even make progress — I just play darts for an hour, eat a burger, and then go on some insane side quest to beat up a cult leader. In the words of one Frank Reynolds, <em>“Oh my god…I get it.”</em></p>

<p>I'm writing in from Singapore, where, sadly, the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to go on sale. I'm woefully behind the curve but hopefully, by this time next week, the next-gen Ninty console should already be in my hands.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I've been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fantasian_neo_dimension">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, the latest from <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The game's diorama-style landscapes look incredible on the Switch OLED, and the battle system offers a unique twist on turn-based combat. I have a deep reservoir of nostalgia for PlayStation-era Final Fantasy, and this scratches the itch for what it's worth. So I'll be chipping away at that until my Switch 2 arrives, and then it'll finally be time for Mario Kart World. Better late than never.</p>

<p>I'm still wrapping my head around playing Cyberpunk 2077 in the palm of my hands so I'll be making my way through Night City this weekend while cozied up in bed.</p>
<p>I'll also be playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. And if I have time, I'll finally be starting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's first online cooperative multiplayer game, has just launched on PC and consoles. So far, users don't appear very happy with it - the game didn't even break 2K concurrent users <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=4777282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, and reviews are 'Mixed', with only 65% of users giving a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Remedy plans to improve the game in many ways, though. Update 1.2 just went live, focusing on making progression faster and more rewarding. Changes made to the economy improve how players earn and spend in-game currencies. The Requisition store now separates gear from cosmetics, and job progression has been restructured to enable players to access full Jobs (all three zones) more quickly.</p>
<p>That's just the beginning. The Finnish studio also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920274" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a more detailed letter acknowledging the game's shortcomings and providing an inkling of its following areas of focus for improvement.</p>
<p>Remedy admitted that the initial hours do not provide a great experience, partly due to a lack of proper onboarding and partly to a lack of clarity regarding what to do in the Jobs and how to do the work effectively. Additionally, the sense of power isn’t great in the game's early stages, as starting (tier 1) weapons feel weak and unlocking higher-tier weapons requires excessive grinding.</p>
<p>However, the team reckons that players who stick around with FBC: Firebreak, unlock more powerful tier 3 weapons and perks, and play at higher threat levels and full three-zone job runs, are enjoying themselves more.</p>
<p>The game currently throws players in the middle of the action with little guidance on the game's systems, the player's actions in Jobs, and status effects. So, Remedy is looking at&nbsp;communicating the synergies between Crisis Kits more clearly and providing players with much better information on how to complete Jobs effectively.</p>
<p>This includes improving the readability of harmful conditions, such as being on fire, and the flashing blue effect, which indicates whether you have entered or exited the range of your crewmates to have Resonance and a shared shield. Objective markers are also unclear and do not provide sufficient guidance on what to do. Remedy is evaluating all this and has already gathered some ideas for improvement, but will need some time to plan and implement the changes properly.</p>

<p>Fans are already calling for a Switch 2 port</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Lies of P" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24c2c3299b595/lies-of-p.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It's been a difficult year for the video game industry at times, but there are still plenty of success stories out there and the latest one is a sales milestone for the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studio.</p>
<p>While we don't have anything to report here about a Switch 2 release (<em>at least for now</em>), according to South Korean publication <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec (via VGC)</a>, Korean publisher Neowiz is rewarding every member of the local development team with Nintendo's brand-new system after the success of the new DLC 'Overture' and more than three million cumulative sales.</p>
<p>It doesn't end there, with the team also getting launch bonuses (of roughly $7,300) and two weeks paid vacation on top of the country's "mandatory 15 days of paid vacation". And hey, there's all that time to enjoy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other games!</p>
<p>Sure enough, this news has resulted in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1lg3ono/lies_of_p_devs_get_bonus_paid_holiday_and_switch/">Switch 2 and Nintendo fans calling for a port</a>. The action RPG with "soulslike" elements launched on platforms like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as well as the next-generation systems in 2023, so maybe there's a chance. For now, soulslike fans with a Switch 2 can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> as well as FromSoftware's new multiplayer game.</p>
<p>When this game was originally released on the PS5, our pals at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lies_of_p"><strong>Push Square</strong></a> awarded it eight out ten stars – calling it a "first-class" souls-like experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lies of P feels like the result of a developer having already taken multiple stabs at the Souls-like genre, so it's impressive that Round8 Studio has accomplished so much on its first attempt. By fully embracing its dark take on the Pinocchio story, it sets itself apart from anything else available. Elevating it above other games are quality combat and extensive, satisfying customisation, turning Lies of P into a first-class experience for FromSoftware fanatics."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, this isn't the only team to be gifted Switch 2 recently, with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/stellar-blade-dev-says-nothing-confirmed-regarding-switch-2-port-rumours">Stellar Blade studio Shift Up</a> also handing out the new Nintendo system to its employees.</p>

<p>"Put the pedal to the metal"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you're a racing fan and are looking for something else to play on the Switch 2, you'll pleased to hear <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now compatible on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p>Developer Feral Interactive has provided an update on the state of the game – confirming it's now ready to race on the new hardware. There was apparently an "issue that was blocking startup" that's now been resolved in the latest Switch 2 firmware update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feral Interactive:</strong> "Switch 2 racers rejoice! The high-octane thrills of GRID Autosport are now playable on your shiny new console! An issue that was blocking startup has been fixed by the new Switch 2 firmware update, so grab yourself the latest version and put the pedal to the metal!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="PH9AJiL5EQ8" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PH9AJiL5EQ8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9AJiL5EQ8">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>

<p>The eShop game page for GRID Autosport includes the following notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updated 06/19/2025 - "Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update."</p>

<p>GRID Autosport originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">made its debut on the Switch in 2019</a>, with a multiplayer update patched in at a later date. While the performance was already decent on the Switch, the experience should be even more enjoyable on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This is one of many third-party Switch titles to benefit from Nintendo's latest firmware update for the Switch 2.

<p>According to updated listings, Nintendo has been able to work its magic and reduce the game's file size from 10GB down to 8.5GB. It's not all that much, but given the size of various other titles on the Switch 2, we're sure many users will appreciate the extra space.</p>
<p>Although this game is less than half the size of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (which had a file size of 21.9GB at launch) it will still be packed with many sub-layers to explore.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nojrui&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XVI" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/01c7eb5647920/final-fantasy-xvi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has supposedly hinted at bringing its latest mainline <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy</a> game to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936193603837346175">'Genki_JPN' on social media</a>, during a <a href="https://youtu.be/Zg-LRoukGVo">live stream broadcast</a>, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a></strong> producer Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro briefly touched on the game's future and how Nintendo is the only platform left to conquer.</p>
<p>It's led to plenty of speculation online, with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/page-3">some Final Fantasy fans already convinced</a> a "Switch 2 port" could be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Before anyone gets too excited, Square Enix's current focus is on bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Intergrade</a></strong> to the Switch 2 this Winter. The tactical RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is also scheduled to arrive in September.</p>
<p>Following its PlayStation 5 and PC release, Final Fantasy XVI was made available on Xbox Series X|S earlier this month and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/according-to-sales-estimates-final-fantasy-16-had-a-rough-first-week-on-xbox">it's got off to a rough start (in terms of sales)</a> as highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This apparent tease follows on from Yoshi-P previously mentioning how a Nintendo release of Final Fantasy XIV Online <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">could be on the cards</a>. For now, though, nothing has been officially announced or confirmed about either of these Final Fantasy games coming to Nintendo's platforms.</p>
