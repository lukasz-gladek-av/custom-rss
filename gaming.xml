            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tides-of-annihilation-was-released-on-xbox-%E2%80%93-and-then-it-wasn%E2%80%99t.1110351/</guid>

<p>Recently, eagle-eyed gamers spotted a listing on the Xbox Store for Tides of Annihilation, the new hack-n-slash title revealed by Eclipse Glow Games at the State of Play showcase. This ambitious, post-apocalyptic title turned heads for its representation of a tantalising combination between Stellar Blade and Elden Ring.</p>



<p>The listing on the Xbox Store surfaced without warning and even had a price point associated with it – a modest sum of $22.49. However, gamers trying to purchase the game were met with something of a digital stonewall.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-yet">Not Yet</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation isn’t out yet – and presently, nobody knows when it will be released. When it <strong>does drop </strong>it’ll be on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3li4itlcsfx2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Wario64 shared an image of the Xbox Store, showing that Tides of Annihilation had seemingly been released and had a price point of just $22.49. This encouraged gamers to try purchasing the game, but they were met with nothing but a stonewall and a 300 MB ‘placeholder’ file. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the transactions were carried out as expected, which means players were charged the $22.49 that they paid for the file.</p>



<p>It could have been that someone at Xbox was very excited about the prospect of Tides of Annihilation and pressed a button a little too early.</p>



<p>Here’s the most recent extended gameplay trailer for Tides of Annihilation, just to loop you in and set your expectations:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Tides of Annihilation is a mystical, post-apocalyptic title set in a torn rendition of London. The game’s protagonist, Gwendolyn, has an ethereal connection to spectral knights of Arthurian mythology and uses their powers to battle monumental and enormous boss characters.</p>



<p>I recently caught up with Eclipse Glow Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to ask them about</a> some of the core elements of Tides of Annihilation.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to stun gamers worldwide since debuting in December 2024. This free-to-play hero shooter has pulled in tens of millions of fans, dominating the charts and attracting all kinds of top-tier content creators and pro players. Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-host-400000-global-invitational-tournament/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $400,000 esports tournament</a> is already planned to take place.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Marvel Rivals’ developer, NetEase, offered up a tidbit of information regarding the future of the game, looking specifically at a PvE mode. This is one of the most talked-about topics in the community, but what’s the chance it’ll be added?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-yet">Not Yet</h2>



<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-says-theres-currently-no-plan-for-a-pve-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, NetEase’s producer, Weicong Wu, spoke about PvE mode for Marvel Rivals. It’s a feature that many players have requested, either to seek a lesser challenge or to potentially sharpen their skills for when they fight real players.</p>



<p>Here’s what Wu said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For now we don’t have any kind of a PvE plan, but our development team is continuously experimenting with new game play modes. So if we found that a new specific game mode is entertaining enough, fun enough, we would of course bring it to our audience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>NetEase is aware of the demand, of course. Wu explained, ‘We believe there are some of our audience that would like the PvE mode.’ For now, the team at NetEase is ‘continuously experimenting’ with ways to please everyone and one proposed solution is a ‘lighter mode’ instead of a full-blown PvE experience.</p>



<p>It was revealed in the same interview, which took place at DICE in Las Vegas, that the developer is ‘open’ to bringing Marvel Rivals to Nintendo Switch 2, which would be a boon for the platform.</p>

<p>Team BDS is the first organisation to qualify for the grand final at the Six Invitational 2025, which will unravel tomorrow in Boston. Following a solid run through the upper bracket, Team BDS has found a spot in yet another pole position and remains the favourite to win the event and claim the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>To get there, Team BDS had to throw the likes of Unwanted and FURIA into the lower bracket. Both of these teams now stand a chance of squaring up against Team BDS once again to deliver an age-old tale of revenge, but FaZe Clan could also surface in the grand final.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-long-left">Not Long Left</h2>



<p>Today, two matches will play out, the first being a clash between Unwanted and FaZe Clan. From there, the winner will play FURIA for a spot in the grand final. One of these three teams will face off against a dominant Team BDS, which finds itself in a grand final for the fourth time <strong>this season</strong>.</p>



<p>Last year, Team BDS secured the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, earning a prestigious place in the gaming history books.</p>



<p>Team BDS has enjoyed a solid streak through the Six Invitational, which is one of the biggest and most valuable esports tournaments in the world. The squad topped the charts in the group stage, and as the team steamed through the playoffs bracket, it forced Unwanted, Spacestation, and FURIA into the elimination bracket after earning a bye thanks to group seeding.</p>



<p>This could be Team BDS’ first Six Invitational Win. Currently, every team in the running except FaZe Clan has never seen a grand final at the Six Invitational. Here’s a spread of the past winners of the Six Invitational:</p>



<ul>
<li>2017 – Elevate &amp; Continuum</li>



<li>2018 – PENTA</li>



<li>2019 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2020 – Spacestation</li>



<li>2021 – Ninjas in Pyjamas</li>



<li>2022 – TSM</li>



<li>2023 – G2 Esports</li>



<li>2024 – w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Team BDS can break through the grand final and lift the hammer in Boston? Right now, the team is <strong>guaranteed to win </strong>at least $450,000. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s developer, MADFINGER Games, continues to innovate and expand Gray Zone Warfare, one of 2024’s most impressive shooters. In April 2024, Gray Zone Warfare emerged to a positive reception, presenting a tactical shooter experience bursting with realism and intensity. It has since sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 1.5 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at MADFINGER revealed the next lineup of improvements and changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare. The first port of call for these changes is the game’s test server, but if all goes well, they’ll be deployed across the full game soon enough.</p>



<hr>







<p>Gray Zone Warfare is being pieced together with the community in mind, and stacks of feedback have been taken on board and actively considered by the developer. Last year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with MADFINGER’s CEO to ask him about the state of play for Gray Zone and the extraction shooter market in general.</p>



<p>While Gray Zone isn’t <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter, it does have mechanics that align it quite nicely with the genre.</p>



<p>Here’s what MADFINGER is testing in the latest test server patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of a ‘repair feature’</li>



<li>Easier progression to max vendor level</li>



<li>Better disconnect protection</li>



<li>Better item and body behaviour and physics</li>
</ul>



<p>The first feature on that list is the most widely requested note in the Gray Zone Warfare community. When implemented, it’ll allow users to patch up their equipment instead of paying a costly price to replace items. As you can expect, items can be repaired, but each successive repair will degrade the overall max quality rating of that item.</p>



<p>MADFINGER’s intent to strengthen disconnect protection in the game is also a nice inclusion. Many modern shooters feature this mechanic, and it means that if you disconnect while playing, you’ll load back up with the option to continue where you left off.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare has a solid development pipeline lined up, and the passion evident in MADFINGER is a wondrous thing. Have you given Gray Zone a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-zero-extraction-updates-canned-two-weeks-after-game%E2%80%99s-full-release.1110327/</guid>

<p>Level Zero Extraction has succumbed to one of the issues plaguing the wider industry. The developer behind the title – Doghowl – has taken to social media to announce that no further updates will be rolled out for this extraction shooter that emerged as a 1.0 release just two weeks ago.</p>



<p>Level Zero Extraction was shaping up as a tasty, alien-fuelled competitor to Escape from Tarkov, but now, the developer has stressed that the ‘relatively small team’ cannot continue to sustain the game from a financial standpoint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-down-the-drain">Down the Drain</h2>



<p>Level Zero Extraction entered early access in August 2024, impressing players worldwide with an innovative take on the extraction shooter genre. In this game, players could assume control of ‘Mercs’ or fearsome aliens, loading into a raid and trying to loot their hearts out before successfully extracting again.</p>



<p>Like a few extraction shooters that came before, Level Zero Extraction failed to gain enough traction to sustain the title.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, just 10 people are playing the game on Steam, and the title’s all-time peak sits at just 2,601. That’s a paltry condition compared to competing titles like Hunt: Showdown and Dark and Darker, both of which were floating between 10,000 – 12,000 players at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/LevelZeroGame/status/1890367933810966719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the Doghowl team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, LZ:E has underperformed compared to our expectations. It’s no longer feasible for our relatively small teams to sustain the game from a financial standpoint. Therefore, it’s a hard but necessary decision to gradually wrap up support.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the servers will stay up and wipes will continue to happen, but no further updates will be applied to the game. Now, Doghowl looks to what’s coming next, with the team mentioning that it has plans to develop a new multiplayer title that’s based on a cooperative experience.</p>

Recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1igzcw4/marvel_rivals_leak_reveals_possible_pve_boss/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors have spread of a potential PvE boss fight</a>, leading some to speculate that a PvE mode is right around the corner.

But NetEase and Marvel say they have better things to do...like actually make the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, dataminers began sharing names of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">potential future heroes hidden in the code of Marvel Rivals</a>, a few of whom seemed to be confirmed pretty quickly as real when the Fantastic Four were officially announced. However, as the list of datamined heroes grew, a different rumor began to circulate in the community: some of the names were fake, planted there by developers to mislead dataminers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even now, there's disagreement in the community as to which, if any of the datamined characters are really being seriously considered for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently had the opportunity to directly ask Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu and Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo if they're secretly performing an elaborate troll. And while it sounds like there are no pranks being pulled here, we should still take all the names being found in the code with a grain of salt. Here's what Wu had to say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So firstly we want to say that we don't recommend anybody to make adjustments to the files [of the game]," he began. "Also, you can see that for each character's design actually we come through a very complicated process and we make a lot of concepts, trials, prototypes, development, et cetera. So there could be some information left in the code, and it might mean that we have tried those directions and they may appear or may not appear in our future plans. And whether or not they will appear in our future pipeline is highly depending on what kind of gameplay experience our players would expect in our game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Koo added, "If I could have a ten-year plan, it'd be great. But the team experimented with a lot of play styles, heroes. It was like there's someone doing scratch paperwork and then just left a notebook there, and someone [a dataminer] decided to open it with no context."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pushed a little, asking them point-blank if they were deliberately trolling people. Koo replied, "No. We would rather spend our time developing the actual game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same conversation, we also discussed how a character gets chosen to be added into Marvel Rivals in the first place. The two told me that the team plans updates roughly a year in advance, and is committed to keeping its current pace of adding new characters every month and a half. For each update, NetEase first looks at what type of character and skillset is needed to balance out the rest of the game and add variety to the roster, and come up with a list of several different possible additions. Wu told me that part of NetEase's strategy for achieving game balance is to focus less on aggressively tweaking existing characters to be perfectly fine-tuned, and more on adding new characters and experiences to keep things fresh, fill gaps, support characters that are a bit weak with new team abilities, or counter characters that might be a little too strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once they have a list of possibilities, NetEase then takes these suggestions to Marvel Games, and begin working on initial designs. From there, they look at what the community is currently excited about, as well as what's planned a year in advance in other Marvel divisions, such as if a big film or comic arc is coming that they can tie a character in with.

But its developer NetEase has been firm <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/marvel-rivals/mobile" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that it's not coming to Nintendo Switch,</a> leaving Nintendo players out of luck on joining in the fun. But what about the Nintendo Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had the opportunity to pose this question to Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu this past week at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas. And fortunately for Switch fans, it sounds like a Switch 2 release is a real possibility. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Wu put it: "We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on some development kits. And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that. The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay.

While we don't have too many details on its capabilities just yet, it appears to be a bigger and more powerful Nintendo Switch system.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98one-more-turn%E2%80%99-doesn%E2%80%99t-always-mean-a-game-is-good.1110264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-civilization-vii-one-more-turn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Longstanding conventional wisdom suggests that if you’re playing a game, and you intend to stop, but you succumb to the fallacy of “Well, just one more turn,” and then several hours pass, it’s a good game! After all, how else would something be able to sink its hooks so indelibly into your psyche? But while compulsion <em>can </em>be a sign of transcendent craft, it isn’t always. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about what happens when it’s not.&nbsp;</p><p>We convene on the eve – if we’re measuring in podcast time – of <a href="https://aftermath.site/stream-big-book-excerpt-twitch-dream-face-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my book release</a> (<em>Stream Big</em>, available <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wherever books are sold</a>) to talk mostly about other stuff. First up, Activision and former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-unfair-labor-practice-guns-cwa-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got into dustups with CWA</a>, the union that represents over 1,000 workers across Microsoft and Activision, with Kotick claiming that harassment suits against Activision Blizzard were “fake,” engineered to juice CWA membership. Meanwhile, over here in the real world, CWA is working to get an Activision employee his job back after he was <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-unfair-labor-practice-guns-cwa-call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired (allegedly) for talking about guns</a>… at the company that makes <em>Call of Duty</em>. Hmmmm.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <em>Civilization VII</em>, which Luke <a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has many, many thoughts about</a>, none of them positive. The game feels distinctly unfinished, he says – a sign of the times when even such a ubiquitous series no longer commands the time and resources necessary to emerge from the oven fully baked.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Chris tells us about a thing that rules: <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lies of P</em></a>, the Pinocchio-themed <em>Bloodborne</em>-like that’s receiving DLC in the near future. Then we wrap it up by talking about our favorite interview moments, some of which might tie into my book (what are the odds?).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Luke can design the perfect 4X strategy game, and I can shut up about my book forever.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think you said this, as have some reviews: <em>Civilization VII</em> still has that <em>Civ </em>quality of making you want to play it for very long periods of time – of being very compulsive. But where’s the line between that compulsiveness and it being enjoyable to play?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> This is something that I’ve come to learn playing this game in particular: “One more turn” is kind of <em>Civ</em>’s unofficial battlecry – like “Oh, this game is so good, you always want to click one more turn.” That’s a psychological ploy that all 4X games can use. Even the bad ones. They’ve all got that pull, and it’s not because the game’s good. It’s like a slot machine. It’s like being stuck at a table at a casino. You’re not necessarily enjoying what you’re doing, but you’ve been manipulated into clicking one more turn each time, because each time you click one more turn, a couple numbers go up or something else moves or changes.</p><p>The point isn’t that you’re clicking one more turn; the point is, are you enjoying yourself while you’re doing it? I got very tired of <em>Civ VI</em> a year or two down the line, but this is the first <em>Civ </em>where after a week, I was tired of it. I found myself playing games where I was clicking through one more turn and being like “I’m not enjoying this, but I’m clicking one more turn because I’m in that honeypot of the genre.”</p><p>I really wish we would stop speaking about it positively, as though on its own merits clicking one more turn is a badge of honor that you’ve made a good video game. It’s not. It’s a pulling mechanism that the whole genre is able to employ. <em>Millenia</em>, <em>Humankind</em>, and games that are nowhere near as good as <em>Civ </em>still have that in them. And so people that talk about this <em>Civ </em>having that like it’s got the juice? It doesn’t mean that this game’s got the juice. Because you walk away from four hours playing this game, and you’re like “Ugh, what did I do just now? I could have done something else. That wasn’t fun. That wasn’t enjoyable.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s so interesting because I think it mirrors a lot of other elements of modern culture. I feel the same way when I use something like TikTok. I’ll scroll, one video after another, for many hours. Two or three or even four. And then I’ll be like “What did I spend that time doing?” It’s a blank space in my mind because it was all so compulsive but also unmemorable. That’s the attention economy in a nutshell. It’s meant to absorb your time and your attention, but it’s not meant to imprint on you any further than that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Are we crediting Sid Meier with the creation of the attention economy? With <em>Civilization </em>in 1991?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep, that was his goal with the first design document back in the day: “It’s gonna lead to something called TikTok, and it’s gonna fuck everyone.”</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> “You won’t even need the games anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I just thought of the idea of, like, a gacha version of <em>Civilization </em>with MiHoYo-style waifus and shit.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans"><h3>They Can’t Stop Trans Art</h3></a><p>The Trump administration's attacks on arts institutions are bad, but they aren't the end</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fellowship-of-ring-trick-taking-game-review-tricksy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I first heard about the impending release of&nbsp;<em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game</em>&nbsp;I can't lie -- I was excited. As a huge fan of the world of Tolkien&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a huge fan of trick-taking games, I was ready for a fun beer-and-pretzels style card game. What I got instead from this game, designed by Bryan Bornmueller and published by Office Dog Games (one of Asmodee's in-house creative studios), was even more than I could have hoped for!</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game</em>, players dive into the world of&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings </em>as they&nbsp;take on the role of characters from&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, following along with the story through a series of thematic chapters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Fellowship Trick-Taking Game Stats:</em></p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 20 min per chapter</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Cooperative Trick-Taking</li>
	<li>Complexity: Low (but ramping up as chapters progress)</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h2>How Do I Play&nbsp;<em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-chapter-1-characters-large.jpeg?itok=BA7eVRUZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-chapter-1-characters-large.jpeg?itok=rG_DH4nJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first chapter of the game sees players taking on the role of Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalf, and Pippin!</figcaption></figure><p>To play the game, your table will begin by taking the relevant chapter card, and any associated character cards, and setting them out. Most chapters will include additional cards and have special, specific requirements needed for either setup, or to win the chapter. From there, the core gameplay revolves around this being a cooperative trick-taking game.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with trick-taking games, or just not used to hearing the terms, think classic playing card parlor games like Hearts or Bridge. Each player will have a hand of cards dealt randomly to them, and each card will have a suit (Hill, Mountain, Forest, Shadow, and Ring) and a value (from 1 - 8 for everything except Ring cards, which are 1 - 5).</p>

<p>Each chapter, the player controlling Frodo as the ring-bearer will lead the trick by playing a card from their hand. From there, each player in clockwise order has to play a card in that same suit if they can. If they don't have the matching suit, then they can play any other card. There's more to it than that, but I'll play the role of Gandalf here and spare you the crucial details. Essentially, your goal as a group, because this is co-op, is to complete the goals of each character, and any special requirements from the game itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-trick-example-large.jpeg?itok=C1roLKG8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-trick-example-large.jpeg?itok=kG4r4nHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's an example of a common first trick. Here, Frodo lead with the 5 of Forests, everyone else at the table has to also play a forest. Gandalf, with the 7 of Forests, wins this trick!</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't as easy as it sounds, as each character wants different things! Frodo, for instance, wins by having in his score pile a set amount of Ring cards based on player count. Sam wants to have in his pile of cards he's won a very specific numbered Hill card (because he's always thinking of home). Pippin, always the trouble-maker, wants to win the fewest tricks out of anyone in the chapter. And so on and so on...</p>

<p>As you complete a chapter, you'll move onto the next chapter, which may have you saying goodbye to certain cards (Fatty Bolger's only around for a moment, as is Tom Bombadil) and could introduce new characters. And that's at the center of what's so special about this game.</p>

<h2>Reaching Storytelling Heights</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, the way that gameplay mechanics mirror and mimic the core of the story is so inventive, it's clear that designer Bornmueller isn't just a huge fan of&nbsp;<em>LOTR</em>, but a close-reader of the text as well! Each chapter, you deal out cards randomly to each player, and the player who is given the 1 of Rings&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;to play as Frodo, mirroring Frodo's inability to escape his destiny as the ring-bearer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-frodos-1-ring-large.jpeg?itok=oVqzSCxG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-frodos-1-ring-large.jpeg?itok=8RPZefKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Frodo has the One of Rings aka The One Ring, and he has to win with rings to beat a chapter.</figcaption></figure><p>Another great example of this storytelling shining through the gameplay comes in the chapter where the characters meet Tom Bombadil. Not only are all of the Forest suit of cards removed to become a sort of enemy deck (as Old Man Willow attempts to snatch up the hobbits), but Bombadil himself plays with a bunch of extra cards, showing his rule/world-breaking power.</p>

<p>There are dozens upon dozens of other examples like this as you progress through the 18 chapters of the game, but all of this is to say that it's the perfect use of gameplay mechanics as storytelling. If you're super-familiar with the story of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship,&nbsp;</em>you'll get a real kick out seeing the characters and plot points you love brought to life via game rules.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Growing Difficulty, Growing Dread</h2>

<p>The first few chapters of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship Trick-Taking</em>&nbsp;take it easy on the players. For me and my playgroup, we were even worried that the game might focus so much of great storytelling that the challenge would be too light. But if the difficulty of our heroes' journey increases as&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;progresses, so&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;does the difficulty in this game! And by the time we met up with Old Man Willow, and the barrow wights we were often failing our chapters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-initial-characters-large.jpeg?itok=a8rB-hbU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-initial-characters-large.jpeg?itok=AuRIVWLw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at our boys!</figcaption></figure><p>But the beauty of this game is that failing a chapter isn't that big of a deal at all, you simply re-set up the chapter, re-shuffle and deal out the cards, and try again! And when I'm finally able to best a particularly tricky chapter, well that feels better than a float down the Anduin.</p>

<h2>Incredible Components</h2>

<p>Finally, I think it's particularly worth mentioning the quality of the components in the game. The tokens (used to designate when its okay to lead with Ring Cards, and show which characters have completed their objectives) are gorgeously decorated wood, the box itself holds the game in three distinct parts, and comes with three ribbons that are a super-effective way of "saving your progress," and the artwork is stunning! Designed to look sort of like Stained Glass, each card's artwork is rendered in bright, beautiful colors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-card-artwork-large.jpeg?itok=_urlaiKn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-card-artwork-large.jpeg?itok=wHEeu2lW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the kind of artwork, stylized and with a lot of personality, that we don't always get to see from tabletop games these days!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>The Fellowship Of The Ring Trick-Taking Game - Final Thoughts</em></h2>

<p>This is, by far, one of the best experiences I've had playing a trick-taking game. And to really make a big, bold statement, I think this might be one of the best experiences I've had playing a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;game! And I'm a huge fan of the Fantasy Flight card game, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/lord-of-rings-roleplaying-first-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;RPG</a>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-battle-of-edoras-review-horses-and-pitchforks" rel="nofollow">Games Workshop-produced <i>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</i></a>.</p>

<p>If you're a die-hard fan of&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>, you should already be playing this game! If you're a die-hard fan of trick-taking games, this may be as close to perfect as we've yet seen. Either way, other than a quick uptick in difficulty that may catch some players off-guard, this is just about as close to perfect as they come.</p>

<p>Fly, you fools, and grab a copy of this! It's only <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MSRP'ed at $25 from the Asmodee website</a>, and you'll get many, many hours of enjoyment and a fun challenge out of this one.</p>

<p>In this article, we're going to look at 5 different expansions for <em>Zombicie White Death</em>.

We've been fans of CMON's <em>Zombicide</em> franchise for a while, and along with the first <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-black-plague-review-old-school-zombie-slaying" rel="nofollow">Black Plague</a>, we've also covered the modern <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-2nd-edition-board-game-review" rel="nofollow">2nd Edition</a> and the awesomely thematic movie tie-in, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/night-of-living-dead-zombicide-game-review" rel="nofollow">Night of the Living Dead</a> version.</p>

<p>Divine Beasts is an abomination expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>It adds a divine beasts card to the zombie deck, and when drawn, starts off a chain of divine beasts spawns. The first beast to appear is the Vermillion Bird and it will activate for 3 turns, and if not eliminated, it disappears and the next beast spawns next turn until all 4 have appeared.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 beasts has 3 action cards for each turn they're in the game, along with unique rules to eliminate them. The Vermillion Bird for example needs to be hit with a single ranged attack. They each also have a unique effect, like the Black Tortoise which makes nearby zombies need 2 damage to be removed. Eliminating the beasts before they disappear earns the survivors a permanent skill.</p>

<p>The Crossfire Pack is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde.&nbsp;</em>It includes some crossbow-armed guards and zombies. The guards give the player activating them a Delayed Ranged Action card, which can be discarded any time during the zombies phase to perform a ranged attack on a zone. The Deadbolt Walkers add a new challenge for survivors, and when they activate, they target a zone with the most survivors up to 3 zones away.</p>

<p>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide </em>fantasy series, including<em> White Death,</em><em>&nbsp;Black Plague,&nbsp;</em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>This expansion features 2 new types of Zombies. The climbers can ignore ramparts, barriers, and ledges when moving, and can be a real menace when trying to defend against. The Terrorcotta Walkers are fantastically thematic and offer a great new challenge. At the start of each zombie phase, if there are 1 to 4 Terrorcotta Warriors in a zone, more spawn around them until there are 5. This means that you need to take out all 5 in a turn, otherwise, they'll keep coming back, and if you separate them, they'll start spawning multiple sets of 5.</p>

The Terrorcotta Walkers offer a unique and entertaining challenge, and the climbers add a new element to your games. While not as good as the Divine Beasts expansion, it adds some interesting depth.</p>

<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<i> Zombiecide Timecrash </i>expansion contains a load of new content and can be used with <em>White Death</em>, <em>Black Plague,</em> or <em>Green Horde</em>. In total, it contains 7 new heroes and their unique equipment, a new enemy type and a new necromancer, 10 new quests, and some new rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll be honest, this is why I'm here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash and <em>White Death</em> is my thing, and it doesn't disappoint. Each Turtle feels thematically perfect (as does Splinter, April, and Casey) and each comes with their own unique equipment card, which can be upgraded by taking an ultimate token (a pizza slice, for which there are 6 that sit as a whole pizza when not in use).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemy-wise, the Foot Soldiers spawn on objectives to make them more difficult to take, and Shredder, a unique Necromancer, deals damage when survivors miss their attacks against him. These all combine in the 10 new quests, which use the included new map tiles and creates an enjoyable zombie-filled ninja romp through the snow.</p>

Incredibly thematic throughout with a load of content that works great in all <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The fantasy design for all the miniatures works very well and it's obvious that some work has gone into capturing the theme in all aspects of this expansion.</p>

<p><i>Zombicide Eternal Empire </i>is a fantasy expansion for<i> Zombicide. </i>It contains the most content out of all the expansions we've looked at here, including 6 new survivors, chi rules, and upgraded survivor cards for the <em>White Death</em> survivors (and rules for <em>Black Plague</em> and <em>Green Horde</em> survivors as well). It also includes a new action, meditation, which boosts Chi, and Chi Statues (that come in 2 halves to show when they've been broken by the zombies), and full replacement equipment decks that use the chi rules.</p>

<p>2 new zombie types are also included that play into the Chi theme. Warden Brutes, which make it so zombies can only be eliminated with chi attacks, and the God-Eater Abomination, who go straight for the Chi Statues and sap the chi from the survivors.&nbsp; Eternal Empire also adds new map tiles with ice zones that survivors can't attack in (zombies still can though), 10 new quests, and a campaign sheet and rules for linking your <em>Zombicide</em> games together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=tTKoGTjs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=FcYWvTbH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zombicide</em> Eternal Empire adds a huge amount of content to your games, and the Chi Statues that break in half are inspired design.</figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for how thematically awesome the Turtles expansion is, this would easily be the best of the new <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy expansions. It adds a huge amount of content to your games, even without the new enemies and survivors. The campaign play is fantastic, and the 10 new quests and their objectives are super fun to play through.</p>

<h2>Zombicide White Death Expansions Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The 5 <em>Zombicide</em> expansions we've looked at here can be divided into 2 types, the Divine Beasts, Crossfire Pack and Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers simply add new enemies (and guards) to your games. Out of those Divine Beasts adds the most interesting aspect to games, with the Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers adding a new great dimension and challenge. The Crossfire Pack is decent, but if you're only picking up one, then I'd recommend Diving Beasts.</p>

<p>The other 2 offer a lot more content in their expansions. Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Eternal Empire both have a great amount of content. Turtles is my personal favorite, just because it's so thematically brilliant, but Eternal Empire adds huge depth to your games, with new rules and campaign play. Recommending one over the other would depend on what you're after, but if it's just honest <em>Zombicide</em> fun, then Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is fantastic.</p>

But it ain’t just fans who have been waiting for a decade that are desperate for a <em>GTA 6</em> release date. Studio and publisher execs across the industry as well as smaller devs are watching closely, as nobody wants to release a game too close to <em>GTA 6 </em>and get demolished by it. As a result, everybody seems nervous about announcing a fall release date for their non-<em>GTA </em>games. And investors and analysts are watching to see if Rockstar’s behemoth lands in 2025 or slips into next year, something that would cause a lot of industry chaos.</p><p>Okay, so with seemingly everyone wanting to know when <em>GTA 6</em> will specifically launch, I’m here to provide a date. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A drumroll, please</a></span>...</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will launch on October 28.</p><p>Probably. Or, like, right around there. Pretty close to that point.

And October 28 is the last Tuesday of the month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a month in which Rockstar has historically</a></span> released a lot of its biggest games. But this isn’t just a random guess based on the fall 2025 release window and Rockstar’s past game releases. </p><h2 id="h237"><a id=""></a><em>Borderlands 4</em> and Take-Two’s CEO</h2><p>Earlier this week, 2K Games and Gearbox announced the release date for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044"><em>Borderlands 4.</em></a></span> The co-op sci-fi looter shooter is set to arrive on September 23. Why does that matter? Well, Take-Two Interactive is the parent company for both Rockstar and 2K Games. So unless Rockstar Games is completely rogue and never communicates with Take-Two leadership, I’d imagine they know when <em>GTA 6</em> is landing, even if it’s just a rough window. And that would likely help inform when they would choose to launch <em>Borderlands 4. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Stephen Totilo’s <em>Game File </em>on February 13</a></span>, there was a lot of excitement and chatter at DICE during the week due to the announcement of <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s release date. Totilo reports that a “well-plugged-in attendee” that he spoke to at the industry event explained that “everyone’s waiting for Take-Two and Rockstar” to pick a release day for <em>GTA 6</em>. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a signal from Take-Two: September 23 and the weeks immediately before and after it are probably safe.</p><p>Pull out a calendar and that likely means <em>GTA 6</em> isn’t landing in September. Fall starts on September 22 and the next day <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches. So September is out. That leaves October and November. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically <em>Call of Duty</em> has arrived in November</a></span> and while <em>GTA 6 </em>is likely to outsell this year’s <em>CoD </em>sequel, I doubt Take-Two and Rockstar want that big of a game launching so close to <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>So with that in mind, and based on Zelnick sounding very committed to a fall release date, I think that points to a late October launch while <em>Call of Duty</em>, which is now owned by Xbox, probably moves into the middle of November. Remember, Xbox wants <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> to be a big hit as it’s a game that will likely sell a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000">Xbox Series S</a></span> consoles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..">The tiny Xbox is the cheapest way to play the upcoming <em>GTA</em> sequel</a></span>. </p><p>So there you go: <em>GTA 6 </em>is out on October 28. Or maybe Take-Two does an early access period for the game and the “official” release date is the 28th but it really arrives three days early on the 25th. Either way, I’m thinking this Halloween season a lot of people are going to be too busy causing mayhem in Vice City to go to any spooky parties. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The two also answered a few pre-submitted audience questions, including one that Barlog read to Druckmann about sequels: “How do you and your teams approach character development over multiple games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann’s answer, though, was surprising for someone who’s made quite a few sequels in his day: he doesn’t think about multiple games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's a very easy question for me to answer, because I never think about multiple games, because I'm the game in front of us is so all consuming,” he responded. “I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, ‘what if I never get to do another one?’...I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ten-year payoffs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann went on to explain that this is how he approaches everything, with perhaps the exception of the The Last of Us TV show since he already knows it’s going to have multiple seasons. So when sequels come around, instead of having a plan already in mind, Druckmann says he looks back on what he’s already done and asks himself what elements are unresolved and where the characters can go. “And if I feel like the answer is, they can't go anywhere, then I go, ‘I think we'll just kill them off.’</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/gettyimages-2172932657-1739566989717.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Neil Druckmann. Image credit: Jon Kopaloff/Variety via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm half joking, but we just find the next game. When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say, "How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?" And we have to come up with a new answer. And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog responded, saying he doesn’t work that way at all. Barlog says he has “way too much of the Charlie Day crazy conspiracy board of trying to connect and plan with all of these pieces,” and especially likes when he’s able to connect something he’s working on now with something he planned ten years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's just so magical, but it is absolutely, unequivocally the most unhealthy thing ever, because it is insanely stressful to try to fold and connect each of these pieces,” Barlog continued. “Because give or take five years, there's hundreds of people involved, and then a whole new group of people often are moved in on the next project. That's a bunch of different, and perspectives, and likes and dislikes that are going to negatively impact you setting something up that early. And they're going to be like, ‘Let's talk about this, because that was kind of the dumb. I don't know if I want to do that.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think for me that requires a level of confidence I just don't have,” Druckmann later responded. “Like this is going to be so successful, I know where this is going next. I'm like, I just want to focus on the next five days in front of me, let alone 10 years down the line.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The reason to wake up</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The fireside chat spanned a number of topics, with Druckmann and Barlog discussing their own experiences with doubt, and their respective creative processes for determining when an idea is “correct.” Later in the talk, they alluded to their feelings on their careers as they currently stand. Druckmann spoke on how he doesn’t want to go into TV or movies permanently, sharing this anecdote about his love for games:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since we're talking about TV, one time I gave some direction on Pedro Pascal. And I think he was frustrated by my direction, but he said it jokingly. He's like, ‘Do you like art?’ And I said, defensively, ‘Yeah, do you like art?’ And without missing a beat, he goes, ‘It's the reason to wake up in the morning. It's why I live and breathe.’ And to me, that's why we do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“...At times, I've had panic attacks. It's just so much stress, but you do it, because you love it so much. I love games so much. I love the stories we tell in games so much. It's the reason to wake up in the morning. It's why we do what we do, and despite all the negatives that come with it, sometimes the death threats and all the negativity and all those things, you just kind of dismiss those things and say, ‘Yeah, but I get to make games with the most talented people. How lucky are we?’”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/gettyimages-1968417204-1739567114001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cory Barlog. Image credit: Hannah Taylor/BAFTA via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann then turned a question on Barlog, pointing out Barlog’s storied career in light of the recent retirement of his colleague Ted Price. “When is it enough?...When is this compulsion enough? When have you proven yourself enough?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog gave a lengthy answer that got <em>real </em>real:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it ever enough? The short answer's, no, it's never enough. It is the voice in your head driving you more, and more, and more, and more…You struggle, you struggle, you work, you work. And it feels thankless, and you're not being heard. Or the thing you're doing doesn't resonate. Then you reach that point where this mountain you've been looking at it, you've been dreaming about, you've been aspiring to. Finally, you reach the summit of this mountain. And it's like the most amazing and horrible thing all at the exact same time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Is it ever enough? The short answer's, no, it's never enough.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because when you get to the top, this demon of obsession inside of your head doesn't shut up and let you appreciate the moment, the smell of the air, the sound of this sort of successful silence, that you've persevered, you've struggled, you've worked so hard to get all this. And so many people came together, and used this collective creative brain space to give birth to something that was only an idea, or a concept. And just enjoy, and revel, and see that you accomplished this thing, and you are at the top of the mountain. No. The demon just looks and goes, ‘There's another mountain over there that's a lot taller.’ Okay, well what next? You don't even often take that time. And I don't want to believe that it is intentional. It is this weird, I think silent, not so silent part of your individual makeup. The reason you're in this is because you can't stop. You're driving yourself forward, and to your detriment, to everyone else giving you the advice to stop, and pace, and you don't.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann echoed this sentiment, but softer, ending on an anecdote about Naughty Dog’s Jason Rubin. Upon his departure from the company, Druckmann remembers Rubin telling him that him leaving would create a space for everyone else to rise up behind him. “I think about those opportunities. Eventually when I am done doing this, it will create a bunch of opportunities for people. So for me, it's like I'm slowly rising up. I'm getting less involved on the day-to-day stuff, like on this project that I'm on…And eventually I think I'll just be able to remove myself. I don't know how long that will take, but I think about it. And I think about the opportunities I will create for next people to take on this stress, and take on their ideas, and be vulnerable and do all those things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog quipped back, concluding the talk: “Very convincing. I’m going to retire.”

Both were in the top five most-played games on the platform, alongside <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>. The company reported $1.09 billion spent by 295 million PC players on the Epic Games Store last year, but only $255 million of that went to third-party games. For comparison, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft estimated Valve’s annual revenue</a></span> at over $6 billion back in 2021.</p><p>So the Epic Games Store is still very much a <em>Fortnite </em>launcher with a ton of other cool stuff grafted onto it, but it’s certainly not <em>just</em> a<em> Fortnite </em>launcher. And with that in mind, the company also signaled what’s ahead for its digital storefront in 2025. The roadmap includes an overhaul of discoverability, new social features, the addition of pre-loading and a new download manager, as well as the ability to finally gift games to other people. </p><p>All of this is being done with the intent to seamlessly integrate it across an Epic Games Store mobile app as the company lobbies regulators the world over to force iOS and Android to play nice with it. We’ll see if, as that grand vision comes closer to being a reality, the Epic Games Store finally becomes a more central force to be reckoned with in PC gaming. For now, it’s still a great place to snag tons of cool games for free. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Afterlove EP is the new visual novel and/or broken hearts album from Indonesian developers Pikselnesia. It’s the sad, sleepy tale of a musician, Rama, who is trying to put his life back together and reconnect with his old bandmates in Jakarta a year after the death of his girlfriend, Cinta. The complicating factor is that Cinta isn’t entirely gone: she is a voice in Rama’s head, chatting to him throughout the game's 28-day storyline as though sitting next to the player on the other side of the screen. </p><!--more-->

<p>Afterlove EP is the original brainchild of Mohammad Fahmi, creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a> and What Comes After, who died in 2022. His colleagues at Pikselnesia have been reckoning with their own sorrow as they finish his game. I’ve been playing Afterlove EP for review, and while it’s a short game – maybe five to eight hours – in which you spend a lot of time listening to conversations, I’ve found it tough going. I’ve lost a few people myself, and this is pretty squarely a game about grief: exploring it, unpacking it, arguing about it, releasing it, or perhaps just existing with it. </p>
<p>As such, I’ve decided to miss this week’s review embargo and give the game the time it needs to settle in my head. But I feel confident in saying that there’s an interesting piece of narrative design here, presented in the form of evocatively scruffy hand-drawn art and accompanied by gentle indie rock music. If you fancy trying it out for yourself, you can find Afterlove EP on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599780/Afterlove_EP/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a thread of social media posts on X (formerly Twitter), Tolarian Community College announced this year's <a href="https://give.translifeline.org/campaign/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-2025-fundraiser/c658047" rel="nofollow">Trans Lifeline</a> fundraiser. It started with a simple request. Donate multiples of $4.00 to the fundraiser and you will be eligible to win one of ten <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Masters boxes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-fundraiser-giveaway-thumbnail.jpg?itok=IuwXBLyB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-fundraiser-giveaway-thumbnail.jpg?itok=x6VbLbda 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>An hour later, the fundraiser had raised $5,000. One day later, that amount increased to over $270,000. To commemorate this milestone, Tolarian Community College announced a series of thank-you gifts would be going out to certain donors.</p>

<p>Those gifts included gaming accessories like playmats and Infinitotokens. But mostly the gifts were sought after <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards and decks including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> Commander Deck, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-superdrop-announced-by-wizards-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Secret Lair</a>, a Zendikar Rising Collector's Box, and a Revised Counterspell card signed by Mark Poole.</p>

<p>The most recent update by Tolarian Community College exclaimed surprise at the Trans Lifeline fundraiser raising over $425,000. This puts the fundraiser close to its stated goal of $500,000.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trans-lifeline-hug-artwork.jpg?itok=kGvkG-WK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trans-lifeline-hug-artwork.jpg?itok=sPHndy6H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Trans Lifeline is a grassroots non-profit organization dedicated to offering direct emotional and financial support to transgender people in crisis. In addition, the organization's members are part of the transgender community. Their stated goals include keeping their members' identities anonymous and confidential, providing peer support, and dismantling the institutional bigotry of white supremacy.</p>

<p>The support for Trans Lifeline comes during a volatile time in the United States. Due to several executive orders by President Trump, transgender identity is being erased or actively overwritten. This includes the removal of "transgender" and "queer" altogether from the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/references-transgender-queer-removed-stonewall-monuments-webpage-rcna192204" rel="nofollow">Stonewall National Monument's</a> web page.</p>

<p>The Trans Lifeline fundraiser concludes February 15.</p>
