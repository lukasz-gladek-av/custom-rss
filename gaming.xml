            <p>In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're <em>both</em> on the surface.</p>
<p>Being a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.</p><!--more-->

<p>I'm writing this up partly because the press release does, indeed, call the game "Foddian", and I love that this is a thing now. I love that Bennett Foddy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">game-length exercise in punching you in the hands</a> has become a genre. I love that developers are doing this to us, the Gamers - we definitely have it coming. In fairness, Ascending Inferno seems relatively gentle for a Foddlike. It's more of a traditional 2.5D platformer, with luscious voxel and pixel art, and mechanics specific to certain levels. That said, it does rely entirely on ball physics.</p><p>The setup is that you're a Goth footballer called Dani, who is trying to rescue her brother Vincent from Hell. Vincent, unfortunately, no longer has a body. He's an ectoplasmic orb with eyes. On the upside, this means he can't independently get himself into trouble, like many an NPC in an escort quest. On the downside - nine realms deep, to be exact - this means that he is quite capable of rolling and tumbling all the way to the bottom of the level. "It's not enough to run, jump and platform your way out of Hell - you'll need to dribble, kick and header [as well]" gloats <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442820/Ascending_Inferno/">the Steam page</a>. Yeah, screw you too.</p>
<p>Again, I don't think this is as Foddable as some of the Fodder I've encountered. It doesn't look nearly as soul-crushing as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pushing-it-with-sisyphus">Pushing It! With Sisyphus</a>, and there's no multiplayer like in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a>, so it won't even ruin all your real-life friendships.</p>
<p>I also really like the obvious fun the developers have had with the realms of the afterlife, each pilfered from Dante's Inferno and equipped with its own visual direction. The trailer gives us a few glimpses: Gluttony is a squalid diner, Lust is a heaving nightclub, Fraud is like a rundown Castlevania themepark. It makes me want to play a Sonic The Hedgehog game set in hell. That's where a lot of Sonic games belong, in fairness.</p>
<p>Ascending Inferno is out today. I guess, given the headline reference, I should end by discussing the music. It seems pretty passable to my unsophisticated ears, like Vangelis but rockier. I probably wouldn't give somebody their beloved's soul back if they played this at me, but I might offer them a consolation prize like, I don't know, the soul of a budgerigar, or perhaps an eHarmony coupon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Three years ago, the Software Preservation Network and the Video Game History Foundation put forth a petition to the US Copyright Office to allow libraries to share the out-of-print video games in their possession with researchers remotely. However, that request has now been denied, and it means this battle to keep out-of-print games alive has come to an end.</p><p>The copyright office sided with the Entertainment Software Association and other video game lobbyists' argument that letting libraries share digital access to their titles would lead to "a significant risk that preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes." Essentially, the argument is that researchers enjoying the remote games would constitute copyright infringement.</p><p>The Video Game History Foundation <a href="http://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a statement</a> decrying this decision while pointing out that it helped prove that "around 87 percent of video games released in the United States before 2010 remain out of print." Video Game History Foundation founder and director Frank Cifaldi also shared his own statement, <a href="https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/1849869475782459704" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, "I'm proud of the work we and the orgs we partnered with did to try and change copyright law. We really gave it our all, I can't see what else we could have done. This fails the needs of citizens in favor of a weak sauce argument from the industry, and it's really disappointing."</p><p>The copyright office's decision also stated that giving libraries the asked for exemption would potentially harm video game companies' attempts to repackage and sell their older legacy titles to modern consumers. But as noted by the VGHF, even companies like Nintendo have let many older titles fall out of print or remain unavailable to consumers as downloadable titles.</p><p>It's unclear if video game preservationists can take any steps to challenge this decision. Meanwhile, the ESA already announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-esa-says-its-members-wont-support-the-one-form-of-game-preservation-that-might-actually-work/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it opposes any compromise about sharing out-of-print games</a> remotely among researchers.</p>

			<p>Starfield 2 is going to be one hell of a game, according to a former Bethesda designer who worked on The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, as it will address much of the original game's criticism.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/starfield-2-one-hell-of-a-game-claims-designer-bethesda/?callback=in&amp;code=ODE2ZJC2NZYTM2Y4MC0ZMMJKLWI3NGQTZWUXMZU4NJBMNJMW&amp;state=22be1898c559444ca029c628e9f2b835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer</a>, Bruce Nesmith commented on the franchise, which was launched last year, highlighting how it has the chance to reach the same heights as The Elder Scrolls series over time. When the studio built Skyrim, they had the "tremendous advantage" of Oblivion, which, in turn, had the advantage of Morrowind. All the team had to do was continue to improve the formula and add new stuff, an advantage that Starfield did not have. For this reason, Bruce Nesmith is really looking forward to the second entry in the series, which he feels will be one hell of a game because it is going to address a lot of the things the original game is close to getting right. The sequel will be able to take everything that is in the original game, put new stuff in it, and address its issues. In a lot of ways, Starfield may end up becoming the next Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed, two series that had some troubled beginnings but then went on to become some of the most appreciated gaming series ever with multiple sequels.</p>
<p>It is indisputable that Starfield needs something more to become a memorable series like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Too many issues prevent the first game from reaching its full potential, and these issues have only become more evident over time, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review of the Shattered Space expansion.</a></p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has released a new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update by the name of Crimson Eye, and as well as getting the game ready for its long-awaited console release, it's also bringing some pretty big changes.</p>

<p>After being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">times</a>, a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console release was confirmed for 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike">back in July</a>, and earlier this month, Kinetic revealed that the multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game would finally be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on October 29th, which is, well,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KineticGamesDev/status/1847186876119027991" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tomorrow</a>.</p>

<p>Ahead of that release, the Crimson Eye update has been deployed, and it's introducing a new Halloween weather type by the name of the Blood Moon, which makes ghosts stronger but brings brand new rewards with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-darkness.jpg?itok=Yvl7esPv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update-darkness.jpg?itok=KUlPpLab 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s new Halloween event is sure to scare you, just in time for Halloween.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the Halloween Blood Moon event, you're also getting a brand new Event Board to help track in-game challenges. You can find it in the Warehouse, and it's worth spending a bit of time with it if you're a&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>regular, because some things have been moved around to accommodate it.</p>

<p>The game's physics have also been upgraded; doors should no longer push you in or out of locations, and low-FPS players won't clip through the floor anymore in Point Hope. That is...assuming they're not ghosts, of course.</p>

<p>Plenty of other changes have been incorporated as well, including sweeping optimizations that result in "higher performance and more consistent frame rates", among other things. You can check out the full Crimson Eye <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-crimson-eye" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a> if you wish.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game in which you and your fellow hunters must venture into haunted locations to document the spirits that haunt them.</p>

<p>You're armed with an arsenal of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and that equipment can be upgraded. There are a range of spooky creatures and locations to discover, so if you're looking for the perfect Halloween treat to play with your friends,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>might well be it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for the offline version of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>, as well as a ton of other details regarding how the game will work once its servers are turned off.</p>

<p>Back in August, Nintendo revealed that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november">would be taken offline</a>, but the gaming giant also announced that an offline version of the game would be made available sometime following the shutdown.</p>

<p>That online version is arriving on December 2nd, it turns out, and it'll cost you $20, although that cost is being reduced to $10 for the first two months or so of the game's release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-campsite.jpg?itok=XMT9xfZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-version-campsite.jpg?itok=s28gl1Am 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is going offline soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Dubbed&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete</em>, the offline version will essentially allow you to play&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>in its entirety without the need for an online connection.</p>

<p>The new version won't have any in-app microtransactions, either, and if you've already been playing&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, you'll be able to "retain access to a majority of the items and events" in the original online version of the game.</p>

<p>New features will also be added, including QR-based Camper Cards, which you can use to scan your friends and add them to your card list. Once they're on there, you might see them show up in the all-new Whistle Pass area, where you can also enjoy a daily concert by none other than legendary musician K.K. Slider.</p>




<p>Since the original&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is online, there will, of course, be a number of features you won't be able to use anymore when the offline version arrives.</p>

<p>You can't play alongside your friends online anymore; the versions of them you see in Whistle Pass will be offline avatars rather than the players themselves. Leaf Tickets and the Pocket Camp Club subscription service also won't be available, and Leaf Tickets won't be transferred over to the new version either.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quiet-place-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more.1020897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/quiet-place-road-ahead-review-say-less-do-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who said movie tie-in games were dead, eh? Sure, they tend to not come out at the same time as the movies anymore, and their longstanding legacy as mere “shovelware” may undermine whatever qualities they have, but the keyword here is “vigor”. Intent is never detached from passion, and inspiration forms in so many different ways, which is what <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> aims to prove.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Italian developers Stormind Games; a new story set within the <em>Quiet Place</em> universe, and fresh off the heels of the warm reception of the most recent film, <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>. This isn’t Stormind’s first foray into the horror genre either, as they were responsible for the rather underseen <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/remothered-broken-porcelain">Remothered</a> </em>games that came out in 2018, and 2020, respectively. If anything else, <em>The Road Ahead</em> is looking promising.</p>

<p>You play as Alex, a young lass who is hiding from the nearly-invulnerable “Death Angels”, along with her father Kenneth, her partner Martin, and Martin’s mother Laura. Taking place 4 months after the aliens crashed down on Earth and ravaged the planet, Alex finds out she’s pregnant with Martin’s child, the aftermath of which causes a fissure between the 4, driven deeper when Martin sacrifices himself to save her from a Death Angel attack.</p>



<p>It seems like a pretty heavy plot, right? There’s a lot of human tension on display, not unlike the themes present in the films. With that said, I have to get into the story – not just because of its similarity to the plot of the first film – but because of its rather asinine explanations for conflict. There seems to be dropping off points for logic as characters hedge all their bets on Alex being the supreme negative force in their post-apocalyptic shambles of a life.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pieces put in place before and during the game’s chain of events that are explained so briefly, and without a tertiary mention until it’s brought to court. Halfway through the game, Laura goes into a tirade about Alex being a disaster case that’s never really set up, or proven true as time goes on. Hell, the game seems to promise human raiders at several points which never comes to fruition either.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, it’s a throwback type of horror situation: A first-person game of hide and seek with the Death Angels, similar to your <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outlast-2"><em>Outlast</em></a>’s or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/observer"><em>Observer</em></a>’s in that there’s no way to really fight back against your foe. You are practically a walking conduit of noise at all times, which <em>The Road Ahead</em> executes with an immense variety. Flares, wind-up flashlights, puddles of water, autumn leaves, tin cans, barrels, doors that have not been lubricated once since they were put into place, latches, and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>It’s certainly worth commending the number of ways <em>The Road Ahead</em> wants you to think about soundplay, even if it is to the point of completely arbitrary nonsense. The level design suffers as you can see the clear path of intent with each new area, where Death Angels can focus on sound traps, although as time goes on, that becomes an issue for the Death Angels too. When they’re forced into a playground to be a constant threat, there’s a good chance that their monstrous hit boxes will create sound by themselves, spooking them constantly.</p>

<p>The crowning jewel is the microphone gimmick, inspired by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/alien-not-aliens-why-isolation-right-move"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a> mechanic, and working exactly the same. If you have a microphone plugged into your controller or PC, then any noise made will be picked up by the game, and will be a direct source of noise for the Death Angel to grab. In execution, it plays out exactly how you’d expect – that is to say, a reminder of how little <em>The Road Ahead</em> trusts you with it.</p>

<p>In <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, the Xenomorph wasn’t stupid, but they were still bound by the game's rules and structure. You had time to escape if you accidentally just belched into the microphone after necking the last bit of your rum and coke. In <em>The Road Ahead</em>, any large amount of noise is immediately met with a game over, and I’m not talking about the Death Angel merely spawning in – the game will wrestle control from you and force a death, regardless of where you stand.</p>



<p>This is another one of those double-edged sword situations, where unless the game explicitly states it, safety isn’t guaranteed; a noble cause that reminds players of the hopeless situation. At the same time, however, <em>The Road Ahead</em> doesn’t trust the player with a single inclination that isn’t explicitly set up by the game itself. Constant tutorials regarding mechanics, text logs everywhere which reinforce said tutorials, before AND after it’s been stated.</p>

<p>Throughout your average 5-hour long playthrough, you will be bombarded with these gameplay-interrupting tutorials – right until the very end of the game – a total of 51 times, which is frankly insane. Whenever you perform a contextual button press, camera control will be wrestled from you. Whenever you enter a new area, chances are you’ll be forced to look at the scary thing. There’s an objectivity presented as fact which I personally cannot stand, and I’m not scared, just annoyed.</p>

<p>There’s one other unique mechanic <em>The Road Ahead</em> possesses, and that’s inhalers. Early on, it’s revealed that Alex is an asthmatic, and regularly needs one-time-use inhalers so as not to trigger an asthma attack which can point Death Angels in her direction. If one does happen, then I <em>think </em>you have to pull off a brazen QTE, and I use the word “think” because, despite two playthroughs, I couldn’t get one to trigger once through natural gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s such an overwhelming experience to sit through, and I don’t use that word lightly. Constant demand to vary the gameplay up, none of it ultimately providing the same solution as simply crouch walking. It even breaks the universe’s own rules at a certain point, with no other explanation than to justify a truly pathetic emotional climax that it doesn’t earn, which I feel sums up the entire experience perfectly.</p>

<h2><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>The Road Ahead</em> feels like it demands to be a fearful experience, to be a heart-wrenching story to listen to, and rarely will it put the work in to prove that. It’s a slog to sit through even at 5 hours long, it’s a haunted house ride that provides a teleprompter when it wants you to be scared, and it refuses to let you see the game with your own eyes.</p>

<p>Not unless there’s a tutorial on how to open them, at least.</p>

<p>Max Reisman and Judas and the Black Messiah's Lucas' brothers are reportedly on board to write the screenplay based upon the cult game.</p>
<p>The Oregon Trail is a 1980s strategy game in which the player leads a wagon train down the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri, to Willamette Valley, Oregon, in 1848. The copyright for the game currently sits with book publisher HarperCollins.</p>

		<p>It’s been a few years now since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> took the PC streaming scene by storm, the scrappy indie effort enrapturing watchers with a mix of tense and spooky ghost detecting and then screaming and running around as doors slammed, lights went out and ghosts went on the hunt. Now that game is coming to console… but it’s still in Early Access.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phasmophobia - Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLCwws1HnYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Phasmo (as it’s colloquially called) is quite a mature game for an Early Access title. It’s four years old now, there have been countless updates to it, balance patches, new additions and seasonal events. In fact, it’s launching on console during the Blood Moon event, where a bunch of levels have been bathed in red candles, weird glowing orbs, and streams of… loo roll?</p>


<p>We started at the very beginning, though. Nic, Gamoc and myself had never played Phasmo on PC, and my main knowledge comes from hearing some of its most popular streamers play in the background. In other words, I knew the gist, but not the specifics.</p>


<p>The first half dozen ghost hunts were awkward fumbles in the dark. Between not knowing how each contraption is meant to be used (outside of a relatively straightforward tutorial), trying to figure out what is and isn’t a sign of a ghost, and generally stumbling around with the lights turned off, it initially feels about as underwhelming as a real haunted house visit.</p>
<p>Sure I’m wandering around with an EMF reader, peeping through a video camera with night vision turned on, or triggering questions on a static-filled Spirit Box, but there’s nothing happening… until there is.</p>
<p>When you find those first flickers of activity, you can put everything together, try to figure out what’s a meaningful clue, check things off in the Journal and hopefully guess what ghost it is correctly.</p>
<p>Except you don’t necessarily have long. Whatever the spectre, they have little patience for your intrusion. Going off on a hunt as you spend more time in there and your sanity meter depletes (staying in the light helps, but then the ghost won’t want to play so much), until they come for you and try to kill you, their hands creeping in from the side of your vision. Then you’re a ghost, albeit one that’s not so malicious to your still living buddies.</p>
<p>A big part of that initial fumble is with the game controls and figuring out how to actually use things. There’s a few quirks, like placing a camera to keep recording, or a notebook for ghost writing needing the left trigger, there’s a mental jump for which buttons are used for interactions, it’s all too easy to drop items when simply trying to back out of using them, and then picking back up off the floor needs absolute precision, and crouching to do so.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of rougher edges that want improving, such as navigating the book-like Pause menu / journal with shoulder buttons throwing you to weird places in its structure. The pre-level UI for managing the van inventory is also hampered by the achingly slow Destiny-style cursor, something which has plagued in console gaming for far too long now.</p>
<p>It’s in these areas that it still feels like an early access game, but it can all be improved.</p>
<p>So can the introduction to the game. The tutorial is fine for showing intended uses, but doesn’t really hammer things home in context. When the game says “Freezing Temperatures” as a clue, it really bloody means it – +1°C ain’t freezing, buddy – and the same for EMF reading of over 5.</p>
<p>Reading the clues for new players is tough, given how fleeting they can be, or how directed you need to be with a device, and that can lead to a lot of supposition and wrong guesses. It’s frustrating to feel like you had all three clues you need, only for it to be something completely different. Heck, there’s a bunch of ghosts in the game, which are purely there in an effort to misdirect and addle expert players and streamer – a big part of the game is learning to look beyond evidence for a ghost’s personality, to let you identify them with minimal clues.</p>
<p>While the game has difficulty levels, and ranking up gradually unlocks new haunted houses and grants access to better gear, it’s overwhelming to have two dozen ghosts from the off. A better game introduction might give an initial clue to you, whether that’s stating a room that the ghost was in or saying that the owners noticed a particular bit of evidence, just to set newcomers on the right path. It could also limit the range of ghost possibilities to help ease you in.</p>
<p>But as you slowly push yourself up that learning curve, things start to come together. After half a dozen rounds of really not getting it, and after multiple deaths, you start to figure out how to play, how to band together. Things like having one person in the truck looking for ghost activity, like putting the DOTS and camera together in a room and leaving them to be viewed remotely, and just quickly pooling all the tools together once you’ve found where the ghost lives.</p>

<p>I had the most fun with the earliest farmhouse levels. They feel more active, for one thing, despite being larger, and they’re much darker without lights on, ramping up the tension a bit. This was also where we found the first Ouija board to commune with the ghosts directly, the first hilariously bad ghost photo – literally just a few projected green dots that are barely discernible – and the first time the bouncy fun of a ghost hunt really hit home. There’s a reason why Phasmo has now been followed on by games like Lethal Company and Content Warning. Silly spooky times with your friends are fun!</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of rough edges from adapting the controls to gamepad, and from that initial learning curve, but Phasmophobia is absolutely that kind of game – grab a few friends, go to a spooky house, and run around in the dark calling out to “Susan” or whatever their name was. You’ll have a hell of a time while you do.</p>

            <p>I've often thought lighthouse keeping would make a fine second career, albeit mostly because in my head, it would give me endless time to write (and finish Baldur's Gate 3). You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. </p>
<p>Going by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers, Please</a>, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. "It's consuming my team!" screams a self-described ship captain. "Please, send help! Gosh..." Look, "friend", no genuine human being says "gosh" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say "gosh" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.</p> <!--more-->

<p>Static Dread is the work of small Serbia-based independent Solarsuit.games, and features art design from a former Total War: Warhammer artist. Expect "a dynamic storyline with impactful player choices, leading to diverse scenarios and multiple endings". You aren't chained to the radio. You can get up and explore the suspensefully wonky, Tim-Burton-esque contours of the lighthouse. Sometimes, there's a knock at the door. Seems like you'll mostly want to ignore those. There's also a locker you can hide in.</p><p>The developers have "integrated technical solutions from a larger RPG project" - I imagine they're talking about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1735880/Drake_Frontier">Drake Frontier</a>, a "Space Western action RPG featuring real-time combat, organic roleplay, and a deep narrative". There's a Static Dread playtest scheduled for January, but no release date for the full game yet. If you're keen on the emerging subgenre of Papers, Please-alikes, I strongly recommend you have a look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s a lot of great <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons to unlock in Black Ops 6</a>, but the Kompakt 92 is one of the last weapons you’ll unlock on your way to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige</a>. It’s a very close-range SMG with a lot of potential, but you’ll need to use the best attachments, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perks, and Equipment</a> to get the most out of it.</p>



<p>With that said, here’s the best Kompakt 92 loadout to use in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-kompakt-92-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Kompakt 92 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Integrated Suppressor Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>For our best <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> Kompakt 92 SMG loadout, you’ll want the <strong>Integrated Suppressor Barrel</strong> as it keeps you off the enemy’s radar while also improving bullet velocity and damage range.</p>



<p>Next, the <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> tames the weapon’s strong vertical recoil, allowing you to stay on target while <strong>Extended Mag I </strong>gives you enough ammo to take on multiple enemies.</p>



<p>The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> provides a boost to handling, improving aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds. Lastly, the <strong>Recoil Springs </strong>Fire Mod provides more control for the gun’s rapid fire rate.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-kompakt-92">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Kompakt 92</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Overkill</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Molotov</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Sleeper Agent</li>
</ul>



<p>As the Kompakt 92 SMG is a very close-range weapon, I found it most effective when paired with Perks that improve mobility and handling. <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> improves your sprint speeds while reloading and using Equipment, <strong>Assassin</strong> reveals enemies on a kill streak, and <strong>Double Time</strong> greatly increases the duration of Tactical Sprint so that you can get behind enemy lines fast. </p>



<p>Using these 3 Perks also unlocks the <strong>Enforcer Combat Specialty</strong>, which is great for an aggressive SMG loadout such as this one, as it replenishes your health upon every kill and gives you a speed buff.</p>



<p>When it comes to Equipment, the <strong>Molotov</strong> is a Lethal that burns enemies on impact and leaves a deadly pool of fire behind for a short period, catching unsuspecting enemies who walk into it. For the Tactical, a Flashbang is perfect for breaching rooms and areas of the map when running and gunning.</p>



<p>Lastly, the <strong>Sleeper Agent</strong> Field Upgrade disguises you as an enemy teammate which is perfect for sneaking behind enemies and getting as close as possible before unloading the rapid-fire Kompakt 92 SMG.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> is an excellent Secondary to use with the Kompakt 92, as it allows you to take on enemies at those medium-to-long range distances where the Kompakt 92 struggles. </p>



<p>This, of course, is only possible with the Overkill Wildcard equipped, if you opt for a different Wildcard, the <strong>9mm PM </strong>Pistol<strong> </strong>has the best damage range of all the handguns in the game, so it’s a wise choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-kompakt-92-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Kompakt 92 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will need to reach <strong>Level 49</strong> to unlock the Kompakt 92 SMG in Black Ops 6. This may take some time, but if you continue playing objective-based game modes that get you a lot of XP, you’ll eventually reach the rank.</p>

You could also use the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a>, which is also a top close-range weapon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-5-guardians-pc-port-scrapped/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Halo 5: Guardians PC port was originally considered, but was later scrapped due to technical hurdles, according to a former member of the development team.</p>
<p>Former Halo developer Tyler Owens confirmed on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/heytred" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> that a PC port of the fifth entry in the popular Microsoft series was originally being considered but ran into "significant" tech hurdles and was later scrapped. The developer could not say which technical hurdles ultimately prevented the port, but there's a good chance it was due to the frame rate being tied to the physics, which was something that many developers were doing at the time the game was in development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I wish but it’s never going to happen imo. I think the port that was being considered ran into significant tech hurdles and was scrapped.</p>
<p>— Tyler Owens (@heytred) <a href="https://twitter.com/heytred/status/1850597419437916476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Probably, seems plausible - l honestly wasn’t as connected to high levels details on my role at the time.</p>
<p>— Tyler Owens (@heytred) <a href="https://twitter.com/heytred/status/1850598592324743322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While an official PC port of Halo 5: Guardians may never see the light of day, PC players will still be able to experience the game in some capacity in the future, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-5-guardians-pc/">XWine1 Xbox One translation layer</a>, which can already run the game in its current state. The layer has yet to be released to the public, but work is continuing <a href="https://x.com/XWineOne/status/1849794366216319198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily, </a>so it may not be long before the game will be available to players who don't have access to Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Halo 5: Guardians is now available on Xbox One, but it can also be played on any device that supports Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

Nintendo will sell the upcoming paid version of its smartphone Animal Crossing app for £18 ($20) after the closure of its current free-to-play edition next month.
</p>
<p>
However, to start with, an introductory offer will see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-pocket-camp">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a> Complete sold for half price - £9 ($10) - for its first two months.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Nintendo will launch Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete shortly afterwards, on 3rd December, which offers no in-game purchases and the ability to play offline. Its half-price launch offer will run until 31st January next year.
</p>
<p>
In a press release on the new version, Nintendo states that players will be able to "retain access to a majority of the items and events" from Pocket Camp's free-to-play version, with account progress transferrable - though only until 2nd June 2025. 
</p><p>
Leaf Tickets, Tom Nook's favourite currency for selling you premium items, the Pocket Camp Club subscription service and the ability to play with friends via online communication (such as selling items via a market box, and exchanging gifts) are all being discontinued.
</p>
<p>
New features for the Complete version include the fresh Whistle Pass location, where "friends and neighbours can enjoy activities including in-game live music performances". Huh! Is KK Slider going to introduce Eminem and Snoop Dogg, a la <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>? It seems unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Events with Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete will rotate on a four-year cycle, Nintendo said in a detailed video on the new version, above, meaning anyone hoping to collect all the app's stuff will be kept busy until 2028. With a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> version of Animal Crossing still likely years away - are you tempted to give Pocket Camp Complete a go?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/28/somehow-darksiders-2-is-one-of-the-best-games-of-all-time/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, I know. That’s a hyperbolic title, but we love hyperbole on the internet, right? Darksiders 2 has just re-re-released on current-gen consoles, with some love given to the code to make it as shiny and smooth as possible. That’s all well and good, but what this return really showcases, is just how good the game is, was and always will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition | PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXqem-g5ABs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s get the explanation out of the way. I have bought Darksiders 2 on every single platform that it has released on. It is one of the reasons – alongside Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and Xenoblade Chronicles – that I will never sell my Wii U, and that’s slightly mental when I can play it on Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One via backwards compatibility. And that’s before its newly enhanced release on PS5 and Xbox Series consoles – it’s a free upgrade to be a full cross-gen game now. The only place I can’t play it anymore is on Google Stadia, and I can just about live with that.</p>


<p>So, I like the game. A huge part of that is the artwork and design of Joe Madureira. The former Marvel Comics artist was Creative Director for the Darksiders series, and his ethos, outlook and chunky art style permeates the game. The opening cutscene is delivered via his distinctive comic-style artwork, and it immediately sets the tone for the series, while catching you up on the events of the first game.</p>


<p>It’s a genuine feast for the eyes, and the improved 4K resolution of the re-release means that it’s crisper and more vibrant than ever before. There’s now ray tracing and improved ambient lighting, and it all zips along at a fixed 60fps, so Death just feels slicker, looks better. In many ways, it just doesn’t look a game from two console generations ago, thanks to the Joe Mad’s timeless design.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that you don’t have to have played the first one, and while you definitely should if you want to make the most of the world, and to fully understand every element of the story, Darksiders 2 is the superior game in pretty much every way. With this current-gen upgrade, there’s now a chasm between the two.</p>

<p>You play as Death. He’s a gravelly-voiced, violent, and slightly conceited central hero, but he’s incredibly powerful, and unequivocally cool. He can utilise a host of extremely large weapons, zip around the battlefield, and climb and clamber across the landscape with ease, and he’s just a delight to control and embody. Few games have mechanics that are as solid and simply enjoyable as Darksiders 2.</p>
<p>That ties into the Zelda-like puzzling and exploration that carried over from the first Darksiders, while bringing a new dungeon-crawling outlook to loot, with a steady stream of slightly different weaponry and armour to sift through and equip, generally making Death look even cooler. If that’s even possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only point where you can tell this is an older release is in some of the animations. Death’s motorisation is noticeably less smooth than you’d expect in 2024, but you soon forget when lava creatures are trying to tear you limb from limb. The 60fps delivery also makes it feel fresher and more immediate, and Death almost feels lumpen and less agile going back to the previous PS4 Deathinitive version, never mind the original PS3/360 release.</p>

<p>There are elements of my Darksiders 2 obsession that are pretty inexpicable. I like Death’s voice way more than&nbsp; I should do – Michael Wincott delivering an outstanding performance that’s part-man, part-shingle beach – and it’s fundamentally a straightforward Xbox 360 adventure through a fantasy world, reminiscent of many games from the era.</p>
<p>But, and it’s a big BUT, Darksiders 2 overcomes any questions of age or mechanics by simply being hugely enjoyable. For me, it’s a living comic book, beautiful and intriguing, and just like your favourite graphic novels, Darksiders 2 deserves to be picked up and read, over and over again. With this new release, that’s only more obvious, and it genuinely makes it nigh-on essential if you’re a fan of fantasy action games.</p>
<p>I know, I’m as surprised as you are.</p>
