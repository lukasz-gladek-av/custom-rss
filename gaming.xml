            <p>President of Xbox game content and studios, Matt Booty, has claimed the company's competition no longer lies with other game studios and console developers, but "everything else".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html">The New York Times</a>, primarily discussing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">shock announcement that Xbox's longtime brand mascot, Master Chief, and exclusive first-party game, Halo, would be coming to PS5</a> in 2026, Booty said the decision came as a result of "seeking to meet people where they are", moving away from console exclusivity in a bid to reach more players.</p>

<p>"Our biggest competition isn't another console," Booty said. "We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.</p>
<p>"We are all seeking to meet people where they are."</p>
<p>It's a vastly different position to both Nintendo and Sony's PlayStation brand, both of which continue to avariciously guard their first-party exclusives, with Sony only recently experimenting with porting its console games to PC, albeit often months after their console debut.</p><p>Commenting on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from the company</a> during the summer, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace" at the time, Booty said: "Layoffs are difficult. They are a part of managing our business".</p>
<p>While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions remains unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMaz MMORPG</a> were cancelled, roughly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and have reportedly been replaced by the AI tools they helped to build. The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">Turn 10 Studios behind Forza Motorsport is also reportedly "no more"</a>, and the knock-on effect has also resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">funding being cut for Romero Games' next project</a>, though contrary to reports the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">studio has not closed</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft confirmed the Halo series is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. In a new demo debuted at the Halo World Championship, Microsoft revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved – described as "a faithful yet modernised remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>'s campaign" – is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next year. It marks the first time ever a Halo game will be released on a PlayStation system.</p>

            <p>Akira Yamaoka, long-time composer and sound design director for Silent Hill and a number of other games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lollipop-chainsaw">Lollipop Chainsaw</a>, is embarking on his first ever U.S. tour in February 2026.</p>
<p>Yamaoka will "bring his iconic soundtracks to life in a cinematic live performance experience" in a number of dates across the country. Internationally acclaimed singer, composer, and lyricist Raj Ramayya, who is perhaps best known for his work on Cowboy Bebop and Resident Evil, will be opening for Yamaoka each night of the tour. The pair have collaborated on a new single, Encrypted Code Reality, which is out on the suitably spooky date, 31st October.</p>

He left Konami in the same year to work for Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture, but has since returned to compose additional music for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-composer-akira-yamaoka-to-tour-uk">The U.S. tour comes a full decade after Yamaoka toured the UK as part of a Silent Hill Live,</a> performing music from the games with a live band. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-and-live-silent-hills-strange-afterlife">You can read my thoughts on the surreal experience when I attended two of the five shows way back in 2015</a>.</p>

            <p>The creator of viral Roblox game Steal A Brainrot is suing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> doppelgänger for allegedly copying its "artwork, objects, design, and game elements".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court">lawsuit</a> filed in California last week and reported by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court">Aftermath</a>, Steal a Brainrot developer Spyder Games is accusing Fortnite's Stealing Brainrots of infringing its copyright after securing the rights to its creation in August.</p>
<p>In its legal paperwork, Spyder claims that since its launch in May 2025, Steal a Brainrot has been played almost six billion times, had a concurrent peak of 20 million players, and is "consistently one of the top three games on Roblox by player count", whereas Stealing Brainrots, created by Thomas Van Der Voort, wasn't uploaded to Fortnite Creative until July 2025.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Brainrot Fighting</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Spyder is calling on the court "to stop defendant's unlawful conduct" and "recover the losses [it has] suffered and will continue to suffer, including any profits defendant has gained from this unlawful infringement".</p>
<p>Spyder is seeking a jury trial, actual damages, punitive damages, attorney fees, and a permanent injunction restraining the Van Der Voort from violating its rights under copyright law.</p>
<p>"The similarities are not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function," the lawsuit adds. "Defendant made conscious decisions to copy the creative choices and unique designs that were implemented in the game. The similarities between the game and the infringing game are not coincidental. They are the result of willful infringement by defendant in an effort to steal the market for plaintiff's game."</p>

<p>A Minecraft Movie is officially launching an awards campaign for consideration for upcoming ceremonies like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is official from Warner Bros. itself.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, A Minecraft Movie brought the blocky world of Minecraft to live-action and the results were rather decent. However, the real success came from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its large box office</a>, which came as a result of successful marketing and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>. Now, there is now a chance we could hear “Steve’s Lava Chicken” sung on the Oscars stage or Jack Black thank ‘Chicken Jockey’ at his Golden Globes acceptance speech.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-campaigning-for-all-major-categories-including-best-picture-and-actor">A Minecraft Movie Campaigning for All Major Categories, Including Best Picture and Actor</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warner Bros. has launched campaigns for many of its films to be considered for end-of-year awards like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. While some films, like the smash-hits Weapons, One Battle After Another, and Sinners, are among the names, one is a bit out-there: <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a>. It’s not out there for movies, even okay ones, to do award campaigns, as it could snag some nominations if it’s lucky. However, Warner Bros. is putting everything up for the film, including it’s main cast and director.</p>



<p>The full list of contested categories can be <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. Notable ones include Best Picture, Jared Hess for Best Director, and Jack Black for Best Actor. Will it get any of those? Seeing how the race is, definitely not. However, personally, it does have a shot at Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. Depending on how some future movies do, you could even put “I Feel Alive” up there for Best Original Song. </p>



<p>While a weird campaign, it’s not surprising for Warner Bros. to do so. As mentioned before, A Minecraft Movie had a meteoric rise at the box office. In fact, it’s currently the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a> behind Lilo &amp; Stitch and Ne Zha 2. A sequel is already greenlit and in production as of earlier this month. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if it leads anywhere and, if it does, it will be quite entertaining for sure.</p>



<p>Do you think A Minecraft Movie could get nominated for an Academy Award? Golden Globes? If so, what category? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo: Campaign Evolved and the Future of Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/halo-campaign-evolved-and-future-of-xbox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-campaign-evolved-and-the-future-of-xbox.1335235/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades, <em>Halo </em>was Xbox's crown jewel. The two were intertwined to the point that you couldn't mention Xbox without also mentioning <em>Halo</em>&nbsp;and vice versa.&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>effectively gave Xbox a fighting chance in the console market after all. By the time&nbsp;<em>Halo 3&nbsp;</em>came out, it was almost impossible to imagine that Xbox would ever part with the game franchise that defined the console multiplayer FPS experience.</p>

<p>Alas, all things must change. With the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">upcoming release of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;on the PlayStation 5 in 2026</a>, Xbox will have officially ceded the exclusivity status of the&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>franchise. Although technically speaking&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>has been on PC for quite a while by now, not to mention a couple of mobile game forays.</p>

<p>In any case, this unprecedented change of events didn't come out of nowhere. Recent happenings at Microsoft, notably the firing of thousands of workers and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase" rel="nofollow">recent Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report" rel="nofollow">suggest that Xbox is simply not making enough money</a>&nbsp;for the bigwigs. Since Xbox can't magically make bestselling games appear overnight, the only remaining move left would be to publish games on every available platform.</p>

<h2><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved |&nbsp;</em>Master Chief, Do You Mind Telling Me What You're Doing On That Console?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-ce-warthog.jpg?itok=7dUh9pCa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-ce-warthog.jpg?itok=a1obI2o5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Warthog looks great and all, but what's going on with those clouds?</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside looking in, this almost feels like an act of desperation. If Xbox leadership felt confident about the direction of the brand, there would be no reason to ever bring&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>to PlayStation. Xbox could port over every single other exclusive to PlayStation under the guise of being player friendly, but the Master Chief is to Xbox as Mario is to Nintendo.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, this is no eulogy for the practice of console exclusivity. At the same time, most people would've probably envisioned the end of console exclusives to be a gradual process where PlayStation and Xbox exchange games on a mutually beneficial basis. Most people would've probably never expected that Xbox would give up all of its exclusives over the span of a single console generation.</p>

<p>While it's too early to say that&nbsp;<em>Halo's&nbsp;</em>appearance on PlayStation is a death knell for Xbox's hardware endeavors, it's also hard to view this as anything other than Xbox looking for a soft exit from the console market. You don't give up your literal console-defining franchise if you don't intend to wave the white flag after all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if everything was going according to plan at Xbox, the main question that every&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fan should have when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>is "Why does this exist?"&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved&nbsp;</em>was already remastered in 2011 and subsequently packaged into the <em>Master Chief Collection</em> in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the idea was to release&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>onto PlayStation to establish an initial fanbase in preparation for a future major&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>title, surely there are other ways to approach this. If you were on PlayStation and diving into&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with no context on why it was so popular, you end up with a third of the original trilogy's story and none of the franchise's signature multiplayer. Would that be enough to create loyal fans of a franchise that would've otherwise had literal decades of media to build upon? Xbox seems to think so.</p>

<h2><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved |&nbsp;</em>In Truth, This is a Time to Rejoice</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-ce-grunt.jpg?itok=baLWEFfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-ce-grunt.jpg?itok=I7ew7tvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The fiercest enemies in all of&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, ready&nbsp;to brutalize a new generation of players</figcaption></figure><p>Frankly, this brings up the question of why <em>Halo 3 </em>wasn't&nbsp;remade instead. A hypothetical&nbsp;<em>Halo 3&nbsp;</em>remake can be sold as a standalone product, possibly even bundled with an updated&nbsp;<em>Master Chief Collection</em>. That way new players on PlayStation will have a better idea of what's going on in the story and existing fans will have an excuse to relive the original trilogy.</p>

<p>If presented alongside<em> Halo 3's </em>story<em>,&nbsp;Halo: Campaign Evolved's&nbsp;</em>new prequel missions featuring Sgt. Johnson&nbsp;would arguably have a greater emotional impact as well.&nbsp;The missions would admittedly have to be shoehorned into&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>, yet it would make sense given Sgt. Johnson's role in the game's<em>&nbsp;</em>narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is that the status of the next main&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game is kind of up in the air. If a successor to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite" rel="nofollow">Halo Infinite</a>&nbsp;</em>was in a presentable state, one would assume that it would've been announced by now.&nbsp;One could conceivably announce the <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> remake, then follow it up with a short teaser of the next main&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> game to the mutual benefit of both games. Of course, if there's nothing to show then there's nothing to show.</p>

<p>Either way, the release of&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>will mark the end of an era for Xbox, but at least it gives a wider audience the chance to experience one of the most influential FPSs in video game history. That alone should be cause for celebration for any&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fan, and if <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved </em>can give the franchise a second wind, hen all the better.</p>

<p>Sure, there was far too much monetisation in the form of multiple different currencies, and the battles lacked a much-needed strategic edge, but for a mobile game you can largely play for free, it scratched an itch that kept me from ripping overpriced real-world packs and connected me with a lot of friends doing the same.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftqlnyi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>I’ve kept up playing since then, obtaining all One- to Four-Diamond cards of each of the 11 sets while also managing to pull each Immersive card. I’ve also reached the Master Ball rank in each ranked season. Yet despite being someone clearly still invested, my opinion on TCG Pocket has flip-flopped around like a Magikarp that can't decide if it wants to reach the water or perish on dry land. Every positive comes with a negative for this Coalossal gacha game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="38d82b098e613"><a title="Dragonite &amp; Babies" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38d82b098e613/dragonite-and-babies.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Lowell Bell / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the last year, every key feature or update developer DeNA implemented to make the collecting and battling experience better has come paired with an attempt to fleece the player base for more real-world dollars.</p>
<p>A good example of this (that later got ‘fixed’) is how you trade. TCG Pocket launched without the ability to do so — despite the name of the game — and when it did debut, it came with another new currency and restrictive rules around what cards you could trade, enticing you to spend more real-world money on packs, as gacha games are wont to do.</p>
<p>Notably, you couldn’t trade cards from the current set, and you couldn’t trade Two-Star cards or above. If your favourite Pokémon is Dragonite and you <em>really</em> want that rainbow-border Dragonite EX, better break out that credit card because the Pack Points system isn’t going to get you there unless you spend a few hundred dollars, as you couldn’t trade a friend with duplicates for it.</p>
<p>After fan backlash, DeNA course-corrected from this restrictive system. They first Axewed the trade-based currency and merged it with Shinedust. And sometime soon — perhaps even as you’re reading this — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">they promise</a> you’ll get to trade Two-Star cards while also implementing the ability to gift Diamond rarity cards to friends.</p>
<p>These changes will undoubtedly make TCG Pocket much more player-friendly, yet from my anecdotal experience, this is too little too late. Many people I know dropped it because it was far too stressful to keep up with the rapid release schedule of new cards.</p>
<p>And despite improvements to trading, I’m not sure collecting is going to get much better. The most recent set — the limited-time Deluxe Pack EX — has players both happy and angry like a Morpeko. There’s no mechanically new cards in this pack; however, every pack has an EX card within. This makes it an absolutely amazing catch-up pack for players who missed key cards in past sets.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4748a5f840705"><a title="Deluxe Pack EX All Pack Mascots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4748a5f840705/deluxe-pack-ex-all-pack-mascots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokemon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, this set is impossible to finish without spending money before it leaves the game, until some time in the nebulous future when DeNA re-releases it. They went ahead and included 353 total cards, which is quadruple a normal pack of about 75 cards. It includes reverse holo cards along with regular reprints of common cards, making most packs full of fluff for those — like me — that have kept up with their collections.</p>
<p>Worse, the cards from this set do not retroactively clear past sets despite being the same in every other way, meaning that if you want to grab those last few EX you’re missing to complete them, this pack is essentially useless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people I know dropped it because it was far too stressful to keep up with the rapid release schedule of new cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While my opinion on the collection aspect of TCG Pocket has soured, I’ve come to appreciate increasing strategic depth to ranked online battles. I know many don’t agree with me here, but as someone who has regularly played online TCGs since <strong>Hearthstone</strong>’s debut, I find a lot of the matches require interesting plays and choices that keep me coming back to reach Master Ball every season. DeNA has done a great job targeting issues with the battle system, such as introducing Baby Pokémon that alleviate the disadvantage of going first if you’re running a deck with them.</p>
<p>However, not everything is perfect as we’re mired in a Suicune EX and Greninja meta at the moment. DeNA does not rebalance their cards, instead choosing to power creep their older sets, which means the last pack mascot — Suicine — is dominating the meta, appearing in about 60% of my matches. Greninja is the only non-Trainer Genetic Apex card that still sees regular play. I was done playing against the blue dog and frog about a week into the September season. Even if the matches against it are often exciting, no new cards from the Deluxe Pack EX unfortunately ensured we got another month of their <em>'rain'</em> of terror.</p>

<p>Of all the people I know still playing TCG Pocket, I’m the only one who consistently climbs the ranked ladder every season. Most people just log in to rip their daily packs, check Wonderpicks, and move on.</p>
<p>Every positive change DeNA makes to TCG Pocket either comes with or is in response to a negative, still. The Mega Evolution-themed set has three packs to open instead of one or two, making it harder to collect ‘em all. But immediate trading of that set means you can grab the meta-relevant cards or cards you want to build decks for quicker, making the climb to the Master Ball rank that much more exciting as more people will have cards to stay competitive with the Wailords among us.</p>
<p>If the upcoming trading features bring a player-friendly breath of fresh air to the game, I could see myself enjoying TCG Pocket for another year or more.</p>
<p>After a full year of updates, I wouldn’t change my review score; however, it'd be a 7/10 for different reasons. Battles are far more strategic now, but the collection aspect can oftentimes feel overwhelming, especially if you’re free-to-play.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6e5f314903a25"><a title="Pokémon TGC Pocket" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e5f314903a25/pokemon-tgc-pocket.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With additions to the trading system on the horizon, TCG Pocket <em>might</em> reach a place where it feels less like it’s a floundering Magikarp and something more like the raging Gyarados it was when it first launched. But as always with mobile gacha games, I don't have a lot of hope that potential will ever materialise.</p>

A glass of wine in the evening at a villa in the Sunset Marquis hotel, West Hollywood. A phone call in the dark outside a Chinese restaurant in Windsor, England.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three disparate scenes, all more than 5,000 miles from Sony's headquarters in Tokyo, were backdrops for a decision that helped define the PlayStation 2, Sony's landmark console that celebrates its 25th anniversary in North America today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best-selling console of all time for well-documented reasons: its massive library, its headstart on the Xbox, its mid-life price cut, and its affordability as a DVD player. But the deal that brought a trio of Grand Theft Auto games – GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas – to the PS2 before any other platform was also vital. They collectively make up three of its top six sellers. Some people bought the PS2 just to play GTA and if you didn't have one, you were nagging a friend who did. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris Deering, the then-president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, estimates the deal boosted console sales in Europe by a fifth – a huge margin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've heard snippets about this deal and about that key meeting at the Sunset Marquis before. But IGN has now spoken to four people at the centre of it all who can tell the story in more detail than ever. They reveal previously unknown twists and turns in negotiations: how Sony nearly missed out on exclusivity in the US, how Take Two got cash and a discount on production costs from Sony, and how Microsoft could've derailed the whole thing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-claude-1761233968809.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Theft Auto 3's silent protagonist, Claude, became one of the PS2's iconic characters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2D, top-down GTA games sold decently but scored middling reviews, and Deering's interest in GTA 3 was only sparked by a chance conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We used to have these company pub nights," he says. "It gave me a chance to deal with people I would never talk to and ask them some dumb questions." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He asked one such dumb question to the "very sharp" Sarah Thompson, who oversaw a Sony team evaluating third-party games. "I said: 'You seen anything?' She said: 'Yeah, GTA is looking really cool.' It put it at the back of my mind."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was actually a contractor called Andy Macoy who had first flagged a GTA 3 test build as impressive. As well as being filed in Deering's brain, it sat on the team's shortlist of games that Sony might want to secure as an exclusive at E3 2000, according to the then-vice president of publisher and developer relations at SCEE, Zeno Colaço, who was Thompson's boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering went to LA that June knowing he needed exclusives in order to win a second console generation in a row. Microsoft’s Xbox was on the horizon and Bill Gates had showed off a prototype in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They get a billion dollars a year from Windows licenses. They can do anything they want – they just have to want," he says. "How do we get out ahead of this? That was in the back of my mind. I didn't want them to come in and take away the chance of getting two console [generations] in a row. It was almost like a personal, I don't want to say vendetta, but it could have rained on my parade. So that was a hidden motivation."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sony needed it more than we did.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering and David Reeves, then head of marketing at SCEE and later Deering's replacement as president, met various publishers at a villa in the Sunset Marquis hotel. Take Two, the owner of Rockstar Games, was on the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every person at that meeting tells a slightly different version of the story. Non-disclosure agreements obscure some of the details and the intervening 25 years have clouded memories. It's not clear what was negotiated in the room and what was handled in follow-up phone calls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we know at least six people attended. From Take Two it was Kelly Sumner, who led the company outside of the USA and would become CEO in 2001, and Gary Lewis, who was COO and later president of international. From Sony it was Deering, Reeves, Colaço, John Brunning from the legal team, and possibly also Jim Ryan, who later led Sony's gaming division. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colaço claims Sumner initiated the meeting "to complain that another one of Take Two's games was getting a knock back from our content group" – the same group that had earmarked GTA 3 as a winner. He thinks that game may have been State of Emergency, which Sony thought was "gratuitously violent".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Anyway, we listened to their complaints," he says. "I explained our position and thoughts of what adjustments might be an acceptable compromise." Then, "to smooth the meeting over and throw them a bone, we asked them whether we could do an exclusivity deal on GTA and another game, with the background knowledge that GTA was doing something original".</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-cat-1761234025399.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The exclusivity deals mean Stephen Bliss' character illustrations for the "3D Universe" era of GTA games feel distinctly linked to the PlayStation brand. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner rejects this version of events. "I'm not saying we were happy about the approval process" for games, he says, but any discussion of that was not linked in "any way at all" to the GTA deal. Exclusivity would never have been used as any kind of "sweetener" for Take Two, he says, because "Sony needed [it] more than we did". (It's also worth pointing out that Deering intended to bring up exclusivity at the meeting anyway, and that Lewis, from Take Two, also says he doesn't recall what Colaço describes).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, the starting point of the offer, Colaço says, was "co-marketing" for GTA 3. Basically, Sony would match $1m of Take Two's marketing money. It offered the same deal for another Rockstar game, but he doesn't recall which one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were at least two other elements to the deal, although they appear to have been negotiated after that initial E3 meeting, likely back in the UK between Deering and Sumner. First, cash up front. Second, what Sumner describes as a "reduction on production costs". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In those days, production costs were really, really expensive," he explains. "Basically for the right to buy a disc and have it packaged and delivered to your warehouse, I think in around 2000 is about $11 per disc… And when you're selling millions and millions of discs, which hopefully we were, any reduction on that is very nice, thank you very much." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He won't say how much of a discount it was, but Deering says it was "in the neighbourhood of a couple of pounds a unit, maybe $3". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 3 sold 8.5 million copies on PS2 – which, at $3 a unit, would represent more than $25m in potential savings for Take Two and Rockstar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Two also negotiated incentives in exchange for, among other things, Sony getting the rights to sell exclusive software bundles that would include GTA, Colaço says. And as for the cash, Sumner recalls Sony agreeing to pay a "significant amount of money" up front – back then, Take Two was not the mega multi-billion dollar company that it is today, and "any millions that were coming in were gratefully received at that stage".</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We were keen to get into bed with Sony.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither side characterises negotiations as tough. "It wasn't like the United Nations, it was more, 'Would you like another glass of wine?'" says Deering. "It wasn't intense."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's very few formal meetings with Chris [Deering]," adds Sumner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It'd be a mistake to think that this deal was <em>purely </em>about money. From speaking to all sides, it's clear that these men got on well, respected each other, and shared a common outlook on gaming's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering wanted more "mature" games on PS2 to make the console more relevant to adults – Rockstar fit the mold. Take Two, for its part, knew the PS2's power could match Rockstar's creative ambitions. It also knew that Rockstar's games were edgy and, at times, controversial, so it needed a company that understood its vision and wouldn't meddle. Sony, which had experience managing stars like Mariah Carey, were ideal, says Take Two's Lewis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we were keen to get into bed, so to speak, with and work alongside Sony. And interestingly enough, they felt the same," he says. "You sit down sometimes, if you're lucky to do so, with certain people in a room and you realize, okay, we're comfortable with this deal… we knew we could work with them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everyone knew what they wanted from it," says Sumner. Sony was "massively supportive… and we just absolutely believed in what they were going to deliver."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-de-1761234429773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 3 remains culturally important to this day, and was remastered for modern consoles in 2021.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner couldn't sign the deal off alone, though: he needed his CEO and, crucially, Rockstar to agree. It felt like a "massive, massive bet" to cut off Xbox and to focus on the PS2 as a platform. "It had to be a team decision… but Sam [Houser] and the guys were like, 'Well, if we want to deliver what we really want to deliver, we can't keep on PS1. And it has to be PS2.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal for GTA 3 to have two years of console exclusivity with PlayStation was finalized with an evening phone call. "I was standing outside a Chinese restaurant in Windsor and doing the final negotiation," Sumner says. "The deal was done at eight or nine o'clock at night, out in the dark, in Windsor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does it look like a fair deal looking back? In a 2013 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article?page=3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Eurogamer</a>, David Reeves described it as "remarkably cheap". Sumner chuckles at the notion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that's in hindsight, either that or he's the best poker player in the world. He certainly squeaked a bit when we did the deal," Sumner says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were very, very happy at the time. And I think Sony were very happy as well. Yes, it was cheap from what we now know… I wish I could go back in time and renegotiate it and get a few more quid," he says, chuckling again. "[But] also, it was more beneficial for Take Two and Rockstar than we thought it was going to be. So everyone won."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering, for his part, says he does not think it was cheap, and that it was broadly in line with other exclusive deals negotiated at the time – including securing Tomb Raider as a PS1 exclusive. The concept of the deal, he says, was to "make up what they would've made by having the other versions".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn't the end of the saga. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There were conversations about doing something with Xbox. But that just didn't seem right.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal only secured exclusivity in Europe: in the US, Sony was "not as massively supportive" of it, Sumner recalls. In fact, GTA 3 could've easily launched in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive in Europe only. That would have, theoretically, allowed it to release on Xbox in the US far earlier than its eventual November 2003 arrival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The US "were ambivalent at first," Deering says. "I don't think they were focusing on the franchise, and hadn't had that same tip from their third party team on the rumoured power of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then word got out around the industry that this is going to be a good game," he says. "And finally, I think at the very last minute, the US came in and joined on. 'Can we hitchhike on this deal?'" He claims they did so "reluctantly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colaço says it may have even been after GTA 3's initial release. Sony Computer Entertainment America "only really got on board when they saw GTA’s sales impact and the relationship we had established with Take Two flourishing," he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Xbox's release approached, Sony and Take Two's partnership was tested again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has previously revealed that, in 2001, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recalls-time-it-rejected-rockstars-pitch-to-put-gta3-on-the-original-xbox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected Rockstar's pitch to put GTA 3 on the console</a>. It's not clear how an alternate version of events would've jived with Sony's exclusivity deal, but Sumner believes that, ultimately, a deal with Microsoft was "never going to happen" even if it was "ridiculously large".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were conversations about doing something with them. But that just didn't, in my mind, my memory, didn't seem right," he says. "They weren't heavy and they weren't aggressive about it, Microsoft, but… we were happy with the bed we're lying in. And there was no reason to change and also, you know, PlayStation were doing better than Microsoft at that stage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also claims Microsoft just "didn't understand what made us tick".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sony made you feel warm and in my memory, that's not what we got with Microsoft. They weren't aloof, but they just really didn't get it. I don't think they really understood the market. And they weren't certainly putting their arms around us. You do business with people you like, or you trust. And that's what we did. We just trusted [Sony], absolutely trusted them."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>He was serenading the whole hotel… And he's not a bad singer, to be fair.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That trust, and those flourishing relationships, glued Take Two and Sony together, says Lewis. "You could ring any of the senior management there and they would answer your call and they would listen to what your concern was, whether it be getting approval for the game, whether it be production and marketing, whatever it is… I was speaking to someone from Sony probably daily."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony also helped on the development side, recalls Obbe Vermeij, who was then a technical director at Rockstar North. GTA 3 famously began development on the Dreamcast, and while he was initially sad to leave it behind, Sony made the switch easy by sending 20 PS2 dev kits, which were rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony didn't lend Rockstar engineers but it did have what Vermeij describes as a "weird room full of electronics" at its London HQ, where third-party developers could test their games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They would be able to find the bottlenecks and tell you, at a very detailed level, these instructions [to fix it]," he explains. "Sony were just super supportive whenever we asked for something, they would give it to us." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering and Sumner's relationship was particularly strong. They only have good things to say about each other, and, Sumner says, still occasionally meet for beers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have very fond memories of Chris Deering singing outside my hotel in Reykjavik at four o'clock in the morning. He was serenading the whole hotel… And he's not a bad singer, to be fair." But those trips – those "jollies" – weren't nearly as important as the support Sony provided. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They really went out there to support the company...  and I hate to say, in my opinion, unlike Nintendo, unlike Xbox, and unlike Sega," he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It felt like someone putting their arm around you and saying, actually, guys, you're part of the team. I mean, it sounds like I'm in the Sony fan club. And I'm not saying that just because it's about PlayStation 2, I actually truly believe it."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/vice-city-cast-1761234168103.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The success of the GTA 3 deal led to Vice City's 12-month PlayStation 2 exclusivity.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That trust lasted far beyond GTA 3. It's not clear when timed exclusivity discussions for GTA Vice City and San Andreas began. Deering remembers the initial agreement as a "three-game deal." Sumner says each of the games was negotiated separately. Colaço says it was when SCEA joined the GTA 3 exclusivity deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was, at the very least, a renegotiation of terms following GTA 3's release, Colaço says. "Once the game came out and was a success, much bigger than anyone expected, then to maintain the arrangement the financial numbers went up considerably." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Two, he says, made the argument that losing out on sales on other platforms was becoming more and more costly as GTA's popularity surged. He says that was "partially true", but that Take Two also enjoyed being a close partner with Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So the conversations became much more about becoming strategic partners than transactional ones." That includes, he says, discussions about exclusivity for future GTA games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we don't know the terms of the Vice City or San Andreas deals, it's safe to say they were far bigger than GTA 3's. And, as we know, the exclusivity periods shrunk with each new game. Sony secured a full year for Vice City, but just seven months for San Andreas – both down from GTA 3’s two years. As time went on, the people attending meetings "changed a little as discussions were more global and the financial numbers dwarfed the original deal," Colaço says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sam Houser and others were all like, 'Oh my God, it's not doing well.'</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The impact of GTA 3 on wider gaming culture and on the PS2's sales was not immediate, nor guaranteed. Before release, Rockstar was worried that GTA 3 wouldn't cut through, Vermeij says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the last E3 show before [release], maybe six or eight months before the game came out, it had a really poor showing. People weren't really that interested. I remember the guys in New York, Sam Houser and others, they were all like, 'Oh my God, it's not doing well.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But of course, we did know that Sony were into it, and they promised a lot of marketing and they totally delivered on that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until six months after release that its success was obvious, he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Typically a game would sell well for three or four months and then it would just die out. With GTA 3, it wasn't like that. It sold okay, but then it just didn't die out. It just kept going because people told their friends and it was just picked up organically. It just kept going."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner and Lewis both say Take Two played into that by keeping the product "tight": if demand was one million units, they'd ship 600,000. "People were saying it was going to be banned. It was never ever going to be banned, but people believed that, and so what we did is we kept the product really, really tight, so when you saw it in Electronics Boutique, you had to buy it, because if you didn't buy it they may not be here tomorrow,” Sumner says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto was soon a phenomenon with cultural cache. Sumner, who had moved to New York, was called onto primetime TV shows to defend GTA's violence. He also recalls putting a music budget together of $600,000, only for Tommy Matola, the head of Sony Music Entertainment, to say he'd do it for free. "He said, 'I will get you the tracks, I just want to release the CD.' That was the power of Grand Theft Auto."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lewis recalls the joy of success following GTA 3's release. "You get a sigh of relief, I think is fair to say initially, and then this euphoria, because it keeps happening. We really had arrived when these products continued day in, day out, to sell… every 100,000 new PS2s we could pretty much say, 'Well, we got to sell another 10,000 GTA 3s.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's impossible to say exactly how much GTA exclusivity contributed to the PS2's success, but everyone agrees it helped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course they would have been successful [without it],"  Sumner says. "Would they have been as successful without Grand Theft Auto? Probably not, because the amount of coverage and the desirability of that product just sucked people in at a ridiculous rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sony delivered a great platform but it's a piece of plastic unless you have something like Grand Theft Auto on it and that was fundamental to people's understanding or awakening to the opportunities, cultural opportunities that the PlayStation could deliver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering adds that, in Europe, "all things considered, recognising and trying to be self critical and not inflating everything, we probably did 20% more than we would've without it, at least through PS2 and 3."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not bad for what started as evening drinks at a Los Angeles hotel. "They came to the Sunset to complain," says Colaço. "They went out with $2m they weren't expecting. And we did the best exclusivity deal of all time!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Samuel Horti is a journalist with bylines at the BBC, IGN, Insider Business, and Edge. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-sony-secured-gta-as-a-ps2-exclusive]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publisher Krafton has declared itself an "AI-first company", announcing a move to "place AI at the centre of problem solving" via a "complete" company reorganisation.</p>
<p>The megacorp outlined its "transition to an AI-first company" in a Korean-language <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">statement</a> posted to the official website that detailed the goals of its new strategy to "prioritise AI as a central and primary means of problem-solving", "fostering change in individuals and organisations, increasing company-wide productivity, and accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth".</p>
<p>"Starting today, Krafton will automate work centered on Agentic AI and fully implement an AI-centered management system where members focus on creative activities and complex problem solving," said Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han, as translated by machine. "We will leap forward as a company that promotes the growth of members and expands the organisation's areas of challenge through AI."</p>
<p>As part of this commitment, Krafton's earmarked around $69.7 million (100 billion Korean won / £52.3 million) to invest in a GPU cluster, and support the multi-stage tasks required for "sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning". This, Krafton believes, will serve as a foundation for accelerating its AI tech, which it hopes to complete and have up and running in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>Another $20.8 million (30 million Korean won / £15.5m) will also be invested in its workforce to train its staff to use AI tools.</p>
<p>It'll be through this new infrastructure that Krafton believes it will strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services.</p>
<p>Krafton's position is not an outlier in the industry. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars, Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> has used AI tool Stable Diffusion, and even <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> has admitted experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Sharp Dressed Man,” by ZZ Top. Hard on a good day, Medium when my friends were over, Expert once and then never ever again. That was my <em>Guitar Hero</em> sweet spot. And for years, it seemed like everybody had one. The plastic guitar controllers became a staple of living rooms everywhere, and the songs — from big bands, small bands, and bands that didn’t even actually exist — became huge hits. Long before TikTok was the most important thing in music, getting your track on a <em>Guitar Hero</em> setlist could change your life forever.</p><p>For <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/versionhistory">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a><em>, </em>we go through the whole history of <em>Guitar Hero. </em>The story begins in arcades in Japan, travels to an unlikely pair of companies in the US, and nearly falls apart entirely before becoming an enormous hit. For a few years, <em>Guitar Hero </em>was as big as any game you could find, before it began to slowly fade into the background. The game may not be around anymore, but you can still find its legacy in some pretty big-name videogames.</p><p>Hosts David Pierce, Ash Parrish, and Chris Grant all lived through various parts of the <em>Guitar Hero </em>story. They gather at the <em>Version History</em> roundtable to talk about the franchise’s many precursors and influences, the E3 conference that became the franchise’s breakout hit, the eventual rise of Rock Band, and how <em>Guitar Hero </em>eventually lost most of its luster. We also bust out the axe for the first time in a long time, to see who’s still got it.</p><p>This is the fourth episode of <em>Version History. </em>(The first three were about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/792339/version-history-podcast-hoverboards">hoverboards</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/798692/how-blackberry-messenger-set-texting-free">BBM</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/802307/sony-watchman-tv-version-history">Sony Watchman</a>).

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>The PlayStation 2 is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, October 26, 2025. Below, we remember the diversity of its library, the qualities that have lived on beyond it, and the ones that were exclusive to that moment in time.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In a certain light, games are more expansive than they have ever been. Forums like Itch proliferate game jams and niche sub-cultures, and give aspiring developers a place to share their work. Steam is home to a wider catalogue of games than has ever been available on any home console. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">The diversity of the games in these places is under direct threat</a>, but is by no means defeated.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, if one wanted to experience the medium of video games in all its breadth on just one platform, a PlayStation 2 might still be the best bet.</p><p dir="ltr">The diversity of the PS2 forms a striking contrast with its counterparts released during the same period. The Nintendo GameCube has more than a few bonafide classics, but the majority of them were developed in-house. You will always know Microsoft's original Xbox better as the source of Halo-fueled college LAN parties and Xbox Live hangouts for any other game you could play with it.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2, on the other hand, is host to a set of video games that stretch beyond their borders and feel, somehow, barely associated with the console that first housed them. It carried Grand Theft Auto to becoming the biggest video game franchise on the planet. The console is tightly tied to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in my mind, even though those games also came out on the GameCube and Xbox. It was the origin point of Kingdom Hearts. It kickstarted Persona's explosion of popularity in the US and Europe, paving the way for Metaphor: ReFantazio. It is hard to understate the PS2's role in popularizing the medium of games and setting the course for what it would become.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590777-61pete6v4vl._ac_uf1000%2C1000_ql80_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590777" data-ratio="0.656" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590777-61pete6v4vl._ac_uf1000%2C1000_ql80_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590777"></a><figcaption>The humble, classic PlayStation 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590777-61pete6v4vl._ac_uf1000%2C1000_ql80_.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It also was host to the unusual and unique. Rule of Rose is still one of the strangest and most profound survival horror games ever, and stands up strong against the competition of the time, which includes unassailable classics like Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4. It was home to Drakengard, a still disturbing and grueling journey through dark fantasy hell. Ico and Shadow of the Colossus are still stealthily influential, shaping The Last of Us and God of War (2018) alike. Yet, they have a grandeur and a magic those games cannot capture, a poetic spareness that feels tied to the PS2's architecture. If you play Shadow of the Colossus on an original PS2, you can feel the console straining against the ambition on display. That fact enhances its majesty, it does not strangle it.</p><p dir="ltr">On the PS2, Katamari Damancy--a gonzo, existential toy--could find a massive audience, while Silent Hill 2 and Fatal Frame III: The Tormented pushed the medium towards a maturity it still struggles to find. Games like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty questioned the foundations of the medium well before BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line tried their hands at metafiction. Of course, the PS2 was a product of all that had come before. Still, the breadth of what it sets up and anticipates is astounding.</p><p dir="ltr">All this, though, takes for granted the distance I have now from this time period. I am not reading about interesting games from Japan that will never be ported over. I am not strolling down to my local store, only to find the shelves populated with cheap tie-in games and money-grubbing sports titles. I am not an aspiring game developer, attempting to make my way into the industry and discovering how hard it is to make something that is truly yours. I am someone who has played most PS2 games by borrowing them from friends, picking them up on the cheap from a mom-and-pop game store, or through extralegal means. I can now play English translations of those games that never made it to America. My wistful utopian gaze at the PS2 is a side-effect of revisiting it now. Plenty of my grips with the video game industry have their roots on the PS2. As I am typing this, unique and startling visions are just a click away. Why feel nostalgic at all?</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">The PS2 was far from the last time video games were good. But it was the last time mainstream games felt like they were actively and collectively pushing new ground beyond pixel counts.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">One reason is that the PS2 represents a time when few console games were aspiring to take over your life. The lack of ubiquitous internet connections on consoles meant that only a scant few could offer continual online updates. Massive online sagas like Final Fantasy XI and Phantasy Star Online were exceptions that proved the rule. Even they did not have the innumerable hooks into your wallet and your life that are commonplace across free-to-play online games now. The roots of that are, of course, in PC gaming. But now it is everywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 also got way cheaper over its lifecycle. For a time, the PS2 was cheap enough it became ubiquitous. It is still the best-selling console of all time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/04/playstation-2-manufacture-ends-years?INTCMP=SRCH" rel="nofollow ">still selling over a million units</a> in the fourth quarter of 2012, just a few months before it was discontinued, at the very end of its life. For years after, games like FIFA and Final Fantasy XI were still regularly launching new entries on the PS2. It is <a href="https://www.theenemy.com.br/playstation/playstation-2-terceiro-mais-popular-brasil" rel="nofollow ">still one of the most popular consoles in Brazil</a>, when modded models running pirated games reign supreme. That fact makes Sony's pivot into expensive, premium hardware with the PlayStation 3 all the more baffling and heartbreaking.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, the PS2 was a device that was relatively cheap, had a gigantic and diverse library, and existed on the cusp of a new online era it both predicted and eluded. The PS2 was far from the last time video games were good. But it was the last time mainstream games felt like they were actively and collectively pushing new ground beyond pixel counts. For much of the PS2's lifecycle, even mainstream games felt expansive, strange, and daring. That's worth celebrating, and worth mourning.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The United Kingdom’s relationship with the video game expo scene has crumbled. Once upon a time, the nation boasted showcases like the Insomnia Gaming Festival, WASD, and EGX, but they’ve all disappeared into the shadows over the years.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival went bust (and is trying a half-hearted resurgence), WASD shut down, and EGX has become a pitiful, almost unbranded corner in the larger MCM Comic Con in London. I attended EGX over the weekend, and I’m sad to say that it’s no longer worth keeping alive.</p>



<p>EGX’s disappearance marks the death of the UK gaming expo circuit.</p>



<h2 id="h-uk-gamers-are-left-to-dream-hack">UK Gamers Are Left to Dream(Hack)</h2>



<p>Next year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">DreamHack returns</a> to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>ten years</strong>, which is a saving grace of sorts for gamers across the territory. In some places, the courageous efforts of more grassroots events like EPIC.LAN are trying to get some wheels turning, but the most iconic expos in the business have now faded into nothingness.</p>



<p>In 2024, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomnia-gaming-festival-review/">Insomnia Gaming Festival</a> imploded after 25 years of entertaining visitors, thanks to financial woes brought on by the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s trying to make a grand return in 2025, but <strong>it’s not looking good</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>One of the final Insomnia Gaming Festival events, and while it was bustling, nobody knew it was about to collapse.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Also in 2024, the WASD showcase, a more intimate event in London that was one of my favorite events in the world, was shut down as the event’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-scene-crumble-wasd/">organiser entered liquidation</a>.</p>



<p>Now, I’m sad to report that EGX is done and dusted.</p>



<h2 id="h-farewell-egx">Farewell, EGX</h2>



<p>Formerly known as the Eurogamer Expo, EGX was once the shining star of the UK gaming scene, a monumental event that drew international acclaim and hosted a showfloor featuring the biggest names in the business.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This was EGX in 2014 after a rebrand from ‘Eurogamer Expo’. It was a massive event that was once seen as the UK’s E3.</figcaption></figure>







<p>The COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t kind to EGX, but in the years that followed the devastation of the virus, EGX seemed to be getting back on an even keel. That growth has ebbed away into nothing, and EGX is now an unrecognizable corner of the larger MCM Comic Con event.</p>



<p>I attended EGX (for the last time) this year, and baulked at what was on display. It was almost impossible to spot any EGX branding, and what I did find was a few scattered indie games and a lone LAN area featuring a few rigs with a mix of playable titles on them. No big names, no exclusive demo opportunities, and almost <strong>nothing </strong>in the way of gaming activations.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The cracks in EGX started showing in 2023 (Image Credit: Later Levels Blog)</figcaption></figure>







<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">EGX and MCM joined forces</a>, but the showcases were separated, and EGX still enjoyed a standalone profile that was represented in the branding of the event. This year, EGX has all but disappeared, leaving MCM standing tall – but even that has issues.</p>



<p>As I walked around MCM, I was greeted by vast swathes of market-style stalls selling anime body pillow covers, mystery bags, animatronic furry tails, AI-generated art prints, and plastic toys aplenty. Amid a sea of half-baked cosplays and bored-looking event employees, I found none of my people; the gamers had failed to show out for EGX, what little of it there was.</p>



<h2 id="h-barely-an-expo">Barely an Expo</h2>



<p>The PR folks backing the event were offering me nothing but film and TV opportunities, and despite there being the likes of Troy Baker, Ben Starr, Chris Judge, Doug Cockle, Neil Newbon, and Elias Toufexis in attendance, nothing came up in a gaming capacity.</p>



<p>I made a conscious effort to request <strong>some kind of connection </strong>from the staff running the meet and greet area, and was palmed off with a ‘Sorry, they don’t have time for that,’ by a go-between messenger of an employee who failed to get me any traction from a nearby manager. I should stress that the manager who had ‘no time’ for me was plainly standing on the spot doing nothing.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know you’re in the good times <strong>when you’re in them</strong>. This was one of the first Eurogamer Expos in London</figcaption></figure>







<p>With no games to play, no big-named exhibitors occupying the show floor, and there being nothing in the way of gaming activations, I was reduced to wandering the stalls and trying to get excited about merchandise (spoiler alert: <strong>I didn’t</strong>).</p>



<p>The panels were visited by a half dozen people every time someone was on the stage, the security staff were lacklustre and weren’t doing their job properly, and the busiest portion of the event seemed to always be the ‘food court’.</p>



<p>I can see EGX vanishing entirely next year, and while MCM will persist, it too has been reduced to something almost unworthy of a spot in your calendar. All eyes are now on Gamescom, an utterly phenomenal event that continues to expand year after year. I’ve been to Gamescom twice and can stress that it’s the <strong>ultimate event </strong>in the world for gamers, and I just praise that it’s only a short flight away for me.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, gamers around the world can still enjoy events like Summer Game Fest, PAX, DreamHack, Tokyo Game Show, and other localized, regional events. If you want a regular expo in the UK, you’re out of luck and will need to travel.</p>



<p>Do you agree that the United Kingdom needs to do better in the gaming space? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>This week, we're back with the <strong>Metroid</strong> franchise with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>, the excellent GameCube follow-up to the Retro Studios original. Released in 2004, it introduced the now-iconic Dark Samus to the series while showcasing an awesome dual-world environment in which a deadly species known as the 'Ing' attack Samus and rob her of her core abilities.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Overall reception was positive, with many praising its continued gameplay and intriguing storyline, though some criticism was made toward the game's high difficulty and limited multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Its the west vs. Japan this week, so let's get to it!</p>

<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="727ea50c27067"><a title="Prime Echoes - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/727ea50c27067/prime-echoes-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're all familiar with this one, right? It showcases Samus in a pretty cool action pose, while in the top left, we can see U-Mos, the last remaining Luminoth on the planet Aether. In the bottom right, meanwhile, we can just about make out the Ing, and this makes for a lovely little representation of the light and dark shifts we see in the game. Lovely stuff.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="df0b1e0b514c2"><a title="Prime Echoes - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df0b1e0b514c2/prime-echoes-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/6139-metroid-prime-2-echoes">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach is interesting, not least because it contains an odd little release date advertisement over on the right. Why..? Who knows. Otherwise, this is mostly a showcase of Samus herself, however the change in colours as we move toward the right indicate the encroaching presence of Dark Samus.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's also called 'Dark Echoes' here, for reasons!</p>

<p>Give Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken a new look</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>McDonald's Japan recently teamed up with Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> series to offer a new range of burgers.</p>
<p>If you're not able to make it to Japan in time to taste test each one, this might be the next best thing. The global fast food restaurant is now offering free codes for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> which unlock "McDonald's EX" colours for certain characters. This includes different colours for select Ryu, Chun-Li and Ken outfits.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c5375a50981e"><a title="McDonalds Street Fighter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c5375a50981e/mcdonalds-street-fighter.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom, McDonald's</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's each code via the McDonald's Japan social media account. To unlock each colour in the game, you'll need to navigate to the options menu and scroll down to "Input event code". From there, you can redeem each outfit colour.</p>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ryu)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>M3L4-WJAK-8FCH-6AYV</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Chun-Li)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>CDU9-BBPC-DNQU-98M9</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>McDonald's EX Colour (Ken)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>LFCU-8RYT-7MP9-RH8F</li>
</ul>
<p>Nintendo Life can confirm these codes can be redeemed in local copies of Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2. You can redeem these codes on other platforms as well. Just keep in mind, to access these colours, you'll need to have unlocked or purchased the specific outfit for each character.</p>
<p>These codes can be redeemed until <strong>12th December 2025</strong>. There's also a McDonald's EX colour for M.Bison, but this is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1ogaq3r/comment/nlfd6qe/">apparently a gift</a> region-locked to Japan.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 arrived alongside the Switch 2 in June. You can find out more about it in our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft and Halo Studios have just announced Halo: Campaign Evolved, an Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2001 original-Xbox launch-day classic, Halo: Combat Evolved. I played a short demo of it already, so be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one">my first impressions</a>, but here we’ll go through everything we do and don’t yet know about 2026’s Halo release – which will be the first one since 2021’s Halo Infinite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you say “remake”?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I asked Halo Studios point-blank if this is a remake or a remaster, and Executive Producer Damon Conn said, “It’s a modernized remake – a rebuilt version of the classic story that started it all.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Since Microsoft has been publishing a lot of games on other platforms, does this mean Halo will be coming to PlayStation 5?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PS5. And yes, I did clarify with Halo Studios that the PS5 version will be released day-and-date with the Xbox and PC versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is this weirder than Sonic games coming to Nintendo consoles?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s at least on that same level of weird, yeah.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is Halo Studios adding any PS5 Pro enhancements?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked this question, and Game Director Greg Hermann didn’t say much, only telling me, “It’s safe to say that it will be tuned for the target devices.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>OK, so when will Halo: Campaign Evolved be released?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, all Halo Studios will say is “2026,” but it seems highly likely that it will be released close to the 25th anniversary of Combat Evolved’s release, which will be on November 16, 2026. In other words, Fall 2026 seems like a safe bet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Campaign Evolved? Does that mean there’s no multiplayer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sort of. There is campaign co-op for two players in split-screen, or up to four players online. Cross-play is supported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wait, cross-play? Does that mean I can play co-op with a friend who’s on PS5 while I’m on Xbox or PC?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yup.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Finish the multiplayer thought. What do you mean by “sort of” with multiplayer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name suggests, this is campaign-only. When I asked about why they’re not also remaking Halo 1’s fantastic multiplayer in Unreal Engine 5 – think about how glorious Blood Gulch and Hang ‘Em High and Sidewinder would look in UE5! – Game Director Greg Hermann told me, “Right now we’re just focused on the 25th anniversary and the campaign here.” Executive Producer Damon Conn added, “Halo Infinite and [Halo: The Master Chief Collection] provide really great experiences for multiplayer.” Which is true…though that doesn’t help PS5 owners very much. Unless… </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does this pave the way for Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite to get ported to PS5 to get PlayStation players caught up on the series?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to check back on that one. Conn said, “There is an opportunity for us to grow the fanbase. We’re bringing the most players to Halo ever. So that growth is what we’re truly interested in. And this paves the way for future stories and Halos.” So…maybe?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Will Campaign Evolved be a full-price game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked but didn’t get an answer. Personally, $50 feels right to me without proper multiplayer, but Microsoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><u>already tried</u></a> to raise its first-party game prices to $80 this year, so I’m probably being naively optimistic with that $50 thought. At least there’s new single-player content here, though.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-03-1761260005068.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you just say “new single-player content”?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes! I didn’t get any details beyond the very basic description: Campaign Evolved will include a three-mission prequel story arc revolving around Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. I asked if those missions will be available straight out of the box or if they’ll need to be unlocked, perhaps by completing the campaign. Halo Studios did not have an answer for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any gameplay changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, lots of little ones, actually. Vehicles are now destructible and they can be hijacked, as they were in every subsequent Halo game after Combat Evolved. You can also now pick up and wield any weapon the enemies can, which means you’ll have access to the Energy Sword, among others, in this campaign. The Warthog has four seats now (the extra one is on the back, like riding on the lowered tailgate of a pickup truck), and you can pilot a Wraith tank. I didn’t get to see any of the Flood in the chunk of The Silent Cartographer mission I played, but Halo Studios says they’ve implemented dismemberment for Flood enemies. The team also told me that “level design has been thoughtfully updated” to smooth out pain points. Presumably they meant the Library, but they didn’t specify. Also, the cinematics have all been completely redone, with new mocap and freshly rerecorded dialogue from Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-04-1761260005069.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Any other updates?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other notable one: Skulls! Halo Studios is adding Skulls to Campaign Evolved, and lots of ‘em. The most Skulls ever in a Halo campaign, apparently, and the total number is “dozens.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does it still feel like Halo in Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my brief experience so far, I’d say yes. See my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one">preview</a> for more about that. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Halo: Complete Playlist</h3><p>Halo: Combat Evolved arrived on the scene in 2001.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite x South Park Collab Coming Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-collab-coming-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-x-south-park-collab-coming-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1335118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed that a Fortnite collaboration is coming with <strong>South Park</strong>, the animated show that has been running since the late 1990s. On social media, a claim emerged alongside a source, with the uploader suggesting that someone <strong>at Paramount </strong>corroborated the leak.</p>



<p>Fans quickly busied themselves imagining how it would work, given that South Park characters are fairly diminutive in stature and stand all of about a few feet tall.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-south-park-coming-to-fortnite">Is South Park Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://xcancel.com/SamLeakss/status/1982196155606786464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SamLeakss claimed</a> that South Park is coming to Fortnite in a crossover event.</p>



<p>Far from being the most unlikely thing in the world, players have accepted that this is gospel and have started assembling theories to explain how the collab would work. One user quickly shared an outfit that <strong>might just work</strong>:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others suggested that Epic Games would be throwing Cartman into a Mech Suit, while others demanded the arrival of Mr. Hanky as a Back Bling item. Those familiar with the South Park universe pointed out that ‘anime versions’ of the characters could be used, but that’s perhaps a little too niche to be a commercial success.</p>



<p>We know nothing beyond the original claim, unfortunately.</p>



<p>In recent Fortnite news, it was revealed that the developers of the Roblox game ‘Steal a Brainrot’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steal-a-brainrot-developers-sue-fortnite-copycat/">are trying to sue</a> Fortnite UGC developers who have allegedly ripped off their creation. This is being taken pretty seriously, as Steal a Brainrot has become one of the most popular Roblox games in record time in recent months.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>The Simpsons </strong>are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/">coming to Fortnite</a> with a themed map.</p>



<p>Do you want to see any particular South Park characters surface in this collaboration with Fortnite? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
