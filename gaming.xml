<p>Hall effect sticks? Check</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PowerA has launched a new wireless controller for the Switch 2 (with compatibility confirmed for the OG, Lite, and OLED too), boasting features that could give the official Pro Controller a run for its money.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£54.99 / $69.99</strong>, the Advantage Wireless Controller will come in three flavours: Black, Mario &amp; Friends, and Pokémon: Mega Evolutions. It comes with Hall Effect analogue sticks, motion controls, a dedicated C button, mappable back buttons, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, being a third-party pad, you're not going to get <em>everything</em>, so NFC amiibo support isn't here, and it doesn't seem like these controllers will have wake-up support for the Switch 2 either. Still, at £20 less than the $89.99 asking price for the Pro Controller, the monetary saving could potentially make up for these exclusions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>• Hall Effect Modules:</strong> Contact-free magnetic sensors in the thumbsticks provide a more fluid pro-level feel and help with precision and longevity<strong><br>
• Advanced Gaming Buttons:</strong> Get an edge over the competition with mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons you can program on the fly, mid-game—no system settings to configure<strong><br>
• Intuitive Motion Controls:</strong> Get immersed in your games with fluid, responsive motion controls that provide an intuitive way to aim, steer, fly, and more<strong><br>
• C Button:</strong> Easily activate fun GameChat features<strong><br>
• Rechargeable Battery:</strong> Get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Includes an extra-long 10 ft. USB-C cable to recharge the internal battery*<strong><br>
• Ergonomic Design:</strong> Game for hours with a controller that feels great in your hands, thanks to cutting-edge ergonomics and top-of-the-line materials<strong><br>
• Nintendo Family Compatibility:</strong> Works with the Nintendo Switch system of devices: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and Nintendo Switch Lite<strong><br>
• Officially Licensed:</strong> PowerA products have gone through Nintendo’s rigorous testing and evaluation processes to ensure compatibility with the Nintendo Switch 2 system</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-zero-parades-studio-zaum-workers-alliance-union-uk-branch-iwgb/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-and-zero-parades-developers-za-um-form-workers-alliance-union-at-uk-branch.1314796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, the same team of developers now working on an espionage RPG in a similar vein to Disco Elysium, titled Zero Parades: For Dead Spies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/">which Wccftech recently previewed</a>), have formed a union at ZA/UM's UK branch called the Workers Alliance, represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).</p>



<p>The news was announced with a blog post on the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/">IWGB Game Workers website</a> and in an interview with ZA/UM developers on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. According to the IWGB, the Workers Alliance at ZA/UM UK is "<em>the UK's first recognized games industry union</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>I think the workers at ZA/UM all agree that we have something unique at the studio that we want to preserve for years to come</em>," Poppy Ingham, marketing manager at ZA/UM in the UK, told GI.Biz. UI/UX designer Declan Keane added "<em>The more I've worked here, the more I've realized that what we have is a unique makeup of people, and the union is a large effort to solidify that</em>. <em>Instead of thinking about what the next year will look like, we'll be working together, taking what we've learned already and doubling down on that. I want to play the games that this team makes</em>."</p>



<p>Following the release of Disco Elysium in 2019, a string of controversies followed ZA/UM, with the core creatives on Disco very publicly leaving the studio and claiming to have been ousted by ZA/UM's executive branch, with game director and writer on Disco, Robert Kurvitz, writing an open letter to players claiming the studio had been stolen from him and the rest of the studio's creatives in 2022. </p>



<p>Kurvitz also accused the studio's chief executive officer, Ilmar Kompus, of fraud. Kompus fired back with accusations against Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov that they created a toxic working environment at ZA/UM. Lawsuits were filed shortly after and are still ongoing to this day.</p>



<p>What followed in the wake were two extended documentaries from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames">People Make Games</a> that attempted to break down what happened at ZA/UM, three project cancellations, including a sequel to Disco being cancelled and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">expansion for the original game that resulted in layoffs last year</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/">founding of multiple studios</a> each started by various members of the key creative team behind the original Disco.</p>



<p>Now, the remaining workers at ZA/UM, many of whom did work on the original Disco, but none of whom were the original key writers on the project, are hoping to ensure that ZA/UM remains a good place to work. While many former developers have had less-than-positive things to say about the studio and its conditions, Ingham and other members of the studio's union look to this formation as a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>"<em>The hope for the future</em> of <em>ZA/UM is just to continue what we're doing, but in a very secure and comfortable position now that we have a union established, and to really challenge the studio and the studio's management in the best way possible, to make sure that we're putting ZA/UM out there as the best place to work in the industry - we take care of our staff, we have a union to push the things we require, and we can preserve the talent that we have here</em>."</p>

              <p>In the wake of the phenomenal success of <em>Balatro</em>, we are going to be treated to all manner of gambling-adjacent roguelites. And bring them on, I say! Coming soon we have picture-pairs deckbuilder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509430/Replicat/"><em>Replicat</em></a>, another cat-themed game in Mahjong-based roguelite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3332060/Feng_Shui_Meowjong/"><em>Feng Shui: Meowjong</em></a>, and deckbuilding-meets-slot-machine-meets-rune-matching game&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073990/Runeborn/"><em>Runeborn</em></a> (which is out next week). One of the first to reach us, however, is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/?curator_clanid=38011635"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, a slot-machine-themed game that takes the inherent sadness of plunging all your money into a cold, indifferent machine to a grim, deadly place. And it’s very tough to stop playing.</p> <p>There’s something fundamentally sad about a slot machine. First and foremost, because they’re the grimmest form of gambling: there’s no skill involved at all because every single machine is&nbsp;<em>fixed</em>, paying out when its programming tells it to, and designed to always take in far more than it ever gives. There’s also something unpleasantly ironic about their bright, cheerful presentation, colorful fruits and gems spinning around as a hundred colored lights flash on and off in enticing patterns, all designed to take your money. It’s within this contradiction that <em>CloverPit</em> makes its home, presenting its rotating fruits and treasures on a dilapidated machine, complete with a very concerning blood stain on one corner, and put inside a small, grimy cell-like room. Oh, and if you don’t win enough money, you die.</p>

 <p>There’s a demonic nature to all the proceedings, the game’s dirty pixel graphics reminiscent of 2021’s horror card game <em>Inscryption</em> (one of a number of games with which it can be bought in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58319/CloverPit_x_Inscryption/">a two-game bundle</a>), and a subtitled narrator mockingly explaining your predicament. You need to make a fixed number of coins within three rounds of playing on the slot machine, and if you fall short the floor opens up beneath you and you fall to your death. Should you succeed, the target goes up for what it calls a new Deadline, and three more rounds begin.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631035"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631035">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course there’s a lot more to it than that. Through playing you not only win coins, but also tickets, and these can be used to buy “lucky charms” from a small cabinet behind you. The randomly selected items (chosen from an ever-growing number that are unlocked through reaching certain milestones as you play, one of which involves going for a shit in the room’s filthy toilet) add detailed bonuses, like giving more value to certain symbols or causing other symbols to appear more often, or perhaps randomly triggering the chance for an extra spin in a round. The more you play, the more complicated these bonuses can be, like Fortune Teller’s “25% chance for the chain modifier to be applied to any symbol, decreased by 5% at the end of every round,” where chain modifiers improve the value of particular patterns formed by matching symbols on the three-by-five slot machine display…Like I said, it gets complicated.</p>

 <p>Another crucial element is that for each round, you can choose to play three spins and receive two tickets at the end, or play seven spins and get only one ticket. That imbalance is perfect, forcing you to significantly sacrifice winnings to unlock a more expensive Charm, or risk not getting more bonuses and just going to spins. On top of this, between each Deadline a dirty, red phone will ring, <em>Deal or No Deal</em>-style, and you’re offered the choice of one of three buffs or debuffs. Oh, and there are drawers you can unlock, and there’s a little computer that stores data on all the Charms you’ve unlocked, and the requirements for those you’ve not. It’s an impressive amount to pack into one tiny little prison.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631034">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>‘s greatest advantage is that, just like in real life, those one-armed bandits are compelling machines. There’s a reason we have the cliche of the tragic, hunched figure, feeding coin after coin into the Las Vegas slot machine at 3 a.m. Just pulling the virtual arm in the game and seeing the symbols spin around is enticing. And like real fruit machines, the results are very fixed. Your “luck” is a measurable metric in the game, boosted by Charms, increasing the likelihood of high-scoring patterns of cherries and lemons appearing. This, as it happens, is also the game’s greatest weakness.</p>

 <p>The comparisons with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> are very much invited when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58846/CloverPit__Balatro/">the game can be bought bundled with it</a>. But while&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>‘s poker-themed rogue-ish ways certainly involve a great deal of luck, there’s also an enormous amount of skill involved in shaping a good run from the elements thrown at you. This definitely feels less the case in <em>CloverPit</em> in which, despite the intricacies of the available Lucky Charms and the enormous bonuses available should you wisely combine the attributes of those which work well together, it still always feels far too much like your chance of completing a Deadline can come down to whether the game decides to throw a super-successful spin your way. While you <em>can&nbsp;</em>improve your luck, you can’t purposefully bring on a “jackpot” where every single symbol matches, and you’re pretty certain to earn enough cash.</p>

 <p>It’s also the case that the Charms don’t add anywhere near as much variety to a run as the dozens of different ways you can approach a run at <em>Balatro</em>. This game lacks that sense of, “Oh, I reckon this should be a three-of-a-kind run,” based on your early jokers and planet cards. Instead, you just sort of play the best of what you get, and hope it works out. When it doesn’t, you die and start over.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631036">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The important thing is that starting over remains very compelling. It’s a fast game, nippily speeding through its various elements, meaning you’re never left frustrated by a bad predicament. And of course, the more you play, the more becomes revealed, like what those drawers are for and why, when you put a Charm inside one in one run, it’s replaced by a severed piece of a corpse in the next. Yeah, that’s a thing.</p> <p>That creepiness adds a lot to&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>, with the overriding questions of why exactly you’re being tortured in a disgusting pit with a murderous slot machine always haunting you. It’s splendid how just about every element feels&nbsp;<em>wrong.&nbsp;</em>I mean, I completely forgot to mention the flies buzzing around the bin of what I think might be meat that sits below the slot machine itself.</p> <p>So while this doesn’t manage to survive a comparison with the titan that is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it’s also the case that no one ever said it should have to. Though I’d love to feel a bit more autonomy over my chances of success, this is ultimately a game about the unfairness of a slot machine that’ll make you want to experience it over and over and over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now only four weeks out from the NYC marathon. It’s time to make sure you have all the gear you need picked out. What shorts you’re wearing, perhaps a belt to carry your phone, maybe a fresh pair of running shoes if your current pair are reaching their limit — lots of prep to be done. My question is, how satisfied are you with your watch? Do you even have a watch? Some folks in my run club choose to just carry their phone in hand. It always irks me when I’ve forgotten to charge my watch and now need to run with my phone, I can’t imagine just choosing to do that every time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Well, anyway, right now Garmin has its Forerunner 55 GPS watch on sale ahead of Prime Big Deals Day, going for 25% off.</a> You can save $50 as the price comes down from $200 to just $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Garmin Coach</h2>
<p>A GPS watch is your window into your performance. Track your miles, pace, time elapsed and more. The Garmin Forerunner 55 goes even further than than, able to act as your fitness coach. It can provide you with daily suggestions of varying intensities based on previous workouts and fitness level, tailoring your training to you. You can even plan your race day strategy with PacePro, offering GPS-based pace guidance for various courses or distances.</p>
<p>Beyond running, this watch can be used for cycling, Pilates, and even pool swims. When not being used for a workout, the watch can track useful health and wellness metrics such as your heart rate. A favorite feature of mine is Body Battery. This breaks down all your activity, heart rate, and other bits of data to estimate your energy level at any time throughout your day, allowing your to find the best time to either workout or get your rest in.</p>



<p>The Garmin Forerunner 55 has a 1.04-inch capacitive touch screen. It uses a transflective memory-in-pixel display which allows it to be seen clearly in direct sunlight and total darkness alike.</p>
<p>Battery life is super solid. The issue with using a smartwatch like the Apple Watch or a Samsung Galaxy Watch as your running watch is you’ll have to plug it in almost every night for a recharge. The Garmin Forerunner 55 can last up to two weeks. And like those other smartwatches, you can even receive emails, texts and other notifications right on your wrist after pairing it with your phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Choose between three different colors. The Garmin Forerunner 55 is available in either black, aqua, or white — all now discounted down to just $150.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a><span>, Sucker Punch’s samurai sequel, takes place hundreds of years after the original game, </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushim</span></i><span>a. Normally, when a studio sets a sequel this long after the first, it’s to make it easier for newcomers to jump in, and they don’t have to worry so much about continuity between previous games. For the most part, </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>is pretty separate from </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>, but it does have one side quest that directly ties the two together, answers some questions about what happened to the previous protagonist, Jin Sakai, and maybe raises a few more.</span></p>  <p><span>In the side quest titled “The Storm Blade,” <em>Yotei</em> protagonist Atsu is guided through a discrete area in Mount Yotei, which includes what looks like a centuries-old weapon cache full of some items fans might recognize, like a helmet and a horse saddle. As Atsu climbs through the area, she finds Jin Sakai’s sword hidden in a cave. Just then, however, she’s waylaid by enemies, one of whom steals the blade and makes his escape, prompting Atsu to give pursuit. Tracking him down, she also finds what seems to be Jin’s final home and resting place. We then learn from Ugetsu, the game’s resident storyteller, that Jin went on to become the first Shinobi and that “some say” he lived out his final days in Ezo. Once you complete the quest, you’ll get Jin’s sword and armor set.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re not planning on playing </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>yourself and want to see the full quest, here’s the whole thing courtesy of Ben-Gun on YouTube (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/5-years-later-ghost-of-yotei-finally-reveals-what-happened-to-jin-sakai-after-ghost-of-tsushima-in-a-secret-side-quest/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><i><span>).</span></i></p>   <p><span>Now that we know where Jin ended up after </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, there are still questions about what he was doing in Ezo and how he ultimately met his end. However, at least fans will have some closure here. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a> <span>is out today on PlayStation 5, and it sounds like it’s a pretty good successor to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290"><span>Sucker Punch’s</span></a><span> open-world samurai game, even if </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><span>it doesn’t really shake things up too much</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced a price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raising the price by 50% from $20 to $30 per month</a>. You do not have to pay that much everywhere, however. GameStop, for example, has <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will not raise the price of Game Pass Ultimate for in-store and online shoppers, at least not yet.</p><p>The retailer continues to sell one-month Game Pass Ultimate memberships for $20 or three-month memberships for $60. This appears to be a promotion, so it's not likely to last forever, meaning you may want to snap it up now before it's too late. The price comes down to $19 for one month or $57 for a three-month subscription if you're a GameStop Pro member ($25/year).</p><p>Beyond GameStop, mega-retailer Amazon is also continuing to sell <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass Ultimate for $20/month</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 for three months</a>, as are <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fmio2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fjxgyc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/1alltzu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.<a href="https://sovrn.co/1alltzu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><br></a></p><p>A variety of other online retailers are selling Game Pass Ultimate for $20 or less right now for a one-month membership, so be sure to shop around before signing up for the new, higher rate.</p><p>Microsoft's announcement of yet another price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was met with a negative response online. The price hike for Game Pass followed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">price increase of consoles, too.</a></p><p>Price increases were always expected, though, as subscription services are known to debut at a low price to drive adoption and then go up in price as the company behind them looks to monetize the base of subscribers. Still, the 50% price hike was more than many expected for Game Pass Ultimate, even with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">newly added perks like Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. </a></p><p>PC Game Pass is also going up in price, from $12/month to $16.50/month. Just like with Ultimate, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B0DX8GZ5VT?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Game Pass prepaid codes</a> are still available for the lower price at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B0CMZMYLKJ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass Core</a> and Game Pass Standard are changing names to Game Pass Essential ($10/month) and Game Pass Premium ($15/month), and there are no price hikes for those tiers.</p><p>Looking ahead, one industry analyst believes Microsoft could offer a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">lower-priced ad-based Game Pass tier</a> to help draw in more subscribers. Game Pass brings in lots of money already for Microsoft, as the company recently disclosed it reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. </a></p>

<p>Game launches this month!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (with a brief mention of the OG Switch version at the end), providing more than 6 minutes of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>, Z-A is the sort-of-sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> and takes place in Lumiose City with a revamped real-time battle system. The trailer goes over this along with the character customisation features, photo mode, the 'Z-A Royale Tournament', and more.</p>
<p>If you think the game looks a bit naff visually, you're not alone, and this trailer won't do much to convince you otherwise (though the interiors in 'Hotel Z' look pretty nice, admittedly), but it definitely looks like a pretty neat take on the long-running series nonetheless. We're pretty concerned about how this might look and run on the original Switch, though.</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now. Some of the new mechanics and modes here sound genuinely interesting, and hopefully this will more than make up for any visual or performance shortcomings.</p>
<p>Legends: Z-A will also offer up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Mega Dimension DLC</a> for <strong>£24.99</strong>, with early adopters receiving apparel sets on day one, with a story expansion arriving at some point before the end of February 2026.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/790186/super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-galaxy-deserves-more.1314730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has brought two of the very best <em>Super Mario</em> games to the Switch and Switch 2. It’s no surprise that <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> and its sequel are excellent; these are critically acclaimed games, and two of the best-selling titles for the Wii, Nintendo’s top-selling console prior to the Switch era. So it’s great to have a pair of the most inventive platformers ever made easily accessible in 2025. At the same time, these releases are disappointing in just how simple they are. Nintendo has an enviable amount of history and talent, and re-releases like this would be the ideal place to share that with the world. Alas, we get straightforward ports instead.</p><p>The <em>Galaxy</em> games, which originally debuted in 2007 and 2010, represent a sort of evolutionary offshoot of the 3D <em>Mario</em> platforming line. The sci-fi premise — which, among other things, introduced Rosalina to the world — involves Mario traveling to small planets, many of which are bite-sized spheres that fit on a single screen. The goal, as always, is to collect shiny stars to open up more levels to explore. But what makes <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel unique is how tightly-focused every level is. Each usually has a single idea that it explores <em>just</em> long enough before moving on to the next thing.</p><p>That design-first focus means that these games have aged remarkably well. It feels weird at first to not have complete control over the camera, but I adjusted pretty quickly, helped along by the fact that the levels are almost all small and designed around those camera limitations. Like the best <em>Super Mario</em> games, these are an explosion of ideas; one second you’re fighting against gravity while side-scrolling inside of a giant pill, the next you’re using Yoshi’s tongue to flip across perilous gaps. Given the way the <em>Super Mario</em> series has evolved, going in very different directions with releases like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch">the more open-ended <em>Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">the silly side-scrolling of <em>Wonder</em></a><em>,</em> there remains nothing like <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel.</p><p>I also love that playing with detached Joy-Con controllers is a pretty solid approximation of using an old Wii remote and nunchuk, a control scheme the original games were built around. (You’ll be doing a lot of pointing at the screen here.) Both <em>Galaxy</em> and its sequel also still look great; the mix of classic, cartoony Mario style and glittery sci-fi locales work really well together.</p><p>Which is probably why Nintendo hasn’t done much for these ports — they don’t need a lot of work to begin with. The resolution is a little better, there are touchscreen controls for when you’re playing in portable mode, the storybook elements have been expanded somewhat, and there’s a very welcome new “assist” mode that makes things a little easier. Even still, considering these releases cost $40 each (or $70 as a physical bundle) the lack of frills is disappointing.</p><p>This is pretty much par for the course for Nintendo. The most recent re-release of the first <em>Galaxy</em> came in the form of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em></a>, a similarly barebones collection on the original Switch that was inexplicably only available for a limited time. So I’m conflicted here. Yes, this is a chance for a whole new audience to play two incredible games. But would it have killed Nintendo to show these games just a little more love?

              <p>December feels forever away but here’s the thing: <strong>LEGO drops its Advent calendars in September</strong> for a reason. And if you’ve ever waited until November, you already know the truth: by then, the deals are gone, the stock’s low and you’re stuck paying full price. But right now, the LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 (the most loved one in the lineup) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/">is hiding on Amazon at an all-time low of just $25, down from $34.99</a>, and it’s available for everyone, Prime or not, until tomorrow night.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4349/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See LEGO City Advent Calendar 2025 at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Holiday Countdown That Feels Like Magic</h2>
<p>This isn’t just a calendar: It’s 24 bursts of joy, one door per day. Your kid (or you?) gets to open a fresh surprise every morning—mini builds, fun accessories, and adorable mini-figures—all the way through to Christmas. And what about the mini-figs: Santa and Mrs. Claus are on the job, along with laugh-out-loud hilarious characters of Santa in a reindeer costume, Mrs. Claus as a polar bear, and even Mrs. Claus as a walking Christmas tree.</p>



<p>The great part? It’s made for kids 5 and up and each little build has simple instructions tucked just behind the door. No frustration, no confusing instructions – just the happy “aha!” moment when they click the pieces into place. And the pièce de résistance: <strong>the calendar flips open into a big playmat</strong>. One minute it’s a countdown, the next it’s a winter wonderland holiday party scene where all the figures come to life. Kids can mix and match their other LEGO City sets, build wacky scenarios and play for hours.</p>
<p>Parents, pay attention: how many times can you receive a gift that provides something new each day? That keeps the anticipation going, promotes patience and sparks creativity without the use of a screen? This calendar does all of the above – and it’s only $25 today at Amazon. That’s close to a ten-dollar discount, and it doesn’t often go this low except for Prime Day or Black Friday.</p>

            <p>If you've been wondering what happened to the FIFA licence <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">after its departure from EA</a>, you now have the answer. FIFA Heroes has just been announced today, a 5-a-side football game starring several official FIFA mascots.</p>
<p>These mascots, presented in the announce trailer absent from gameplay footage, are cartoony representatives from three major countries. These include Clutch the eagle from the USA, Zayu the jaguar from Mexico, and of course Maple the moose from Canada.</p>
<p>These mascots will, according to the official press release coinciding with the announcement trailer, have their own "super abilities and special moves" in FIFA Heroes. Players will be able to play in PvE matches as well as online PvP, of course.</p>

<p>Christian Volk, Director of Gaming and eSports at FIFA, wrote in the FIFA Heroes press release: "At FIFA, uniting people through the love of football has always been our priority. With FIFA Heroes, fans can create a multiverse team: mixing their treasured fictional heroes, favourite players, and our own mascots. We're offering the love of football to a new generation, while rekindling the nostalgia and fun for families and older players who've grown up with FIFA. FIFA Heroes fits seamlessly into our digital football portfolio under the FIFAe umbrella, adding another strong pillar to our fast-growing gaming ecosystem."</p><p>Maybe it'll be good, but it's a significant departure from FIFA's previous incarnation within the video game industry. The old FIFA series, now EAFC, had built itself a sizable market share of the sports genre with its realistic depiction of football and its many professional players. FIFA Heroes, on the other hand, is taking the polar opposite approach.</p>
<p>FIFA Heroes will be available in 2026, though the specific date remains unknown. It'll be available on mobile, Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The news comes this week as EA releases its latest EA FC game, EAFC26. The game appears to be going down well among its fan-base, retaining much of the merits of the series' prior EAFC titles as well as the FIFA series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">EA parted with the FIFA brand back in 2022, but has remained the most popular football series despite the brand shift.</a>.

			<p>LEGO Voyagers might just be the cutest game ever. As my partner and I guided our adorable single-block Lego pieces though this co-op puzzle platformer, we emitted many a coo of ‘ooohhhh’ and ‘aaahhhh’, and thankfully it wasn’t followed by running and screaming. But is there more to Light Brick Studios’ latest LEGO adventure than looking disarmingly delightful?</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idgrndka0AQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Akin to the local and online co-op experience <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">offered by Hazelight Studios</a>, Lego Voyagers requires two players to work together to navigate through its isometric levels. Your eyed Lego pieces are steered like rolling wagon wheels, tumbling through the environment with clumsy abandon. Most of the levels are made up of those smooth Lego pieces that are much easier to dust on your display models than the studded ones. Though, every now and again, you’ll find some studs to attach to with the tap of a button. Like Katamari Damacy, you can end up coated in chunks of plastic, each impacting the physics of your character, causing you to trundle hilariously – and precariously – around the place.</p>


<p>Even better, both players can connect together with a stupendously satisfying ‘click’, and then can both take control of your Frankenstein-like Lego monstrosity, requiring you to work together to get around the place. It’s tremendous silly fun, and, thanks to a very quick respawn, frustration caused by the chaos is kept to an absolute minimum. Having said that, despite the kid friendly visuals, I can’t help but feel that the challenging physics-based controls might not make this one suitable to play with the smallest Lego-fans in your family.</p>


<p>Platforming is simple, which is a relief, as the isometric viewpoint prevents anything more complex. Even simple jumps are made agonisingly tricky by often being unable to tell where your player character is in the space. Once more, that aforementioned rapid respawn saves the day. Even if you’ve failed a basic jump several times or more, you’re hurled back into the action before irritation sets in.</p>
<p>In contrast to the hit and miss platforming, the puzzles are a delight, requiring both players to work together to solve numerous satisfyingly brain-ticking conundrums. One player might be tasked with controlling a bridge say, whilst the other player crosses it safely – or unsafely, if the first player is feeling cheeky. In my case, I often am.</p>
<p>The best puzzles are those that involve building something together from the random bits and bobs you find littered around the landscape. Often, you don’t quite know what you are building until suddenly the penny drops and you realise, you’re halfway through constructing a catapult to haphazardly fling your buddy over a hazardous ravine! Or, in a page straight out of Hazelight Studios’ co-op book, you’re tasked with controlling a boat together, one playing steering, the other accelerating. It’s easy charming fun, the game breezily flinging ideas at you, never waiting too long before moving onto the next one.</p>

<p>The only downside? It’s all over far too quickly. As such, it never quite feels like the game explores any one idea to a satisfying conclusion. You do a bit of something, it’s enjoyable, but it always feels like the mechanic could be further explored. Light Brick Studios clearly doesn’t want to stick with an idea too long, just in case you get bored. This, combined with a very short run time of a handful of hours, means that whilst Lego Voyagers is tremendous fun, it’s likely done and forgotten before the end credits have finished rolling.</p>

<p>As a side note, NVIDIA leveled its Miami and Warsaw, Poland SuperPODs to RTX 5080 hardware, with  Portland and Ashburn coming next. Two more PC games have also been enabled to take advantage of the increased computational power of the new RTX 5080 servers:</p>



<p>● <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inZOI</a> (Steam)<br>● <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War: Warhammer III</a> (Steam and Epic Games Store)</p>



<p>The GeForce NOW RTX Blackwell upgrade started rolling out last month. You can read my impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>:</p>



<p><em>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW was already by far the best cloud gaming experience available, and the RTX 5080 server upgrade, coupled with various other improvements, only increases the distance between the platform and its competitors. There is absolutely no question that, if you want to play games on the cloud, this is the way. The visual quality is now a near-match for the local experience, but the responsiveness is not. L4S adoption may help a little, but I suspect the physics limitations will remain a mostly unavoidable hurdle for the foreseeable future.</em></p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>will be "an arcade fast 5-a-side" game with "fantasy flair", and it'll feature iconic FIFA mascots, "football's biggest icons, and your favorite fictional characters from iconic TV shows and films".</p>

<p>Enver and FIFA are promising "dynamic physics and pitch-shattering power moves", so it's pretty clear that this isn't an&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>-style realistic simulation, as if the larger-than-life cast list outlined above didn't already give the (beautiful) game away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=TYDfcYDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fifa-heroes-announced-phone.jpg?itok=EhoOALGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know much about&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>&nbsp;yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature both PvE and PvP play modes; Enver and FIFA say you'll be able to "tackle PvE before going head to head with your mates" across "arcade fast matches and challenges", which will also help you "progress your club through PvE career milestones".</p>

<p>If you're a football aficionado, you'll know that the World Cup next year is being held across three host countries, and each of those countries' mascots is represented here: Maple for Canada, Clutch for the US, and Zayu for Mexico.</p>

<p>They're just three of the playable characters in&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes</em>, each of whom will have "their own super abilities and special moves", although it's not clear whether that's true of all of the playables or just the mascots.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>right here, although it's worth saying that it's more of a concept piece, since there's no identifiable gameplay in the trailer.</p>




<p><em>FIFA Heroes&nbsp;</em>is the latest officially-licensed&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>game to be announced since EA decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-fifa-games-to-be-replaced-with-ea-sports-fc-next-year" rel="nofollow">part ways with the organization</a> back in 2022, changing the name of its iconic&nbsp;<em>FIFA&nbsp;</em>franchise to&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

<p>In October last year, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">chose Konami as its new esports partner</a> following the split, although the governing body still hasn't chosen a flagship developer alongside whom to move forward with any kind of <i>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</i>competitor.</p>

<p>That has not, however, stopped FIFA from pursuing experiments in other areas, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-announces-4-world-cup-blockchain-games" rel="nofollow">unveiling of a range of Web3-related games</a> to coincide with the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Will the same thing happen for next year's tournament? We can only wait and see.</p>

            <p>Starbreeze have cancelled Project Baxter, the co-op live service Dungeons &amp; Dragons game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game-on-the-way-from-payday-devs">announced back in 2023</a>. Part of the development team have been transferred to other projects with Starbreeze, while the remainder get to "transition to new roles across the industry".</p>
<p>Starbreeze have told us little about Project Baxter over the years, beyond characterising it as an action-adventure that reflects their "lifetime commitment" to  Games-as-a-Service, and stating that it would support PC and console crossplay. They announced it with a couple of artworks - one depicting a close-cropped mage in a cape, the other some pointy roofs and pennants. The game surely would have built upon Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-payday-2">established</a>, albeit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-sales-significantly-lower-than-hoped-but-starbreeze-focused-on-long-term-success">recently eroded</a> reputation for co-op heisting. Now, however, Starbreeze bosses have decided that doubling down on Payday is the safer route forward.</p>
<p>"This was a difficult but necessary decision," comments CEO Adolf Kristjansson in <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">a release to investors</a>. "Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze's position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders."</p>
<p>Around 44 people, spanning employees and contractors, are to lose their roles at Starbreeze in the course of writing off Baxter. The press release adds that "the discontinuation of Baxter, combined with an increased focus on the Payday franchise, will enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026." For context, cash-flow positive means you have more money coming in over a given period, than going out - it's not the same as being overall profitable. Starbreeze <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-have-switched-ceo-six-months-after-disastrous-launch">made a huge loss in their financial year 2024</a> after a catastrophic launch showing for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. </p><p>Kristjansson ends the release by thanking the Baxter team and D&amp;D license owners Wizards of the Coast, adding that work on Baxter "will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze". Maybe they should give the laid-off Baxter team members a Special Thanks credit in Payday 4, assuming that's next on the agenda. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re closing in on Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s sales even taking place next week on October 7 and October 8. You can expect to see all sorts of deals covering a range of consumer tech, kitchen appliances, apparel, and more. Even though it’s not quite here yet, some deals have already started pouring in. Take a look over the the Fire HD 10. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">This Amazon tablet built for relaxation and fun normally is currently as much as 56% off.</a></p>
<p>There are four different versions of Amazon’s latest tablet. You can choose between having 32GB or 64GB of capacity as well as whether you want to put up with lock screen ads or not. If you don’t mind being bombarded with Alan Ritchson’s beefy shoulders and chiseled face promoting&nbsp;<em>Reacher&nbsp;</em>every time you reach for your tablet, you can get the Fire HD 10 for as low as $70. The 32GB is down to that from $140 while the 64GB is down to just $80 (originally $180). If&nbsp; you’d prefer not to have to look at ads on a device you own whenever you use it, you’re looking at a price point of $85 for the 32GB model and $95 for the 64GB model. If you end up going with the ad-enabled version but change your mind later, no worries. You can pay a one-time fee of $15 to have them removed after the fact.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 32GB at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 64GB at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As you can surmise from the name, this Fire HD 10 comes with a 10-inch HD 1080p screen (well, 10.1 inches to be precise). It makes for a terrific gift for the holidays for any friend, family member, or loved one.</p>
<h2>Bring Your Movies and Shows Anywhere</h2>
<p>This tablet supports a battery life of up to 13 hours. You’ll be able to binge an entire season or more of a TV show in one charge (at least a modern TV show from after we stopped making 24-episode long seasons).</p>



<p>The Fire HD 10 is both light and durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere easily. This tablet makes for a great travel companion as you’re able to download your favorite stuff to take along with you so you can watch movies or shows without having to pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>It’s equipped with a front-facing 5MP camera so you can keep in touch with family and friends using Zoom or any of the other video conferencing apps.</p>
<p>Choose between three different colors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">The Fire HD 10 is available in your choice of black, lilac, or ocean.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Federal investigators and researchers at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) are brushing up on gaming. A reportedly leaked briefing document shows the agency born out of 9/11 to combat global terrorism is taking a closer look at what&nbsp; “violent extremist US teens” are doing in online gaming platforms ranging from <em>Fortnite</em> to Battle.net.</p> <p>Published by <a href="https://danboguslaw.substack.com/p/leaked-intel-brief-shows-feds-terrified">independent journalist Dan Boguslaw</a>, the alleged NCTC document lists a bunch of different places people play games and each one’s functionality. The full list includes Battle.net, Discord, <em>Fortnite</em>, PlayStation Network,<em> Roblox, </em>Steam, Twitch, and Xbox Live. Discord, which the gunman who allegedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">assassinated Charlie Kirk</a> used to discuss the murder, is the only platform that’s listed as checking every functionality box: “text chat,” “voice chat,” “video chat,” “image sharing,” “friend lists,” and “discoverable communities.”</p>

 <p>“Some violent extremist US teens probably play online games or use gaming-affiliated networks and applications (apps), and could use these apps to communicate with like-minded individuals, conduct plotting, or spread terrorist messaging, judging from a past report of extremist use of online gaming to enable terrorist activity,” the leaked memo reads.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems pretty clear the government is coming for Discord users <a href="https://t.co/SFc4yApeAU">pic.twitter.com/SFc4yApeAU</a></p> <p>— Ken Klippenstein (NSPM-7 Compliant) (@kenklippenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1973463700918116392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You’ll note that the document isn’t concerned only with the plotting of potential terrorist activities but also “terrorist messaging,” whatever that is. Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, gaming-affiliated platforms like Discord, Twitch, and Steam have been called <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">to testify before Congress</a>. President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">recently proclaimed</a> Antifa a terrorist organization and the Heritage Foundation right-wing think tank <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/heritage-foundation-uses-bogus-stat-to-push-a-trans-terrorism-classification/">called on the FBI</a> to officially label “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or “TIVE,” as a domestic terrorism threat category.</p>

 <p>The reported NCTC memo is quick to point out in a footnote that “the mere presence of an individual on one or more online gaming platforms is not indicative of any nefarious activity,” and that “law enforcement action should not be taken solely on the basis of the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.” But it does say that communication on these platforms could be grounds for further investigation if authorities “observe suspicious behavior.”</p> <p>There are a few notable absences on the sheet. YouTube is not mentioned at all, despite a wealth of gaming content and an algorithmic engine for pointing users toward it like a fire hose. Nintendo Switch Online is also missing despite the fact that the Switch 2 just rolled out video sharing and GameChat. I guess the country’s terrorism experts don’t think anyone is plotting political violence inside <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

                <p>When it comes to building a winning team in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the right formation is just as important as the players you pick. A good formation can unlock your team’s true potential, while the wrong one can leave you exposed at every turn. But whether you’re someone who favors the gegenpress over tiki-taka, there’s a formation for you.</p><p>This guide will explain the <strong>best FC 26 formations</strong>, breaking down their strengths and weaknesses, while explaining what type of players you’ll need to make it work. From tried and tested setups like 4-2-3-1 Wide to more experimental systems like 3-5-2, we’ll help you find the perfect shape to dominate in your next Division Rivals or Career Mode game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_1_2_1_2_Narrow">4-1-2-1-2 Narrow</h2><p dir="ltr">The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow meta is back, and we couldn’t be more delighted. This diamond formation wasn’t really favoured in the FC 25 meta, but it’s having a bit of a resurgence.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s designed for players who want to dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, using quick passing and deep runs to open up their opponent’s defensive line. Your CDM acts as an anchor to help control the play with two box-to-box central midfielders, while a creative CAM acts as a Shadow Striker.</p><p dir="ltr">Two strikers up front are able to play off one another or hold up the ball for midfield reinforcements. As the name suggests, the formation is tight, so if the ball is overturned, the CDM should be sitting in the passing lanes waiting for the right ball to intercept.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation really only works if you have good fullbacks and a talented CDM for cover. Since the shape is quite predictable, it can be easy for an attacking squad to carve the backline open because of the space left behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we set up our squad:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: AxZKwE4#K8S</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Counter</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Sweeper Keeper, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Box-to-Box, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Poacher, Attack / Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_2_3_1_Wide">4-2-3-1 Wide</h2><p dir="ltr">If you used 4-2-3-1 last year, this will feel rather familiar. With four defenders, two CDMs, and one CAM, this is arguably one of the most balanced formations you can use.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation offers you control in transitional play, while giving you lots of attacking options up front. The CAM - acting as a Shadow Striker -is the creative link between the lone striker and the wingers, who should cut inside to receive passes. In defense, two CDMs support the four-strong defensive line, helping to cover the passing lanes to break up play.</p><p dir="ltr">We’ve set this up so that the CDMs are involved in build up play, but we’d recommend having a striker who can adequately fulfil an Advanced Forward role. We’ve also locked our fullbacks into a defensive set up, but if you want to stretch the play more, you can switch them to a balanced view.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we’ve set it up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: GZewNW4MwiDo</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Ball-Playing Keeper, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender/Ball-Playing Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (L): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (R): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_4_2_Holding">4-4-2 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This is one of the most popular formations in the game - and one that’s perfect if you’re just starting out. This is because your defense, midfield, and attackers are all perfectly balanced on the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">With four players in defense and midfield, it offers a strong defensive structure while offering you options in attack with two strikers. The wide midfielders and fullbacks can stretch the attack on the counter to create chances.</p><p dir="ltr">This balanced spread makes it difficult for opponents to find gaps to attack. However, with only two central players in midfield, you can find yourself overrun when coming up against teams that overload the middle of the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">To help counter this, we’ve opted to use the Holding version of the formation to reinforce the defense in light of FC 26’s reduced AI defending gameplay. This gives us two CDMs, rather than two central midfielders.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are our tactics in full:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: SBs8ciEacQ%U</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_3_3_Holding">4-3-3 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This formation is one of the most versatile attacking formations in the game, giving you plenty of width, decent midfield control, and clear attacking options. With three forwards you can stretch pretty much any defense with quick passing through both wide options and central midfield.</p><p dir="ltr">4-3-3 formations work really well for players who like to counter quickly and directly using plenty of width. If you want to slow it down, your midfield options can dictate the tempo with the fullbacks dropping in to create more space. The only problem is that this shape can be overrun by the formations above. If your midfielders are caught out of possession high up the pitch, you may struggle to win the ball back.</p><p dir="ltr">To counter this, we’ve set up our squad so we have a holding CDM, flanked by a deep-lying playmaker and a playmaker in central midfield. Our wingers will provide width in attack, with one wingback available on support duties.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re going to opt for this formation, you’re going to need strong, fast wingers who have decent shooting and passing stats. You’re also going to need a talented striker who can finish consistently from anywhere in the box.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s how we’d set this up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: EBdk%umK%GAm</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">RB: Wingback, Support</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Holding, Ball-Winning</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build-Up / Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">LW: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Wide Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Why_are_these_the_best_FC_26_formations_">Why are these the best FC 26 formations?</h2><p dir="ltr">With 29 different formations available in the game, you might be wondering why we’ve selected just four above. The simple answer is that they best fit the current meta, where compact shapes and quick passing dominate. The AI defending changes this year mean you have to rely on tight shape, passing lanes, and quick transitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the formations we’ve highlighted offer a strong defensive base, clear attacking patterns, and an adaptability that will help you gain the upper hand in competitive matches. The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow gives you central overloads and passing triangles, 4-2-3-1 Wide balances structure with creativity, 4-4-2 Holding gives you a balanced foundation to build from, and 4-3-3 stretches defense with pace and width.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the best FC 26 formations will change with future updates, but for now these are the tactics we’d use to gain the upper hand in Division Rivals, Ultimate Team, and Career Mode.</p>

As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Naoki Hamaguchi told Game Developer, adding the new interpretation of the story was deliberate to maintain player interest over time, considering that this remake treatment of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is split into three parts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to keep the players' interest in our game, but in order to do that, we can't simply just add new elements, that won't be enough," Hamaguchi said during an interview at Tokyo Game Show. "We wanted to add a new interpretation to the story, entirely new story elements, things like that to, again, sustain the player interest and have players look forward and be curious to the conclusion of the remake trilogy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When working on a remake, Hamaguchi said he first tries to think what the original players have in mind. In this case, what they loved about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There are parts he didn't want to alter or change and decided to keep as is, but there were others that the team wanted to create something new for the modern generation of players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, there are clear expectations in mind, which the team took into consideration to preserve that interest. For context, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched in April 2020, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rebirth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> following in 2024.

<figure data-uuid="45e366b1f66d0"><a title="Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45e366b1f66d0/super-mario-bros-2-the-lost-levels.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've <em>all</em> heard of Minus World, right? A glitched world in the original 1985 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, it was accessible via World 1-2 and is an infinitely-looping underwater level, similarly designed to World 7-2. It's one of the most legendary glitches in gaming history.</p>
<p>And, it turns out, its direct sequel <em>also</em> has its own Minus World. It's just taken almost 40 years to discover it, and speedrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq4ee6V3TiA">Kosmic</a> is the one who discovered it (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels-minus-world-levels-found-four-decades-later/">Nintendo Everything</a>!).</p>
<p>In both the Japanese and English releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_the_lost_levels">Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</a> (the actual Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan, available officially in the West via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_all-stars">All-Stars</a> bundle on the SNES), various glitched worlds are available, either changing the names, looping screens, or changing enemy behaviour.</p>
<p>However, it's that All-Stars collection where a Minus World is really tucked away, and it's incredibly complex to pull off. You have to first progress through some increasingly-glitched versions of levels; the idea is Kosmic is trying to get past B-8, but reaching B-7 the first time, he realised it was impossible to beat.</p>
<p>Saving, quitting, and reloading brought him back to a completely different level layout, but it allowed him to get past those impassable glitches and roadblocks. A glitched warp pipe (with part of a coin above it) in B-9 brought Kosmic back to World 1-1, but this didn't deter him.</p>

<p>Continuing to progress through glitched worlds until he reaches World B-D and, eventually, various glitched menu options. It's a lot easier to watch than read us explain it, so make sure you watch Kosmic's new video above to see just how <em>wild</em> some of these glitches get.</p>
<p>So, why did this take so long? Kosmic mentions that difficulty is probably the main reason, but he also believes that, because this glitch requires you to make much more progress in-game, and wasn't played by as many people, there's just lower interest in general.</p>
<p>Well, we're glad that someone was willing to dig deep into the glitch worlds of The Lost Levels, and it's a pretty amazing discovery after nearly 40 years.</p>

<figure data-uuid="24d4066719a76"><a title="&quot;OpenAI Is Trying To Get Sued&quot; - Nintendo IP Floods Sora 2 Video Generation App 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/24d4066719a76/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: OpenAI / Sora 2</em></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI recently released its dedicated Sora App, which is being pitched as a rival to TikTok and Instagram, with the key difference being that all the videos are generated via the <a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/">Sora 2 video generation model.</a></p>
<p>As is the case with many of these Generative AI tools, Sora 2 has been trained on millions of hours of human-made footage which already exists online, almost always without permission – and that includes copyrighted material created by the likes of Sega, Nintendo and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Sora 2 has only been available for a day or so, and most social network feeds are already flooded with videos generated using the tool, many of which blatantly steal intellectual property, including Nintendo's.</p>
<p>This fact hasn't been lost on the many people on social media.</p>




<p>It's not just Nintendo's IP which is being infringed here; <strong>Sonic</strong> appears in many Sora 2-generated videos, too.</p>

<p>OpenAI has previously stated that it has adopted an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-new-sora-video-generator-require-copyright-holders-opt-out-wsj-reports-2025-09-29/">'opt-out' policy regarding IP</a> – that means IP owners need to contact OpenAI to have their IP removed from the Sora 2 training database. Critics argue that it's basically the equivalent of robbing a bank and only returning the money when you're told it's not yours.</p>

<p>It's not just the world of video games which is being replicated here without permission; anime and movies are also being reproduced, thanks to the fact that advanced video models like this are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright">betraying their training data with more accuracy</a> than ever before.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the notoriously litigious Nintendo will take this lying down, but many AI sceptics are predicting legal action from multiple IP owners in response to Sora 2's flood of cloned material. Last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-is-reportedly-targeting-ai-generated-mario-pictures">takedowns were filed</a> against AI-generated images featuring Mario and other Nintendo characters.</p>
<p>Generative AI is a hot topic in the world of video games these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">with a recent report claiming that over half of Japanese developers are using AI in some form</a>. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">maintained</a> that it won't be making use of the controversial technology, at least for the time being.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-zaum-union</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/za-um-workers-form-uks-first-official-gaming-union.1314640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers at&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>studio ZA/UM have unionized in the form of the newly-created Workers' Alliance, becoming the first officially-recognized UK gaming union into the bargain.</p>

<p>As reported by the folks at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the ZA/UM Workers' Alliance will legally represent only a portion of the studio's overall workforce, since it only applies to the UK arm of a company that also has offices in Portugal and Finland.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, marketing manager Poppy Ingham says the union was set up in order to give employees "a seat at the table in the big management meetings". She says ZA/UM workers "like being here" and "want to continue being here", and she wants the studio to be "a collaborative project between the workers and management".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=mXP00FAu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-zaum-uk-union-cuno.jpg?itok=pYHZ5Aoj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZA/UM's only game so far is anarchic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the new union only represents UK employees at the moment, Ingham says meetings are "completely open" to employees from other ZA/UM branches, and that those employees can "feed in" on the Workers' Alliance's activities.</p>

<p>According to Ingham, ZA/UM management has agreed to negotiate and consult with Workers' Alliance on issues that "ensure the general safety and care of employees", including pay rates, holiday time, and working hours.</p>

<p>The formation of the union at ZA/UM follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellation of a project at the studio</a> back in early 2024, which was itself accompanied by a round of layoffs. Ingham says it's these layoffs, "unfortunate" though they were, that "spurred [the remaining workers] on" to create Workers' Alliance.</p>

<p>ZA/UM has been racked with controversy since key figures Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">departed the studio</a> in 2022, with both claiming their departures were a result of being forced out by unscrupulous investors.</p>




<p>Since then, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">number</a> of key&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">personnel</a> have announced their own spiritual successors to the critically-acclaimed RPG.</p>

<p>Additionally, ZA/UM itself has also unveiled&nbsp;<em>Zero Parades - For Dead Spies&nbsp;</em>(which was probably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">formerly known as <em>Project C4</em></a>), a game that looks very much to be in the same realm as&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

            <p>Fortnite developers Epic Games have confirmed they'll be redeploying the 'Peaceful Hips' emote added to the battle royale as part of a crossover with superhero show Peacemaker, but with some modifications. This follows the dance being pulled from the game earlier this week, due to Epic's concerns about "creative intentions" in the aftermath of a big plot twist in the TV show.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is your spoiler warning if you don't want to know about <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/peacemaker-twist-earth-x-prejudice">the Peacemaker twist in question</a>. Right, so one of the show's recent episodes sees protagonist Chris Smith, that's Peacemaker, discover that an alternate dimension he's been visiting is actually Earth-X, a version of Earth that exists in an alternate timeline which saw the Nazis win World War 2. Thus, America's a fascist state, right down to the flag having a big swastika on it. Cue a controversy, as some poses in the dance of Fortnite's 'Peaceful Hips' emote could suddenly be viewed as potentially resembling the shape of a swastika.</p>
<p>So, Epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842">opted to disable the emote</a> while they talked to Warner Bros. in order to investigate the "creative intentions" of the emote. The result was Warner Bros saying they didn't intend the dance to have any Nazi connotations.</p> <div>

<p>"We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline," a fresh tweet from Epic reads. "To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket."</p><p>It seems bizarre, given that the collaboration is so recent, that Epic wouldn't have been given some kind of heads-up about this potentially controversial twist in Peacemaker's latest season. While Warner Bros might not have anticipated that the twist would lead to such an issue for the game publisher, it's a definite failure in communication. We'll see if the situation leads to any changes in how Epic handles collaborations down the road.</p>

              <p>Technically, you can use your standard office monitor for gaming, but is it the same as a dedicated screen that’s built to chase enemies with exceptional refresh rates and near-instant response time? Not really.</p>
<p>You need gear that keeps up, and right now, you can upgrade without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">Amazon has dropped the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) to just $110, which is a massive 45% off.</a> You’re saving $90 on a display that’s going to make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action, but the discount ends soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mind-Boggling Refresh Rate, Stunning Screen</h2>
<p>Lags and blurs are frustrating. You can’t just sit and wait for your screen to catch up while your opponent gets away. Odyssey G3 packs an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time for ultra-fast visuals that give an in-game advantage. Jumping on an enemy squad the moment you spot them, or slipping away from a close fight, becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Bid farewell to image tearing and mid-action interruptions, too, because AMD Radeon FreeSync makes sure your monitor and graphics card stay in sync – always in real time. There’s Black Equalizer to brighten dark areas in the game, and Virtual Aim Point to line up shots more precisely. Basically, whether you’re checking dark corners for bad guys or going for the clutch shot, this monitor keeps up. Even better, blue light is actively minimized to keep your eyes comfortable, and reduced screen flicker makes it easier to fight the demons for longer.</p>



<p>As for the screen itself, you’re getting a decent 24-inch FHD display that pushes stunning, vibrant visuals. The 3-sided borderless design offers maximum space to play, and will also come in handy when you run a dual-monitor setup. The monitor’s height can be fully adjusted, and you can tilt, swivel, or pivot it to match your ideal setup. Port-wise, you’ll find a Power port, Headphone IN, HDMI IN, and a DisplayPort IN around the back.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing on your standard monitor or laptop and want to upgrade to something more powerful, the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) is an excellent option to consider. It gets you an exceptional display with an even better refresh rate and response time, which are sure to take your gaming experience up a notch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The monitor usually retails for $200, but this deal brings it down to $110, which is a much more affordable price point.</a></p>
