            <p>
Springloaded Software, the developer behind 2021's animal-splicing tycoon game Let's Build a Zoo, has unveiled Let's Build a Dungeon - a new "multi-layered" management sim in which players attempt to run a game development studio while creating their own MMORPG.
</p>
<p>
Let's Build a Dungeon's first layer comes in the form of studio management, with players needing to recruit staff (including artists, programmers, planners, and testers); manage project deadlines, advertising campaigns, and press relationships; negotiate with shareholders, and pitch to publishers, all in the hope of rising from indie start-up to mega-blockbuster studio.
</p>
<p>
But alongside the business stuff, players also need to get creative and build their own fantasy MMO - which could be anything from a creature-catching RPG to a cosy farming sim - filling it with towns, monsters, dungeons, and quests, all tailored to satisfy their virtual playerbase's demands and expand its audience. And it's even possible to jump into your creation at any time to experience it through the eyes of your players.

<p>
"Place every tree, build every quest and decide on job classes for visiting virtual players as you watch them explore in real time," Springloaded explains. "Increase drop rates if they are struggling, or boost enemy stats to keep them grinding for XP. The more time spent in your world, the happier your investors will be!"
</p>
<p>
"Will you risk financial ruin by delaying your game until it's perfect or push your staff to breaking point with crunch time and salary cuts?," the studio adds. "Will you bow to community requests, or stay true to your creative vision?"
</p>
<p>
Let's Build a Dungeon features a campaign in which players can develop new items, environments, and mechanics for their MMO, but there's also a sandbox-style Creative Mode too, where they can write their own stories and dialogue, draw characters, create cutscenes, and tinker with gameplay mechanics. And then the finished thing can be shared online or uploaded to an in-game browser.
</p>
<p>
It all sounds a lot more ambitious than Springloaded's enjoyable if rather lightweight Let's Build a Zoo, and it'll be fascinating to see how the studio plans to pull these different elements together into something with a manageable focus. All will be revealed when Let's Build a Dungeon launches for Xbox and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2365790/Lets_Build_a_Dungeon/">Steam</a> at some currently undisclosed future point - and there'll be a chance to take a peek even sooner via an open beta, with <a href="http://letsbuildadungeon.com/">sign-ups open now</a>.

Several gameplay videos showed off what looked like an ‘00s-era Bratz game: big-lipped, big-headed femme characters with bedroom eyes in a variety of skimpy outfits walking down a runway and posing at the end of it while a simple dance beat plays in the background.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I didn’t really understand the allure, and like many <em>Roblox</em> games, <em>Dress to Impress</em> seems to be mostly played by children. But before long, <em>Dress to Impress</em> (or <em>DTI</em> as those in the know call it) was everywhere—in my day-long charity event, in my friend group, on the streams of high-profile influencers like CaseOh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKz6EVXTmGE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKz6EVXTmGE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Beer.</a></span> Earlier this month, it peaked at well over 370,000 concurrent players, according <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rolimons.com/game/15101393044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rolimons.com/game/15101393044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to fan-run <em>Roblox</em> site Rolimon’s</a></span>. So what’s the special sauce that’s making <em>Dress to Impress</em> so popular? And who is behind this viral fashion game?</p><h2 id="h355"><a id=""></a><strong>How to dress to impress</strong></h2><p>The <em>Dress to Impress</em> concept is simple: you join a server, are given a theme (like “Dark Coquette” or “Holiday” or “Heroes Vs Villains”), and have a few minutes to put together an outfit from a curated selection, style your hair, do your makeup, and paint your nails. When the time is up, you walk down the runway, choosing a few poses to pull at the end of your strut. Players in your lobby will award each look between one and five stars, and the top three will get podium placement. Then, you rinse and repeat this process with a new theme.</p><p><em>Dress to Impress</em> leans into one of the funnier elements of gaming: panic. There’s not a ton of time to put together your look, and there are separate timers for hair styling and skin tone selection that make it especially stressful for a new player trying to figure out how to navigate the menus. The clubby Y2K music speeds up as you near the end of the round, but you can’t make your character walk any faster than a stroll, so hilarity ensues in the final moments, especially if you’ve accidentally forgotten to give her a face (I did twice). Plus, a jump button hilariously ragdolls these wannabe models, which makes for pure chaos in the dressing room. The first round I play, I can’t figure out how to take any of the clothes <em>off</em>, so I walk out with three pairs of shoes on, each heel visually clipping through the other, tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ecfc4b1af176641fdca8810637c8728e" data-recommend-id="image://ecfc4b1af176641fdca8810637c8728e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A model wears a blue and yellow outfit in the Dress to Impress dressing room.

You can use Robux to buy better outfits and flashier accessories, which means the people (again, ostensibly kids) willing to fork over real money for in-game advantages will often win every round. $6,000 in <em>Dress To Impress</em> costs 1,500 Robux, and $20 will get you 1,700 Robux, though, confusingly, some of the outfits available for purchase can only be bought with Robux, not <em>DTI </em>dollars. As for how far your cash will go—not very: A cute flouncy skirt and shirt set will run you $1,800 in <em>Dress to Impress</em> money, while a shimmery faux-nude number costs $5,000, though any clothes you buy will at least remain unlocked on your <em>DTI</em> account for future use.<br></p><p>So far I’ve only played <em>Dress to Impress</em> the free way, pulling items from the mannequins that don’t cost any Robux or <em>DTI</em> dollars. I’ve played about a dozen rounds and only made the podium once during an Elements-themed showcase in which I put my model in head-to-toe flame print. This shit is rigged (and yes, there do appear to be cheaters who can “bot” the votes).<br></p><h2 id="h356"><a id=""></a><strong>Everyone’s dressing to impress</strong></h2><p>The <em>Dress to Impress </em>Discord server has over 237,000 members at the time of publication, many of whom are teenagers (including those in the developer channel). But <em>Dress to Impress </em>is taking the gaming world by storm, breaking out of <em>Roblox </em>containment in a manner heretofore unseen, ushering in new, older players to join the relatively young player base. </p><p>Interestingly, despite how youthful many of the players I encounter are, putting together a look in <em>Dress to Impress</em> feels like dressing background characters for a <em>Euphoria</em> episode—the models walk on Barbie tip-toes even without heels on, their bodies are uniformly thin and big-boobed, the makeup options offer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.allure.com/story/siren-eyes-tiktok-trend&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.allure.com/story/siren-eyes-tiktok-trend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">siren eyes</a></span> and Kylie Jenner lips pre-dissolution of her filler. And the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNtc8G5C/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNtc8G5C/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently announced a partnership with pop superstar Charli XCX</a></span> to promote her latest studio album, <em>Brat</em>. The looks for the <em>Dress to Impress </em>x <em>Brat </em>collection include thongs peeking out over miniskirts, sky-high heels with straps that lace all the way up the model’s legs, and PVC two-pieces.<br></p><p>But again, this is ostensibly a children’s game, and the people behind it all appear to be rather young as well. The dev channel on the official Discord has intros for those working behind the scenes on <em>Dress to Impress</em>. Many of them are teenagers who live all over the globe (Lebanon, Hungary, Thailand) and worship pop stars like Charli XCX, Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. The “owner” of <em>Dress to Impress</em>, known only as Gigi, is herself 17 years old. A 14 year old claims to be one of the game’s 3D modelers, showcasing just how impressively talented the youth of today is—and reminding us of the questionable morality that is <em>Roblox </em>content created via child labor. <em>Roblox</em> was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-banned-blocked-turkey-child-exploitation-why-1851616972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-banned-blocked-turkey-child-exploitation-why-1851616972">recently banned in Turkey</a></span> amid concerns over child exploitation, and in April, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza suggested</a></span> that the game was “a gift” for “15 year olds, in Indonesia, living in the slums.”<br></p><p>I reached out to a few <em>Dress to Impress </em>devs, as well as <em>Roblox</em> PR, but didn’t get a response in time for publication. While I wait, you can find me trying to get on that damn podium again, paying players be damned. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s rather common these days for developers to alter a remaster or remake, sometimes significantly, to enhance the experience for modern audiences. Or, so they claim. Some developers take things a step too far and start cutting out content that they feel the community wouldn’t enjoy, but they never ask the community at large. There’s some concern with Capcom’s approach. So, what’s going on with the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster censorship claims?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-censored">Is Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Censored?</h2>



<p>If you spend any amount of time online, looking at or discussing video games, then you’ll stumble upon loud individuals who call out every upcoming video game for censorship of some sort. Some complaints are rooted in reality, and some aren’t. It’s tough to discern which is which when the argument solely revolves around yelling.  But if you pay attention, you can follow the claims for yourself. For instance, there’s the censorship in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, or so many claim.</p>



<p>This censorship involves changes to the dialogue, specifically a boss fight involving Cliff Hudson. In the upcoming remaster, Cliff no longer refers to the player as a “filthy communist.” That dialogue line was scrubbed entirely. It’s rubbing people the wrong way for a number of reasons, primarily because this is a mature-rated game and should retain the dialogue from the original game.</p>



<p>Secondly, Capcom <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-erotic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the ability to earn Prestige Points by taking erotic photographs</a> in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. In the original game, if you snapped a photo of a survivor’s cleavage, you would receive points that count toward your next level-up. But in the remaster, that system is removed entirely. Capcom said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When developing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, we tried our best to create a game that would please returning core fans and appeal to new players alike. As development progressed, we inevitably discovered that we couldn’t include everything from the original game. In the case of the Erotica points system, this was something we discussed at length and decided to remove; not so much as a response to a changing cultural climate, but because we felt there is no need to have a reward points system on this basis. Additionally, when considering Frank’s situation, it is not an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive for the next 72 hours during a zombie apocalypse. However, players will still have the right to choose their picture subjects freely, and even though they won’t receive points, it is up to them to decide what photos they will take to represent their journey.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="h-how-much-does-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-cost">How Much Does Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Cost?</h2>



<p>Many refuse to purchase or pre-order the game due to the many claims of censorship in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. But you’re an individual and can make that decision for yourself. You may want to know about its pricing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster – $49.99</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Digital Deluxe – $59.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>If you pay $10 more for the Digital Deluxe, then you’ll receive a handful of in-game goodies, such as the Frank West 2006 Costume, Chucke Green Costume, and Willamette Parkview Mall Bee Costume, all of which you can activate and wear at the Security Room.</p>

Longthrone noted that players will have to figure out the dispositions of the NPCs to learn what they respond to. As an example, she included a sample interaction between Phyre and a character named Lou Graham. The same response from Phyre was interpreted differently by Lou based on how the player had interacted with her in the past.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4350220-bloodlines2dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350220" data-ratio="0.57153846153846" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4350220-bloodlines2dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350220"></a><figcaption>A sample dialogue interaction from Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4350220-bloodlines2dialogue.jpg"></figure><p>"What worked once won’t necessarily work every time," added Longthrone. "We don't want you getting complacent, picking options transactionally to fill up some bar or progress some metric; we want you thinking, and engaging from moment to moment. As a Kindred would."</p><p>Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 - Vault Edition Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In previous years, Activision gave PlayStation users first access to Call of Duty betas because Sony paid Activision for this. However, now that Microsoft owns Call of Duty, everyone across Xbox and PlayStation will get in at the same time. Xbox's Phil Spencer promised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-aiming-for-100-call-of-duty-parity-on-playstation-and-nintendo-exclusive-skins-and-betas-might-be-done/1100-6518470/" data-ref-id="1100-6518470">"parity"</a> for the Call of Duty series between Xbox and PlayStation, and this seems to be part of that. The executive also recently discussed how Microsoft wants to avoid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-cod-under-microsoft-wont-try-to-do-slimy-platform-things/1100-6524115/" data-ref-id="1100-6524115">"slimy"</a> platform policies surrounding exclusive content for Call of Duty.</p><p>Activision has yet to reveal what's in the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, but it's expected to include a sampling of the maps and modes from the full game. The publisher will share more details on Black Ops 6's multiplayer during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28.</p>

It gives the cities in those PS2-era games so much character and makes them feel like lived-in places filled with real people and all their junk. But all that flying trash disappeared in 2004's massive <em>GTA</em>: <em>San Andreas.</em> So what happened? Turns out, not everyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vice-city-rockstar-developer-blog-secrets-1851044987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vice-city-rockstar-developer-blog-secrets-1851044987">developing the 3D-era <em>GTA </em>games</a></span> liked all that trash flying around. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1823703886407901506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1823703886407901506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an August 14 tweet from Obbe Vermeij</a></span>, a former Rockstar North dev, the creator explained that the digital streets in <em>GTA 3</em> looked “too clean” so he “added litter.” </p><p>“[Trash in <em>GTA 3 </em>is just a] single rectangle that occasionally moves with the wind. It can also be dragged along by passing cars. The artists created four textures for it. Two newspapers and two leaves,” explained Vermeij.<br></p><p>This same system was used in <em>Vice City</em>, but with a small change. After players completed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wU0YaRA4F9k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wU0YaRA4F9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a specific mission</a></span>, which saw them drop flyers from a plane, one of the four textures was replaced with those flyers. This was a detail I always noticed as a young lad and something I loved about <em>Vice City.</em><br></p><p>And if you wondered why trash would sometimes phase through the ground in <em>GTA 3 </em>and <em>Vice City</em>, it’s because of how the debris detects the height of the ground while it moves around. It only checks where the ground is when it lands, so it can sometimes slip through the map during animations. </p><h2 id="h1513"><a id=""></a>Why <em>GTA 3</em>'s trash is in <em>Manhunt </em>but not <em>San Andreas</em></h2><p>When <em>San Andreas</em> was released in 2004, I remember being a little disappointed that all the trash from <em>GTA 3</em> and <em>Vice City </em>was missing. Sure, all the other cool new stuff in Rockstar’s open-world sequel was great, but I did wonder where the trash went. At the time, I thought perhaps moving paper was too much for the game to handle with everything else going on. Turns out it was just because some devs didn’t like all the debris flying around. </p><p>“Not everyone on the team liked the litter. I removed it for <em>San Andreas</em> because I eventually lost the argument,” posted Vermeij. </p><p>However, the trash appeared in <em>Manhunt</em>, a stealth game focused on murder which was also developed by Rockstar North and released the year prior to S<em>an Andreas</em>. So how did that happen? According to Vermeij, it’s because some <em>GTA </em>devs helped out during the “last months of <em>Manhunt’s </em>development.” And he took the time to add back in the “litter code” from <em>GTA 3. </em><br></p><p>Who knew a few pieces of trash blowing in the wind could be so interesting?

<p>Dr Disrespect is still playing cryptic games on social media and has been posting more images that nobody can decipher. It’s widely assumed he’s shaping up to make a grand return to streaming, but the question is, how well will he be received?</p>



<p>In the latest chapter in this sordid saga, Dr Disrespect has deleted the post on social media that he published admitting to his wrongdoing that got him banned from Twitch in 2020. This was the post that clearly stated he did inappropriately message a minor in 2017. </p>



<p>Nobody knows why he has deleted this post, but everyone has a theory.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dr-deletion">Dr Deletion</h2>



<p>Dr Disrespect has been absent from the internet almost entirely since the news surfaced that he’d messaged a minor on Twitch seven years ago. He announced he would be taking a break from streaming as he headed off on an extended vacation, and since then, all he has posted are some mysterious and puzzling images on X.</p>



<p>Since the revelations about Dr Disrespect were made public, the charismatic and controversial streamer lost almost all of his sponsorships and was cut from Midnight Society, the studio that he helped found. He also haemorrhaged followers, losing tens of thousands in the space of a few days.</p>



<p>Despite Dr Disrespect saying he ‘takes responsibility’ for his actions, he has gone and deleted the post on social media that made clear the events from his perspective. It means little, though – the sheer number of places where his message was repeated is endless, and he’ll never escape what he did.</p>

Sprinklers allow you to save time and energy everyday by watering your crops for you, with the trade off being that you have to build your fields around the sprinklers. Each tier of sprinkler offers a different coverage area.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to craft each sprinkler</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three types of sprinklers in Stardew Valley: sprinkler, quality sprinkler, and iridium sprinkler. The base sprinkler is unlocked at farming level 2 and requires 1 copper bar and 1 iron bar to craft. The quality sprinkler unlocks at farming level 6 and requires 1 iron bar, 1 gold bar, and 1 refined quartz to craft. Refined quartz can be made by putting either quartz or lava quartz into a furnace with a piece of coal.</p><p dir="ltr">The iridium sprinkler unlocks at farming level 9 and requires 1 gold bar, 1 iridium bar, and 1 battery pack. Battery packs are obtained from lightning rods, which can be crafted at foraging level 6. During a storm, lightning will activate the lightning rod and create a battery pack.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Sprinkler layouts</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4337303-sprinklerssetup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4337303-sprinklerssetup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337303"></a><figcaption>From left to right is the correct layout for the sprinkler, quality sprinkler, and iridium sprinkler.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4337303-sprinklerssetup.jpg"></figure><p>Each sprinkler has a specific layout, based on the number of tiles it can water. As seen in the picture above, the basic sprinkler covers four squares, to the left, right, top, and bottom of the sprinkler. The quality sprinkler covers eight squares, in a circle around the sprinkler.</p><p dir="ltr">The iridium sprinkler covers 24 spaces, in a 5x5 square, with the center space lost to the sprinkler itself. Late into Stardew Valley, you can also acquire sprinkler upgrades, including one that slightly boosts the range of the sprinklers.</p>

A seemingly simple tweak to flame effects and damage mechanics made it much harder for the weapon to melt through the alien bugs’ tough outer armor. Though frustrating on its own, the nerf ended up sparking a much bigger debate over how to balance a PVE-only game and why development teams so often feel like the fun police. </p><p>The studio now says that while it can’t necessarily walk back last week’s flamethrower changes without breaking other things in the game, it’s heard the feedback and charting a different course, including a 60-day revamp of some underlying glitches and performance issues on PC. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update,” game director Mikael Eriksson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a recent Reddit post</a></span>. “Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction.”</p><p>He continued by listing the studio’s goals for the next two months:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Our aim within the next 60 days:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Continue to re-examine our approach to balance. Our intention is that balance should be fun, not “balanced” for the sake of balance.</li><li>Update how the fire damage mechanic works to tweak how the flamethrower serves as a close range support weapon. (A quick straight revert won’t work, as it would break other things)</li><li>Rework gameplay to prevent excessive ragdolling</li><li>Re-think our design approach to primary weapons and create a plan for making combat more engaging </li><li>Re-prioritize bug fixes so that the more immediate gameplay-impacting bugs are prioritized.</li><li>Improve game performance (frame rate is a focus)</li><li>Rework Chargers </li></ul><p>Additionally, from a bigger picture perspective we will be:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Exploring creation of an opt-in beta-test environment to improve our testing processes and we consider this a high-priority.</li><li>Post regular player surveys to gather more insights and feedback from the community.</li><li>Improve our process for patch/release notes - providing more context and reasoning behind changes.</li><li>More blog posts and streams where we expand on these topics for those interested.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The big takeaway here is that Arrowhead is going to prioritize “fun” over “balance” more going forward. That’s harder than it sounds, since a big part of the fun of <em>Helldivers 2 </em>is feeling like you’re just barely scraping by in an impossible situation, or sometimes even getting completely destroyed and feeling inspired by that. While that doesn’t mean some situations can’t feel frustrating or cheap, the solution isn’t simply a matter of making players stronger and leaning more into an OP power fantasy. Maybe that’s why this isn’t the first time Arrowhead <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">has struggled with this post-launch tightrope walk</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">But after six months out in the wild</a></span>, it also seems like a smart time for <em>Helldivers 2</em> to slow down the pace of its changes as the devs take stock of where the game is at and how to continue growing it together with the community that remains after the initial boom of players has quieted down a bit. And some of those players aren’t satisfied with Eriksson’s mea culpa and are waiting for more durable proof of a new direction for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. </p><p>“Nice words but this is easily the second if not third ‘ooops we made a booboo and we’ll talk and change’ community address,” wrote one player by the name of ExcelsAtMediocrity. “If you guys have a vision and want to keep the core 5000 players that’s fine and your prerogative but you need to decide what direction it’s going and clearly communicate it and then do it consistently.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Night Shyamalan’s latest movie, <em>Trap</em>, takes place mostly during a pop star’s concert, which is certainly a unique gimmick. The throngs of screaming girls, booming music, and shuffling crowds create a tense and frustrating atmosphere as Josh Hartnett’s character (a father who is secretly a serial killer) tries to evade the police who are monitoring the event and find a way to escape. While Shyamalan’s films often require a suspension of disbelief (why do the aliens in <em>Signs </em>whose weakness is water invade a planet that is covered in it?), <em>Trap </em>introduces us to a truly bizarre concert that would never exist in real life.<br></p><p>Ironically, M. Night Shyamalan prides himself on the music event’s authenticity, telling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/m-night-shyamalan-and-daughter-talk-the-concert-of-trap-8689657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/m-night-shyamalan-and-daughter-talk-the-concert-of-trap-8689657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Entertainment Weekl</em>y</a></span>, “We did make a real concert, and that was part of the joy of it and the complexity. Behind Josh, there’s a real concert going on, and the extras are reacting to that. It took months and months to think about that, with Saleka [his real-life daughter who plays singer Lady Raven] and I analyzing who this woman is and how she would put on a show.” </p><p>But for all this meticulous planning, the final portrayal of this very public and chaotic setting feels nothing like a real-life concert. Usually we can chalk it up to Hollywood contrivances and just have fun and go along for the ride, but so much of <em>Trap </em>relies on this concept that’s difficult to buy into. This list breaks down all the strange parts of Lady Raven’s concert that left us scratching our heads.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b2a84a1cdbad24f5c32119a8abbb1f3" data-recommend-id="image://2b2a84a1cdbad24f5c32119a8abbb1f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Trap concert venue as seen from the parking lot.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Parking at a concert is normally a lengthy ordeal where you have to navigate a maze of occupied spots to find one for yourself. Often, there’s lots of people tailgating or searching for spots. Once you do find one, it’s usually far away from the venue and you have to remember a marker to locate it after the show when the entire audience is also exiting. Many fans even leave early to avoid the post-concert crowd surge. In <em>Trap</em>, Cooper and his daughter just smoothly pull up to an empty spot that is relatively close to the arena. Obviously M. Night Shyamalan wouldn’t want to waste valuable screen time on the nuances of parking, but a longer walk to the arena could’ve been another opportunity for Cooper to notice the heightened security.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d53047ae8a7bfb0d04a24f91233becbf" data-recommend-id="image://d53047ae8a7bfb0d04a24f91233becbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dozens of police officers stand outside the concert.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When Cooper and his daughter Riley arrive, the doors are already open. The line is rather chill and moves quickly, with no fussing over bag sizes or stopping to go through metal detectors. Cooper and Riley even manage to see Lady Raven arrive with her tour bus, despite it being so close to showtime. Does Lady Raven not do sound checks?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8505feb29bb7d3f0c4f33eb52fe9f8a" data-recommend-id="image://c8505feb29bb7d3f0c4f33eb52fe9f8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Trap's &quot;happy&quot; family stands together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Broadway shows and movie theaters have matinees, but not huge arena concerts. Not only would the clean-up and set-up in between be a logistical nightmare, but the tailgating, line-waiting, and other concert rituals would be rushed and impossible to execute. There’s an offhanded explanation that Lady Raven decided to add another concert in Philadelphia after the first one sold out, but second shows are almost always scheduled for a different night. Maybe M. Night Shyamalan wanted to use the day-to-night transition to symbolize the two halves of Cooper’s lives meeting in the middle. But it would have been equally cool (and made more sense) to have the concert occur at night, with the tense events at Cooper’s home bleeding into the next day.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-recommend-id="image://4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett snacks at his seat at the concert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett snacks at his seat at the concert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-recommend-id="image://4cbc0592beaa2ba6711e45128e650cbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett snacks at his seat at the concert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not unusual for a concert to have an intermission. Even the Eras Tour, which is three hours and goes through Taylor Swift’s entire discography, has brief pauses marked by on-screen interludes. But the intermissions in Lady Raven’s concert are so long that fans can meander through the concourse multiple times. This makes me wonder just how robust Lady Raven’s catalog is. How early did she have to start this concert if she’s taking so many breaks? When is the next concert supposed to start?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-recommend-id="image://f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks up as concertgoers hold their phones with flashlights lit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks up as concertgoers hold their phones with flashlights lit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-recommend-id="image://f2f068a5e81214c824b9c8784e30c42a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks up as concertgoers hold their phones with flashlights lit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So often the concert feels like a backdrop for the fans to do other things. We see them wandering the arena, buying snacks, and purchasing merchandise. Of course, this isn’t out of the ordinary, but the fact that so many concertgoers are doing this in the middle of the headliner’s set is weird. Even Riley, who is obsessed with Lady Raven, sometimes seems more focused on getting snacks than on watching the show. (No hate on snacks, but personally, when I see my favorite musician, my eyes are glued to them.)<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="77a0bf71fab48e36d609a8a83edcabbc" data-recommend-id="image://77a0bf71fab48e36d609a8a83edcabbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett and Ariel Donahue look off-camera.

At concerts, a musician’s inner circle is usually behind some sort of barrier, making it difficult to strike up a conversation, let alone convince them that you should be the one to go on stage.

Typically, famous musicians have bodyguards or entourage members with them for public events, but especially for impromptu private meetings with fans at their homes.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dead Island 2 has been on the market since April 2023, and Dambuster Studios is still hard at work introducing new content to the zombie-slaying platform. Last year, the game was released to a solid reception after being in development for more than a decade, and it quickly became one of my all-time favourite open-world zombie-themed games.</p>



<p>On October 22, Dead Island 2 will get the ‘Patch 6’ update, which will introduce New Game Plus and a brand-new horde mode called Neighbourhood Watch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>Last year, we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-neighborhood-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported exclusively on Neighborhood Watch</a>, the all-new experience that’s finally arriving in October of this year. Per our report, this new mode will see players clear out a neighbourhood and defend a safe house against waves of enemies. It’ll take place over a five-day loop, during which a ‘setup phase’ will unravel before the hordes move in.</p>



<p>As you play further through Neighborhood Watch, you’ll unlock new abilities that give you a fresh experience every time. It’ll also usher in a host of new weapons, outfits, locations, and in-game mechanics.</p>



<p>Patch 6 will also introduce New Game Plus. This will enable players to start their Dead Island 2 story from the beginning <strong>but </strong>with their existing character, which means they’ll pull through all their collected weapons and skills. </p>



<p>It’s even more rewarding, as Dambuster will add on an increased level cap and new weapons <strong>plus </strong>a tougher difficulty mode and new zombie archetypes.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 is a phenomenal and brutal game with plenty to offer – if you’ve never experienced it, now is the perfect time. Since it was released, two major expansions have been added to the game, which presents you with hours of content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/vampire-survivors-development-sounds-like-an-open-source-fueled-fever-dream<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Poncle/Future Friends.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last print issue of Game Informer shipped with a fantastic interview with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creator Luca Galante, and boy is it a doozy. Galante's given plenty of interviews in the past about his surprise hit game that birthed a sea of "survivor" games, but his chat with Game Informer tells us a little more about the tools and techniques that brought the game to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with Pao Yumol, Galante </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/vampire-survivors-developer-interview/">retold some</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nme.com/features/vampire-survivors-creator-luca-galante-talks-quitting-his-job-to-fulfil-his-promise-3153107">familiar tales</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from development—that his gambling app programming background didn't really influence the whole game's design, just the treasure chest openings, and that he he was first inspired by LEME's mobile game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Magic Survival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—but there are a few new tidbits that tell us how making the game was possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, the proliferation of open source tools and free assets are what set Galante on the journey to making his own games. Galante specifically used the HTML5 open-source game engine </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and built the basics of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with default engine assets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game's janky visuals that spiral out of control when hundreds of sprites pour onto the screen were there from the start, when he grabbed a Castlevania-themed pack of sprites. He told Game Informer that the sprites "were not getting rendered at the right size," and he fell in love with those imperfections.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They were all very chaotic [and] messy. There was a lot of green on screen, with a giant mantis and grass on the floor."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="With open-source game engines, you can do a lot with a little">With open-source game engines, you can do a lot with a little</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Galante's fire-and-forget development process apparently took off when he began designing playable characters and weapons, which is still his "favorite part" of the development process. He explained his approach to design was "mercenary," grabbing individual assets from the sprite pack and coding attack patterns on the spot, with little thought for character, feel, or consistency.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This...uh, "methodology" manifested in a strange way in 2023, when he opened the game and discovered a character Game Informer says he "didn't recognize." Sometime in development he "blacked out" (his words) and forgot he'd made the character before going to sleep.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stories of blackout in game development may conjure nervous memories of crunch and overwork for many developers, but it seems Galante perceives it as being more about his familiarity with his own toolkit. "Sometimes that comes from knowing your tools very well—your programming language, the game framework, and all of that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The story closes with the tale of Peppino, a Christmas Tree character whose ability is just standing still and letting enemies pour over him. Galante made him in tribute to a Christmas tree that he was taking down on January 7, 2022, when a friend messaged him to let him know the game's sales were exploding after YouTuber SplatterCat published a review of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Galante, he forgot to take down the tree and then decided to let it stay up forever.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there's more. Peppino's "standing still" gimmick came from Galante learning about players who took on self-imposed "no movement" challenges. Galante told Game Informer that he had an unused sprite for a pine tree still on hand and the still-standing Christmas tree in his apartment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The name Peppino in Italian means a pine tree, basically," he told the outlet. "And so my incredibly stupid brain just put all those bits together."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We would </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">normally</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> point you to Game Informer's website to read the rest of Yumol's interview with Galante, but the interview was never published online following GameStop's decision to close the outlet and wipe out its online archives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We encourage you to seek out a physical issue of Game Informer's final issue to read it, and other great stories, for yourself.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
