We stopped laughing out loud, and started laughing in our heads. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s why we need more shows like Peacock’s hilariously self-contained comedy <em>Laid</em>. </p><p>For eight 30-minute episodes, Ruby Yao (Stephanie Hsu) and her true-crime-obsessed best friend AJ (Zosia Mamet) trace every person Ruby had slept with after discovering that all of her sexual partners are dying in the order of when they had sex with her. In search of a way to stop the murders, the perpetually phenomenal Hsu tries to circumvent the curse with over-the-jeans dry humping, remembers her covid-era safe sex romp that had her and <em>Search Party</em>’s John Early trying to dirty talk through N95 masks, and tells her former throuple with Simu Liu that they could die soon.</p><p><em>Laid </em>doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does steamroll over any drama, flattening it into nothing more than soil from which humor can sprout. Ruby is taken to task by all of her ex-lovers over her inconsiderate actions, including drunkenly sleeping with AJ’s boyfriend and lying about it, and any deep self-examination she might engage in is promptly undercut as she makes a crude joke about her predicament. She’ll yell at an incompetent police officer about how much of a terrible person she is, then tell him she didn’t instinctively check to see if his partner was wearing a wedding ring because she instantly saw that he was gay. <em>Laid </em>is a laughs factory with a joke manufacturing strategy I wish other “comedies” followed. </p><p>We live in a world where an anxiety-riddled drama like <em>The Bear</em>, an existential deep dive into the psyche of a hitman like <em>Barry</em>, and an exploration into grief through the eyes of a children’s TV host like <em>Kidding</em> can all be nominated for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes. All three are spectacular shows, but the laughs are few and far between. Post-<em>Breaking Bad</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>Hollywood has become too enamored with the relatable antihero trope, to the point that it’s found its way into nearly every genre of TV. Why can’t we just have a goofball going through absurd situations in which the only real goal is to find new ways to make the audience laugh? </p><p>Luckily, we have shows like <em>Hacks</em>, <em>Abbott Elementary</em>, and, of course, <em>Laid</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>making sure we remember that even fully fleshed-out human beings can be fuckin’ hilarious all of the time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Stray Kite Studios--an indie developer that includes veterans from BioShock, Borderlands, and Age of Empires--has debuted the first look at the company's inaugural original title Wartorn. As seen in the trailer below, the game thrusts players into the lives of two elven sisters who are trying to survive long enough to reunite with their family. And they'll have to make some tough decisions along the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tt1bNPFk0U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Combat will play a major role in their journey, but it won't be the only thing that impacts their fate. Stray Kite indicated that the sisters will "confront moral dilemmas and battle external and internal threats." Luckily, they aren't powerless in this fantasy world.</p><p>"Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness," Stary Kite Studios creative director Paul Hellquist said in a statement. "We've poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains, but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us."</p><p>The studio also touted the destructible environments as well as the dynamic combat system that puts the elements of water, fire, and electricity in the hands of the players. Wartorn's roguelike progression system will offer upgrades, items, and new abilities that will carry over to each run. Players can also slow down time to keep their characters from being overwhelmed in the heat of battle.</p><p>Prior to this game, Stray Kite Studios worked with Gearbox and 2K Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure. The studio has also created minigames through Fortnite Creative.</p><p>Wartorn will be available in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Epic Game Store in Spring 2025.</p>

            <p>
As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> readies for the release of Season 2 on 28th January, developer Treyarch has shared initial details of Zombies mode's next map, The Tomb - which plunges players deep beneath the earth, down into ancient catacombs.
</p>
<p>
"As the rumours have it," Treyarch explains in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement">post on the Call of Duty website</a>, "a British archeologist by the name of Sir Archibald Fotherington-Smythe conducted an excavation at the site back in 1908 with grand expectations. Although no one can say for sure what became of him, a handful of photographs from his doomed expedition have recently surfaced..."
</p>
<p>
Picking up after the events at Citadelle des Morts - Zombies mode's third Black Ops 6 map, introduced during Season 1 - The Tomb sees Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya following Gabriel Krafft's final words to a nearby excavation site as they continue their search for the Sentinel Artifact. From there, the only way is down - deep into long-undisturbed catacombs built on an ancient burial ground, and perhaps even deeper still.

<p>
Treyarch says The Tomb has been designed to offer a similar experience to Zombies mode's Liberty Falls map, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. It's also promising "plenty" of Easter Eggs, and a reimagined Wonder Weapon inspired by the series' past. More specific gameplay details will be shared closer to The Tomb's release - but in the meantime, the studio has revealed a number of other additions coming to Zombies mode in Season 2.
</p><p>
These include a much-requested co-op pause feature which, as its name suggests, enables a party leader to pause the game during play, provided all participants are in the same party. That's on top of loadout recovery for players who rejoin a session after being kicked while AFK, plus a range of Challenge Tracker and Near Completion improvements, and the ability to set up separate HUD presets for Zombies and multiplayer modes.
</p>
<p>
According to Treyarch, Black Ops 6 players have now amassed 480m hours in Zombies mode since its launch last October, with Directed Mode - introduced a month later - having helped raise the average Main Quest completion rate from 3.38 percent to 8.23 percent. "This still means over 90 percent of people who've played Zombies haven't completed a Main Quest yet, so our mission continues," it notes, "but we're proud of these initial results, and excited to welcome so many new players into the fold with this new feature. Onward and upward!"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-review-gaming-pc-laptop-1851740112<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2023, Google partnered with different PC makers to create  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-premium-chromebook-plus-laptops-for-productivity-and-gaming-with-google-ai-built-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-premium-chromebook-plus-laptops-for-productivity-and-gaming-with-google-ai-built-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebook Plus</a></span>—a new line of its stripped-down spin on a laptop running its own OS. The idea was to offer a more powerful version of the Chromebook to those who wanted that extra oomph. And before Christmas, Google sent me a new Chromebook Plus from Acer so I could check out this device’s gaming capabilities. After a few weeks with it, I’m happy to report that this is a solid laptop that I might buy in the future. But it’s not a great way to play most games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Acer 516 GE is the specific <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebook Plus</a></span> I was sent to review. And before I leap into my issues with streaming on it, I should clarify that the device itself is sleek, modern, has a solid battery life, and never gave me any technical issues. Watching videos, writing, and surfing the web using the Acer Chromebook Plus was a very enjoyable experience. </p><p>In the past, I’ve used Chromebooks and didn’t enjoy it. The stripped-down ChromeOS-powered laptops have been around for a decade or so now, but whenever I touched one, I always walked away disappointed by the lack of performance and function. </p><p>Now, in 2025, as more apps are web-based and mobile hardware has become incredibly fast, using a Chromebook isn’t painful. In fact, while using the Acer 516 GE I would forget it was a Chromebook, as many things I do every day on a computer—check my email, chat with co-workers, read news, and write stories—are done through a browser anyway. As a result, I never had a problem using the Acer 516 GE. Well, until I tried to play games. </p><figure id="" data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-recommend-id="image://12fed492be1ba3a93a07c1d4adb1f9c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2900" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-plus-516-ge-cbg516-2h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">516 GE Chromebook Plus</a></span> is marketed heavily as a gamer-focused device. Google sent it to me, a writer at <em>Kotaku</em>, because its supposedly a gamer-friendly device. But if you know anything about ChomeOS and Chromebooks, you know that these things can’t play high-end games. The solution? The power of the cloud.</p><p>That’s the big selling point of the 516 GE. You don’t have to download games or worry about tech requirements. Just log into your preferred game streaming service and play stuff like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em>Fortnite </em>instantly. And maybe, in another five years, this promise will become a reality, but for now streaming games is still a bad way to play stuff. </p><p>I tried <em>Fortnite, Cyberpunk 2077, </em>and <em>Gears 5</em> using different methods including Game Pass, Nvidia Geforce Now, and Amazon Luna. And while some were better than others, none of them matched the experience of playing a game natively on a device like a console or PC. </p><figure id="" data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Acer / Google</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-recommend-id="image://afe4301ec93c83e2acd32ccf9b069fd3" data-format="png" data-width="1195" data-height="682" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now, you can install Steam on the 516 GE (it has a speical built-in feature to allow this) and using what I assume is Proton, I was able to play some 2D games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Vampire</em> <em>Survivors </em>and <em>Balatro</em></a></span><em> </em>just fine on the 516 GE. But that’s not impressive in a world where my phone can do that, too. No, the big selling point of this device is being able to play high-end, AAA video games on the go with no downloading and without having to shell out thousands of dollars on a dedicated gaming laptop.</p><p>Sadly, in 2025, even with Google Fiber internet (which I have), the 516 GE can’t remove the lag, choppiness, and visual artifacts that you encounter when streaming games. </p><p>So, if you are looking for a powerful Chromebook that can play some basic 2D games and retro stuff (I was able to get <em>Turok </em>running on it without any issues) then the 516 GE is worth checking out. Just don’t expect it and its game-streaming capabilities to replace your Switch, Steam Deck, or PS5 anytime soon. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/">Madden NFL</a> is touted as having new and exciting presentation elements with every new installment in the series. These elements, such as commentary, field-level camera work, and halftime shows, are inconsistent at best and tend to leave a lot to be desired, especially when you compare them to the same aspects of games like NBA 2K and MLB The Show. But the latest presentation gaffe in Madden 25 feels like a strangely unforced error.</p><p dir="ltr">In the most recent patch, the EA Orlando team introduced the Team Pass, a new battle pass-like cosmetic rewards tree that offers both free and paid unlockables that amount to player banner customization options. You can unlock things like profile pictures, backgrounds, and borders, just like you can in Call of Duty or many other games. These cosmetics are all centered around one particular team of a player's choosing and are meant to be proudly displayed in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">In practice, this means the scorebug in any game replaces the logo of the team you're playing as with imagery based on the team you chose in the Team Pass. This is a reasonably innocuous feature for game modes like the arcadey Superstar Showdown and the fantasy-sports-inspired Ultimate Team (MUT). However, forcing this cosmetic change in Franchise mode quickly becomes an eyesore given players are tied to the hip with one particular team--and not necessarily the same team as that in their Team Pass--and are much more likely to be interested in simulating the product they see on TV.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428326" data-ratio="0.51203007518797" data-width="1330" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428326"></a><figcaption>Sit down; the Atlanta Jets and New Orleans Rob Lowes game is on. (Image credit: CouchCoach16 on Twitch)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can't change your chosen team once you've opted into the Team Pass, though the game suggests a new Team Pass will be sold in a few months during the next live-service season. The Team Pass seems built on the assumption that players will choose their favorite team and that it will be the same team they tend to use in various game modes. It's arguably a fair assumption some of the time, but Franchise is a mode in which players often purposely take on a team other than the one close to their heart.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe they want a rebuilding project, or they want to create a custom team in a new city with a new name and uniforms, or maybe, like in the case of my online league, there are 32 players and few of us will get our favorite team. My league plays year-round, switching to the latest Madden every August. Our teams become our identity. To have an unrelated team tied to our long-term persona is a jarring feature the moment you first see it on the screen. Why would I want a team other than the one I'm controlling and the one I'm facing to be featured on the scorebug?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428329" data-ratio="0.22666666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428329"></a><figcaption>A closer look at the strange new presentation decision by the Madden team. Previously, you'd see Falcons and Saints logos here. Now, neither is visible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the worst case, the scorebug now features up to four teams: the two teams playing each other, identified by their three-letter abbreviation, and as many as two more teams that have overtaken the team logo spaces and replaced them with potentially several extravagant cosmetics. I don't know how it got through testing. It's kind of like if the scorebug's remaining timeout nodes were changed to various emojis. Can I figure it out soon enough? Yeah, sure. But does it improve anything? Does it make sense? Does it look nice, the way cosmetic options for sale within a game should? Nope. Nobody looked at a game between the Steelers and Ravens in which the scorebug suggests--in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect" rel="nofollow ">Stroop test</a> fashion--it's actually the Seahawks and Patriots and thought something was wrong?</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly perplexing is what happens if you opt out of the Team Pass entirely. The game then applies a default logo to your profile, the NFL shield, so you end up looking like the NFL franchise <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2020/1/19/21073367/rob-lowe-nfl-hat-nfc-championship-packers-49ers" rel="nofollow ">embodiment of Rob Lowe</a>, giving games a strange one-team-versus-the-league aesthetic at a glance. This is easier to read than the possibly very busy illustrations the Team Pass may grant you, but it still replaces a sensible team-specific logo with the default NFL logo as a means of getting you to care about the Team Pass. It's the equivalent of NBA 2K's annual bland, brown shirt for all new create-a-players filtering into the game. It's purposely unappealing to inspire you to spend money on something nicer. But in this case, the nicer option isn't so nice.</p><p dir="ltr">There are bigger problems in the world. Heck, there are even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/">bigger problems in the Madden world</a>. I haven't lost sight of that. But so often, better, more consistent sports sims sweat the small stuff to such an appreciable degree that it's exciting to see what those games will roll out with each new game. In the case of Madden, I have been conditioned to merely hope the game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/"> doesn't permanently erase my hundreds of hours of Franchise saved data</a> or that I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-mercifully-lets-players-turn-off-one-of-the-series-worst-features/1100-6514909/">eventually turn off an unbalanced mechanic</a> that never improved across several iterations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428328"></a><figcaption>To each their own, but even without the scorebug problem, it's hard to rationalize why they felt they needed three Patriot logos on this one profile pic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not interested in buying the Team Pass, but I acknowledge that it could be fun and harmless for a portion of the massive community to chase these rewards. Every live-service game has a mandate to be what I like to call "a little more Fortnite." Customization and cosmetic brags like a rare skin or profile picture inspire tons of spending and countless hours played. Maybe Madden will enjoy a similar outcome with its first Team Pass. But in a mode like online Franchise, in which players already painstakingly tweak the game's sliders, rules, and behaviors to cover up some of the inherited blemishes the series drops in our laps, these MUT-like touches just get in the way of what is often already a head-scratching experience.</p><p dir="ltr">My hope for this new cosmetic overhaul is that the EA Orlando team will find another place for us to show off our player banners--a non-obstructive, non-headache-inducing place. Additional revenue streams are unavoidable in many games today, especially those operating like a live service such as Madden, so I get that this stuff is here to stay, but does it have to stay in my way?</p>

Take-Two might not need the extra money, but raising the price of<em> GTA VI</em> could give cover to other companies to raise their prices as well. The increasingly hollowed-out middle ground could go from charging $40 and $50 to $60 and $70, so the reasoning goes. Then again, in the current zero-sum environment, raising the cap could also just drive even more money away from smaller companies and lesser-known franchises. </p><figure id="" data-id="bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-recommend-id="image://bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-format="png" data-width="1192" data-height="848" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows how much of the gaming market is dominated by the top franchises.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t the first time someone’s brought up the idea of <em>GTA VI </em>potentially breaking the current $70 price barrier. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925">asked about it on investor calls in the past</a></span> and responds by saying the company always wants to overdeliver in terms of quality and value. That noncommittal response certainly doesn’t close the door to <em>GTA VI </em>being $80 or even $100, and Take-Two was one of the first companies to push existing games into $70 territory with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Before that, premium boxed games had been $60 since the launch of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remaining stagnant for roughly 15 years</a></span> even while most other things around them got more expensive, including development budgets. When <em>GTA 3</em> came to PS2 back in 2001, it was $50. If it were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjusted for inflation</a></span>, it would cost $90 today. And in fact many big blockbusters, like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, already have $100 versions for those players who want limited-edition skins, premium battle passes, extra in-game items, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">and early access to play ahead of the official launch</a></span> (the ultimate edition of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is even more at $110). </p><p>In his analysis, Ball points to a number of reasons why companies are so hesitant to raise game prices, or at least now use a one-size-fits-all approach to selecting them. The mere fact that game prices have historically not changed much has reinforced how “sticky” they are and leads to outsized player scrutiny any time price hikes are discussed. Other factors are competition from the rise of free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Genshin Impact</em> and the desire to reach as big a player-base as possible for battle passes, DLC, and other paid add-ons down the road. Plus it’s no secret how many people are already trained to wait just a few months for major discounts on everything but the best-selling games. </p><p>Nintendo recently showed that price hikes aren’t the end of the world when done smartly. It charged an extra $10 for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> despite still being on the same hardware as the $60 <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The game still went on to sell over 20 million copies and it also didn’t mean that <em>Pikmin 4</em> was all of a sudden going to cost $70 too (though it certainly would have still been worth it). <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was only $60 on PC, but could have been another obvious contender for an $80 or even $100 game.</p><p>“I don’t love the artificiality of pricing structures post retail,” Larian Studios head of publishing, Michael Douse, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote online last year</a></span>. “Use the inflated base price to upsell a subscription, and use vague content promises to inflate ultimate editions to make the base price look better. It all seems a bit dangerous &amp; disconnected from the community. I think a game should be priced accordingly with its quality, breadth &amp; depth. I’m not against higher prices, but this arbitrary uniformity just doesn’t make sense to me. It feels so unserious.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian is celebrating 100 million mod downloads by giving the game's undead hero Withers some big naturals. The developer has added the <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/withersbignaturals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Withers Big Naturals" mod</a> by creator MaybeeAdam to its official mod list, meaning console players can give their Withers a set of big boobs, if they feel so inclined. The mod is a reference to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-in-gods-name-is-gandalf-big-naturals-the-surreal-photoshop-lotr-meme-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Gandalf Big Naturals" meme </a>that originated on Tumblr in 2021.</p><p>Larian announced the addition, and the number of mod downloads, with a social media post featuring a picture of Withers with the text "100 million mod downloads." Both the zeros in 100 million have been photoshopped over Withers' chest. The post is captioned, "you are modding naturals."</p><p>In October 2024, Larian announced players had downloaded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">50 million mods</a>. 100,000 of those downloads were to rename Withers to "Bone Daddy." That was just over two months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes/2900-5753/" data-ref-id="2900-5753"> a patch added official mod support</a> to the game on PC and console.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Baldur's Gate 3's final big patch</a> will bring 12 new subclasses, cross-play, and a photo mode. You can<a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> register to preview the patch in a stress test</a>. Larian is already focusing on a mysterious new project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. If you are looking to mod the game yourself, you can start with GameSpot's list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">the best mods for Baldur's Gate 3</a>. Most of them should be compatible with any aesthetic changes to Withers you want to make.</p>

Funding is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cheap-money-and-bad-bets-how-the-games-industry-turned-pandemic-success-into-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scarce</a>. Companies are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-10/why-so-many-video-games-cost-so-much-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNjUzMjA0NywiZXhwIjoxNzM3MTM2ODQ3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUFZXTzlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qopDytLFnUY5oOkR9UB2NLBxokJ4yJH0HqzkZP5_dvw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rife with mismanagement</a>. If a big game flops, execs often ensure that it <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes entire studios with it</a>. But perhaps, some observers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffwebb.tech/post/3lcdsucykp22j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have suggested</a>, this is merely a course correction. Last year was <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a goldmine of breakout indie hits</a> like <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Manor Lords</em>, <em>Palworld</em>,<em> Animal Well</em>, and <em>1000xResist</em>; maybe it’s time for the meek to inherit the industry. Problem is, indies need money, too – a lot more than you might think. On the latest episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/you-are-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Are Error</a>, we discuss that not-so-little stumbling block and how one of gaming’s foundational myths, the solo indie dev, helped get us here.</p><p>We’ve arrived at a point in time when, more so than ever, “indie” means a lot of different things to different people. As it turns out, many games players refer to as “indie” now cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to make. And as big companies struggle to find funding, it’s not like small developers are suddenly flush with cash. Where does this disconnect come from? Why do so many fans – knowledgeable and engaged ones, no less – still view indies as solo operations running on passion, a pocketful of pennies, and a dream? And did independent game development ever truly work that way? Or were we all swindled by the glitz and glamor of <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162580/indie-game-the-movie-rewatch-fez-braid-super-meat-boy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game: The Movie</a></em> back in 2012?</p><p>My guest today is Mike Bithell, head of Bithell Games, the studio that brought us early indie hits like <em>Thomas Was Alone</em>, as well as recent, more mainstream fare like <em>John Wick Hex</em> and <em>Tron: Identity</em>. In many senses, he’s one of the original “solo” indie devs, even as he now runs a whole studio and tries to educate people on the time, resources, and manpower it takes to make smaller commercial games these days. In selecting Mike as the focal point of this episode, I was hoping he’d be down to take a look in the mirror and grapple with potentially pernicious elements of his legacy. And he was!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can hear us talk about all that and more on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7w7V296dt8HCoDryWiofI4?si=f79446b5647c44bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/you-are-error/id1782231480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you enjoy the show, please consider leaving a review so that Aftermath can amass <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the necessary resources to sustain itself</a> – which is still a fraction of what you’d need to fund many modern indie games.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a couple excerpts from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> I think there is still a perception that indie games are independently funded, and I think that’s a reasonable expectation given where indie comes from and the word “indie” itself. But if you look at most of the indie games the average player has heard of, they’re perhaps not completely independently funded by the development team that’s making them, and I think that’s probably the root of it: We’re more dependent on the industry at large than the average player probably realizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Let’s dig into that. I saw some conversation online where people were discussing the amount that it costs to make an indie game these days, which I think if you’re pulling your perception of how indie games are made from an earlier time, that [cost] might have changed. I saw Cara Ellison, who does writing for video games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/caraellison.bsky.social/post/3lcdz5srg522t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a> that these days it can be $500,000-$1 million. When you hear the word “indie,” you probably don’t think $1 million. But does that seem accurate to you based on your own experiences or observations?</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> I agree with Cara on a lot of things, but I would say it’s broader potentially than even she’s laying out there. Obviously there’s indie games that cost nothing except the time of the person who’s making them; that still exists. But then on the upper end of things, I would say it can go into the multiple millions. We’ve certainly worked on games that are multiple millions of dollars just in development costs. If you’ve got a group of people coming together for a game, and it’s a sizable team, then that’s gonna cost [a lot].&nbsp;</p><p>I think that’s another aspect of this that people maybe don’t fully understand: The most expensive thing in games, rightly so, is people. It’s the salaries of the people who gather to make the game. So if you just do some math yourself: If there’s 10, 15, 20 people on that kind of money for X number of years, those numbers suddenly come to bear. A million dollars is a lot of money on an individual level, but in sustaining the salaries of a group of people, it’s actually not a lot of money over those timelines and at that sort of scale.</p><p>I think indie – and this is definitely true of conversations I’ve seen around filmmaking as well – because indie is so intrinsically linked to this idea of the hobbyist, or the person working on their own, the solo developer, it can create this sense that you fund it in the same way as you’d fund a hobby. If you want to make games as a hobby, you’d have to buy an OK computer, basically. Or you’ve already got one. And then you just invest your time in it. There’s a big jump from there to a professionalized kind of development process.&nbsp;</p><p>We kind of blur that, and I think arguably, indies, we’ve done well from intentionally blurring that a little. There’s that kind of plucky underdog story. I remember when my first game started, lots of thinkpieces were like “Sell your narrative. Sell the story of you. Sell that heroic underdog story – the little dev that could.” We all kind of framed ourselves in that way because that’s what the audience wanted from a satisfying story point of view. It would be hypocritical to be offended that they then come to the assumption that that was a completely honest depiction of how games are made.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It strikes me that this notion of the solo indie dev as kind of a formative myth for the video game industry – sort of the default of how a lot of people perceive indies – [gained traction with <em>Indie Game: The Movie</em>]. It focused on these individuals as a way of at the time humanizing developers, which I think was useful because there wasn’t as much of that back then. But it also created this archetype. That movie didn’t come out of thin air, though. It’s not like somebody creates a documentary and thinks “OK, I’m gonna craft this entire narrative from nothing.” Where did the seeds of it come from? What did [the documentarians] see that made them think “This is the story we’ve got to tell?”</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> To an extent, it was true. I’m a big believer that no work can exist because of one person. Even if you’re on your own, you still have teachers, you still have peers, you still have a community. But back then, a lot of those games were made if not by solo devs, then maybe one person who was focused and fixated on it and satellite people who would help out. <em>Thomas Was Alone</em> was me in terms of the core of it, and then I had Dave [Housden], the composer, and Danny [Wallace], who voiced the narrator in it, and that was it.&nbsp;</p><p>On a basic level, I think it’s true. It was also good marketing. From a storytelling point of view, we got to do <em>Rocky</em>, basically. We got to sell ourselves as these individuals fighting the system, and we were encouraged to do that by the games journalism of the time as well. They were good stories, for sure, and fair enough.&nbsp;</p><p>I think what I’ve certainly tried to do– despite having a company called Bithell Games, which I’m very aware of; at the time, it was just me and my mate Daz [Watford] in the company, and we were talking about names for the company, and he was like “I would like to coast on your name if I could.” He was like “You’re the one they’ve heard of. Can we just call it after you?” I wish I hadn’t listened to him, because once you’re 20 people, it’s so embarrassing to introduce yourself as “Mike Bithell, the owner of Bithell Games.” It’s awful.</p><p>But yeah, I think what I try and do is always emphasize the group. Whenever I do interviews or I’m talking like this, I will always mention the team as much as I can. But people like simple stories, and there is always gonna be a chunk of the audience who plays our games that think of them as the sole expression of me. I even started, 15 years ago now, putting opening title sequences on our games primarily so I could just have the names of people working on the game come up before you even start – and even that didn’t really push through too much.</p><p>So we do what we can. I think it’s true, though, of most things – definitely of music. Movies, we think of in terms of [for example] Spielberg. We don’t think about the enormous number of people [who contributed]. And often it’s a good shorthand, because a director, say, may work with the same editor, the same this, the same that every film, so it becomes a shorthand. Literally it happened to me with a friend the other day. We were talking about <em>Tron: Catalyst</em>; we’d released some screenshots, and they were saying “It looks like a real Mike Bithell game.” And it’s like, it looks like a Daz Watford game. He’s been doing my art for a decade now. That’s the distinction. That’s the kind of stuff you try to correct for.</p><p>But ultimately, I think it’s a good shorthand for marketing. It’s a good shorthand to protect the team. If one of our games is badly received, I want to be the lightning rod for that. I don’t want the team to be getting angry messages. It’s always a balancing act. It’s incredibly embarrassing to be perceived as egotistical, so I’m terrified by that at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, I think you’re absolutely right: This does play into the conversation. People don’t think about the team with any game, and most devs nowadays – definitely my generation of indie devs – are making games at this kind of scale. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty [people]. There are new generations coming up that are doing the solo dev thing, often successfully. But what’s interesting there and what I’m finding interesting in the discussion surrounding that generation is, that generation’s using a lot more things like asset packs and resources that have been built by other people and sold to them – and they should take advantage of anything that’s available to them. So technically they’re not solo. They’re using assets made by other people, and there’s all of those hands that have touched that game.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a weird one. Unless you’re making a game about rectangles, you’re probably not a solo dev. There’s probably someone else who’s had an impact. There are exceptions to that rule, but it’s much rarer than the average person believes it to be.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024"><h3>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024</h3></a><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal"><h3>You Can’t Rush Christmas</h3></a><p>A thing is announced when it's announced</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NetEase has announced that the Advanced Suit 2.0 is coming to Marvel Rivals to celebrate the PC launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The company posted a reveal on Twitter earlier today, stating that the suit will be available for Spider-Man from January 30.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friendly-neighbourhood-spider-man">Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter (X), NetEase wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Take the first look at Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (2023) in Marvel Rivals, the Advanced Suit 2.0 blends Otto Octavius’s science with Peter Parker’s genius. Crafted for the toughest battles, it symbolizes Spider-Man’s true grit as a hero.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the reveal image used to showcase the Advanced Suit 2.0 in Marvel Rivals:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Spider-Man 2 was released in 2023 to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and while Insomniac neglected to follow up with any major expansions, the game has remained popular since. On January 30, the web-slinging hero title will land on PC via Steam.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been a boon for NetEase since being released in December 2024. It has pulled in tens of millions of players and has become one of the best hero shooters to emerge in recent years. It’s challenging Overwatch in the genre and will be a thorn in the side of Valve’s Deadlock.</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals, Spider-Man is one of the most challenging Duelists. He has a five-star difficulty rating and relies on unparalleled acrobatic abilities to dominate the playing field.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of Spider-Man 2, you’ll want to snag the Advanced Suit 2.0 when it appears in Marvel Rivals on January 30.</p>

<p>In a recent update posted on Steam, it was revealed that Fortune’s Run, a retro sci-fi indie shooter, will have all development activity put on hold for three years. This is because the sole developer, ‘Dizzie’, will be serving a 36-month prison sentence, which was handed down as a result of the dev living ‘a very different life’ before they started working on Fortune’s Run.</p>



<p>As of today, Fortune’s Run boasts a ‘Very Positive’ rating on Steam, where it has existed since September 2023.</p>

<h2 id="h-it-s-unclear-what-will-happen">‘It’s Unclear What Will Happen’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on Valve’s PC platform, Steam, the sole developer of Fortune’s Run explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been sentenced to prison for the next 3 years. It’s a long story, but I’ve lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn’t living very well. My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month. </p>



<p>It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post went on to explain that Fortune’s Run ‘sold okay’ and that once Dizzie is released from prison, they’ll hopefully be back on their feet and will return to the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I’m never going to stop making games. I’d like to finish this one, but I don’t know what will happen. I’m going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news was followed up by a couple more posts explaining some updates and tweaks being made to the game – which will likely be the final changes Fortune’s Run will see for quite some time.</p>

                <p>Esteemed Polish development studio CD Projekt Red has a number of projects in development, including a remake of the 2007 original The Witcher game.

CD Projekt Red boss Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience" feels "just as big, if not bigger" than when the studio first released the original game in 2007.</p><p>The game is based on Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, taking place in a medieval fantasy world and telling the story of the monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia and his travels throughout a dangerous world filled with human and fantastical enemies alike. It's expected the remake will tell the same story.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</h2><p>The Witcher remake is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which is the newest version of the engine.

CD Projekt boss Adam Badowski sung the studio's praises, saying the team knows the source material well and understand that fans have been looking forward to a remake for some time. A number of Fool's Theory staffers previously worked at CD Projekt on the original Witcher game. CD Projekt Red is providing "full creative supervision."</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</h2><p>A key difference between the original Witcher and the remake is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-fully-open-world-unlike-the-original/1100-6509525/" data-ref-id="1100-6509525">the remake will be fully open-world</a>. Not only was the first Witcher game presented in a more linear fashion, the sequel, Assassins of Kings, was as well. These games featured large open zones players could explore. However, progressing the story past certain key points would move players to a new zone, closing off the previous area entirely. The series didn't go fully open world until 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>According to Jakub Rokosz, who heads up the remake's developer, Fool's Theory, parts of The Witcher that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-remove-simply-bad-and-outdated-elements/1100-6520729/" data-ref-id="1100-6520729">outdated or are "simply bad" will be removed.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-remake-dev-pledges-to-remove-the-parts-that-are-simply-bad-and-i-think-i-know-whats-first-on-the-chopping-block/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Rokosz said that "first and foremost, we need an honest, down-to-earth analysis of which parts are simply bad, outdated, and need to be remade," but these changes will be done while "highlighting the parts that are great, should be retained, or are direct key pillars that can't be discarded" for the remake.</p><p>Some fans have already begun predicting which elements will be sent to the chopping block. Obvious changes include the dated combat and traversal systems, while online, fans are speculating that Geralt's infamous "Romance Cards" won't be included in the remake either.</p>

And now, dozens of movies later, a new report claims that one of the villains from that very first<em> Iron Man</em> film, Raza, is returning in a new MCU TV show. Are you excited? Do you even remember Raza? Well, it doesn’t matter; he’s back, baby! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/01/faran-tahir-marvel-vision-series-disney-plus-1236257063/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/faran-tahir-marvel-vision-series-disney-plus-1236257063/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On January 14, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that its sources had confirmed that actor Faran Tahir was set to appear in the upcoming Paul Bettany-led <em>Vision Quest</em> series. Tahir played Raza, the terrorist leader in charge of the group responsible for kidnapping and injuring Tony Stark. According to the outlet, Tahir is returning specifically to reprise his role as Raza. </p><p>Now if you do remember his role as Raza in <em>Iron Man</em>, then you might remember that in the movie he uh...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Raza_Hamidmi_al-Wazar#Obadiah_Stane's_Betrayal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Raza_Hamidmi_al-Wazar#Obadiah_Stane's_Betrayal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died</a></span>. I won’t reveal specifics in case you haven’t seen<em> Iron Man</em> and want to watch it, but yeah, he’s dead. But death rarely stops characters in comic books or superhero movies from returning. Perhaps he’s from a different universe or he didn’t actually die or he’s a clone.

<p>Activision has revealed its new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies map that will launch at the start of Season 2. The new map is called The Tomb, and will release for all Zombies players on January 28.</p>



<p>“After surviving the horrific events at Citadelle des Morts, Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya follow Gabriel Krafft’s final words to a nearby excavation site to secure the Sentinel Artifact,” the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post reads</a>. “Built on the remains of ancient burial grounds with suspected origins dating back to 2500 B.C.E., these catacombs went undisturbed for centuries until the early 1900s… and what lies beneath may run deeper than anyone ever imagined.”</p>



<p>Developer Treyarch says that The Tomb was designed to give players an experience similar to that of Liberty Falls. The map has “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”. There will also be Easter Eggs scattered throughout the map along with a “reimagined Wonder Weapon” that is inspired by the past.</p>



<p>“As a reminder, every Zombies map in&nbsp;Black Ops 6&nbsp;is an original location built from the ground-up for the mode… but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy a wink and a nod here and there,” they said. “On that note, we’re going for something a little more evocative with our Pack-a-Punch camos this time around – and what if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?”</p>



<p>In addition to the new map, Zombies will be getting a number of updates with the launch of Season 2. Those updates include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Challenge Tracking &amp; Near Completion</li>



<li>Co-op Pausing</li>



<li>AFK Kick Loadout Recovery</li>



<li>Separate HUD presets for Zombies and Multiplayer.</li>
</ul>



<p>More details on The Tomb and what else is coming to Zombies will be revealed in the upcoming Season 2 reveal blog.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gi-joe-battle-for-the-arctic-circle-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For children of the '80s, few rivalries are as nostalgic as the one between G.I. Joe and Cobra, with their high-tech vehicles, creative codenames, and the red and blue lasers their weapons shot. For longtime board game players, the Axis &amp; Allies series of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> may hold a similar nostalgia with its large amounts of miniatures, its emphasis on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>, and tense <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice rolls</a>, all set among the height of World War II. Now under the care of Renegade Game Studios, Axis &amp; Allies are letting players experience the confrontations between the Joes and Cobra in the new G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic (minus the colorful lasers, unfortunately).</p><div catalogid="dd241838-99b5-4b20-adc7-ccc3128f3649" id="214115"><div id="214115" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>G.I. Joe: Battle for The Arctic Circle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle for the Arctic Circle puts up to four players in the boots of either G.I. Joe (playing as Keelhaul and Snow Job) or Cobra (as Destro and Cobra Commander) in a battle to control the North Pole, as both sides vie for control of points around the map and establish their hold on the Arctic Circle. From the moment you open the box, it’s clear that the goal of this game is to give the younger and more inexperienced audience a fun and interesting on-ramp to the wider world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review">Axis &amp; Allies</a> offerings, and I think the team at Renegade Game Studios succeeds.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battle for the Arctic Circle is a far less imposing beast for new players to tackle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Popping off the box lid, I was greeted with the familiar small plastic miniatures and the other usual accouterments of an A&amp;A title, just with a G.I. Joe flair. For fans who have played previous versions of Axis &amp; Allies, you will feel right at home here. Turns are still broken up the same way – you buy new units at the beginning of your turn, have your separate combat move and non-combat move phases, and battles with their attacker vs. defender rolls are all still here – but everything is just a bit more condensed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The number of miniatures is rather small, meaning players won’t need to contend with managing massive armies around the map or rolling for giant battles. With a smaller map, you won’t be earning large amounts of Reinforcement Points (Arctic Circle’s equivalent of IPCs in other A&amp;A games) to buy more units, and along with other subtle tweaks, Battle for the Arctic Circle is a far less imposing beast for new players to tackle. That said, this game does have some entirely unique mechanics and tweaks that also set it apart, some of which I enjoyed more than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a first for the A&amp;A series, Battle for the Arctic Circle abandons the real-world geographical boundaries separating areas and uses hexes, a decision that works out really well. I appreciate the real-world borders in the previous games from an immersion sense, but they are also one of the biggest issues I have with the other editions, where everything can just start feeling cramped – an issue I was happy to say I didn't encounter here. While this is also due in part to having fewer units to contend with overall, there is no denying that the larger, uniform hex spaces played a role too. I wouldn't complain if Renegade adopts this method in future games as well (something more likely to happen in future spin-off games like Battle for the Arctic Circle than mainline games, to be fair).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition unique to this G.I. Joe variant of A&amp;A comes in the form of the diabolic “Weather Dominator” device that the Cobra forces have access to on their turns. This dastardly piece of machinery, for the cost of a single RP, can turn a single non-land-only hex into an ice-covered tile that can be traversed by land units. This is a neat feature, and it proves to be incredibly important to use as Cobra to try to quickly capture nearby victory point tiles. Cobra starts with a significantly lower amount of RP to spend each turn, so using the Dominator to score some early points is a must. I really like the concept of it as well; a weather-controlling device being used by the bad guys is a quintessential ’80s cartoon story trope, and I’m here for it. To keep things fair, the Joes can use their cruiser ships to try and break up the ice, which can lead to some rather unfortunate situations where Cobra units are stranded in enemy territory without backup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest change are the unique commander powers that each player gets. While there are fewer armies to take command of in this game (only four as opposed to the more common five or six armies in the mainline A&amp;A games), each commander has a special ability that can be triggered if the correct conditions are met. Once a turn after damage is assigned, for example, Cobra Commander can sacrifice his own units to deal additional hits to the enemy (yes, Cobra Commander has kamikaze units). Snow Job's commander power grants their land units an additional space of movement during their non-combat movement phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In principle, I enjoy these unique powers, but I also found them not to all be created equally, with the Joes' powers being far more usable than Cobra’s – especially Destro’s. In Destro’s case, he gains a bonus whenever he attacks a Joe-controlled tile that contains six or more units, a scenario I perhaps encountered only once or twice during all my plays of the game. Had the ability applied when he was defending as well, it would be far more reliable or impactful. However, considering Destro has to attack to gain the bonus, it made the ability rarely used, which made playing as Destro less exciting than the others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I like the idea of the commanders having special abilities, adding a slight asymmetrical component, but the balancing of the skills currently on offer felt lacking. I wish that each side had additional commanders to choose from, with teams being able to pick only two to use. Regardlessy, the whole thing is a neat idea and a fun mix-up within the A&amp;A system that I would like to see carried over into future spin-off titles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXvNm?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjXV4?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Target</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXb4G?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/avXmx2?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Hasbro Pulse</strong></a><strong></strong></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/akRW76?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Renegade Store</strong></a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2025 6:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Battle for the Arctic Circle does a commendable job of presenting the systems of Axis &amp; Allies in a way that will be far more approachable for younger, new players while also giving those individuals a great on-ramp to the larger A&amp;A series. It also provides an option for those intrigued by the longtime war game franchise but turned off by the subject matter, giving them a solid war game without the historical complications. In both cases, I think GI Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle is a fun game to add to your collection. 

That said, outside of pure nostalgia for the Joes, I don't think there is much here for longtime A&amp;A players or for board game hobbyists looking for a deep war game that doesn’t necessarily fit into those cases mentioned above. For that group, I'd recommend either Axis &amp; Allies 1941 as an excellent jumping-in point or the Anniversary Edition for a great all-day wargaming affair. Regardless, while G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle may not be for me, I appreciate the value it offers new and younger players to get their first taste of this series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every console launch is a pivotal moment for a company, but that's especially true for Nintendo. The first Switch proved to be a remarkable rebound from the disastrous Wii U, becoming one of the best-selling video game consoles in history over the last eight years.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, Nintendo is undoubtedly facing a lot of pressure to maintain this momentum with its next console. And while it's tempting to compare this transition with the move from Wii to Wii U, the company's current situation more closely resembles the position it was in as it prepared to launch the 3DS--itself the successor to a hugely successful and influential system.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, 14 years ago this week, Nintendo hosted a media event in New York detailing its launch plans for the 3DS. Though the company had publicly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gut-reactions-nintendo-3ds-e3-2010/1100-6266572/">unveiled the handheld a few months prior at E3 2010</a>, it withheld some key details--including the system's release date, price, and launch lineup--until this January event. In hindsight, however, the reveal offered a glimpse at a rough road ahead for the platform--missteps that Nintendo will want to avoid repeating when it finally launches the Switch 2.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Meager Launch Lineup</h3><p dir="ltr">The first indication of trouble could be gleaned from the system's launch lineup. Although Nintendo had announced some exciting titles for the 3DS at E3--including a remake of the beloved Ocarina of Time, new entries in the Animal Crossing and Mario Kart franchises, and a long-awaited Kid Icarus revival--none of these would be available on day one. In fact, most would not arrive until several months after the system launched.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Nintendo pushed the 3DS out to market alongside a handful of amusing but slight built-in applications like Face Raiders, as well as three minor titles: Nintendogs + Cats, Pilotwings Resort, and submarine sim Steel Diver. Without a marquee first-party release to accompany the system, it fell to third parties to fill in the gap. Their offerings, however, were not much more enticing, with a port of the years-old Street Fighter IV garnering the most attention.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, the handheld struggled to attract an audience right from the outset. As novel as the 3DS hardware itself was, the system hit the market without a true "must-have" game to convince players to upgrade, and many ended up waiting before finally purchasing one--a situation Nintendo will no doubt want to avoid repeating when it's finally ready to launch the Switch 2.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="37255568" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

dir="ltr">Price</h3><p dir="ltr">Another crucial miscalculation on Nintendo's part was the system's price tag. By 2011, the final iteration of the Nintendo DS line, the DSi XL, was on the market for $170. Given the way Nintendo historically priced its handhelds, most industry watchers expected the 3DS to launch in the vicinity of $200. However, the final price would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-3ds-and-historical-handheld-pricing/1100-6286318/">much higher</a>. Nintendo surprised many when it announced the 3DS would retail for $250--$80 more than the DSi XL.</p><p dir="ltr">Without experiencing the 3DS in person, it was difficult for consumers to square the steep price tag. The system's defining feature--glasses-free stereoscopic 3D effects--could not be adequately conveyed to prospective buyers without getting the handheld into their hands and having them witness it for themselves (and even then, the feature’s novelty was arguably not as enticing as Nintendo hoped and would eventually be phased out in later iterations of the platform). Moreover, the early launch games, while a clear step up from the DS in terms of graphical fidelity, were not exactly visual showpieces for the handheld, making it difficult for Nintendo to justify the system's price to consumers.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Missing Features</h3><p dir="ltr">The final warning sign from the press event was the 3DS's features--or lack thereof. Although the system was poised to launch in March, its digital storefront, the Nintendo eShop, would not go live until June 2011: three full months later. Moreover, though Nintendo had touted the system's ability to play 3D movies back at E3, it had no further news to share about this feature during the January press event, which gave the impression the company was rushing the handheld out to market before it was ready.</p><p dir="ltr">Taken together, these three missteps set the 3DS on a rocky path, and the system limped out of the gate when it launched that March. Sales were so worrying that Nintendo took the unprecedented step of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-slashes-3ds-prices/1100-6325850/">slashing the system's price</a> by an eye-popping $80 USD in July, less than six months into its lifetime. (To further illustrate just how shocking this move was, the Nintendo Switch still has yet to receive an official price cut, nearly eight years into its life.) As a make-good to early adopters who did pony up the original asking price, the company also distributed an unexpectedly generous gift as part of an “<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-more-3ds-ambassador-games-named/1100-6331880/">Ambassador Program</a>”: 20 free NES and Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games.</p><p dir="ltr">This drastic course-correction had the intended effect, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/price-cut-saves-3ds-4-million-sold-in-u-s-in-2011/">3DS sales rebounded</a>. By the time Nintendo stopped supporting the platform in 2019, the entire 3DS line had sold almost 76 million units--a respectable amount, but less than half of the 154 million units the original DS line moved. It's difficult to say whether or not the system would have sold much more over its lifetime had it had a smoother launch, but it's clear that early stumbles are difficult to correct, and most platforms never fully recover from a rocky start.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is undoubtedly aware of these pitfalls, having gone through many successful (and not so successful) hardware launches over its long history. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">repeatedly stressed</a> the need to ensure Switch owners can "smoothly transition" to the console's successor, citing the Nintendo Account system as an integral component of this strategy. Like the 3DS, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/">Switch 2 will also be backwards compatible</a> with its predecessor. Nintendo has already confirmed the new system will play original Switch games, guaranteeing it has a deep library right from the outset (especially with major Switch 1 titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> still on the way later this year).</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the similar circumstances it finds itself in, Nintendo is in a better position than it was when the 3DS launched. For one, every public statement indicates Nintendo will treat the Switch 2 as a continuation rather than a fresh start, as it has traditionally done when launching a new platform. To date, every system Nintendo has released has featured a distinct online service and storefront, which meant the company was continually starting from scratch each generation. The Wii stands as a prime example: Although it gradually built up an impressive selection of retro Virtual Console games over its lifetime, once the Wii U launched, Nintendo had to wipe the slate clean and release the games--at its typical glacial pace--all over again on the Wii U eShop.</p><p dir="ltr">That will not be the case moving forward thanks to Nintendo Switch Online, which Furukawa confirmed will also be available on Switch 2. Over the past seven years, the subscription service has amassed a vast collection of legacy games between its base and Expansion Pack tiers, so out of the gate Switch 2 users will have access to a wealth of classics--and a continued reason to subscribe to the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Time will tell how the Switch 2 will ultimately fare whenever it finally launches, but these are promising signs that Nintendo is taking the lessons of its past failures seriously and is doing its best to avoid repeating the mistakes that have hampered its previous consoles.</p>

                <p>Nearly nine years ago, the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-more-new-switch-games-confirmed-after-nintend/1100-6457551/" data-ref-id="1100-6457551">Crashlands</a> introduced players to an alien space trucker named Flux Dabes as she survived a crash landing on the planet Woanope and crafted her way out of that jam. Flux's history will repeat itself this spring when Crashlands 2 arrives. In the new trailer below, Flux is literally dropped on to Woanope again as she is forced to make a new life for herself until she can get off-world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7fzLf59vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ib7fzLf59vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, Flux has to start over from scratch. That means if she wants a home, she'll have to build one herself. As before, Flux can craft her own objects and buildings, and she can also create weapons, traps, and any kind of gadget she needs to survive on Woaope. But on this world, Flux isn't necessarily on top of the food chain, and the alien creatures often hunt each other.</p><p>The announcement for the game also hints that Flux will uncover multiple mysteries on Woanope, and she'll be making some new friends to help her solve them. An ancient warrior named Grandmammy is among her new allies, in addition to Kleewik, an inventor who can employ Flux as a lab technician. Beyond mere escape, Flux's goal is to unite the various factions of Woanope, and "restore balance to the planet."</p><p>"Since the moment we launched the original Crashlands, we've been wanting to come back for round 2," Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster said in a statement. "But we wanted it to be bigger and better in every way, and it's taken many years to be able to pull that off. We can't wait to see newcomers experience the world of Woanope for the first time, and for players of the original to reconnect with Flux. So many people have told us that the original Crashlands was an important part of their childhood, and now we get to bring them a Crashlands 2 that's grown up as much as they have!"</p><p>Crashlands 2 will launch on PC, iOS, and Android on April 10, and players will be able to use cross-platform saves. The game is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>
