<figure data-uuid="5c76adae19fa1"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c76adae19fa1/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very nearly here. It's so close, in fact, that the reviews for the Switch 2 version of the game have now gone live, letting us all find out what we can expect from Samus' long-awaited adventure on the latest hardware.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a blast with Beyond, calling it "quite possibly the boldest, most well-realised Metroid game to date" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 9/10 review</a>. Here's a snippet, followed by the full shebang, so you can check out our thoughts for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 18 years of waiting, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions. Separating the main biomes with a vast open world sounds ridiculous on paper, but the slick traversal provided by Vi-O-La makes exploration more satisfying than ever</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:194214 @ 1764695439 -->
<p>But we're not the only review out there! Below, we've rounded up a handful of reviews from across the internet to give you a snapshot of the range of opinions on display. We predicted that this might be a rather divisive one in our review, and divisive it has been...</p>
<p>Kicking things off with a full beans 10/10 from <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/1900-805/">Giant Bomb</a>, where the outlet describes Prime 4 as "one of [Samus'] greatest adventures":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time will tell where I place Metroid Prime 4 in the ranking of the overall series, but fresh off my first playthrough, I feel comfortable putting it among the likes of Super Metroid and the original Metroid Prime</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>With a similar score to us, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a> awarded Prime 4 an 8.75 out of 10, praising just about everything the game has to offer, but feeling let down by the finale and save shenanigans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond maintains the high standard set by previous games in the series with incredible atmosphere and subtle touches that make the planet of Viewros look and sound real, but it is not without a handful of annoyances that hinder the immersion</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">TechRadar Gaming</a> opted for a similar 4/5, and while the outlet seemed up on the story and "gorgeous" visuals, its big sticking point came in the open-field desert area:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the desert was a touch smaller, and there were a few extra rooms to explore in each biome, it'd be on its way to sitting alongside the first two Prime games in quality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things dropped ever so slightly for <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+</a>, whose 3.5 review similarly struggled with the "padding" of the overworld, even amidst the excellent levels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within its actual levels, Metroid Prime 4 is triumphant, delivering immersive first-person exploration like nothing else in the genre, with some of the greatest levels in the series to date, dripping with potent atmosphere. But outside of those, Metroid Prime 4 is such a drag, and actively gets in the way of reaching those heights</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a> went for a 3/5, describing Prime 4 as "a game stuck between two worlds", as it tries to keep the series' backbone while trying something new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it’s emulating the series’ past, Beyond is an entertaining, if overly conservative, sequel. However, as the shadowy corridors make way for open-world fetch quests, and Halo-style expeditions with AI companions, it’s left feeling like a diluted experience that doesn’t fully deliver on the spirit of earlier entries</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a> also went for a 3/5, feeling let down by the game's ending and chatty companions, despite its high points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter how much you enjoy the gameplay part, I don't think there's much more disappointing than finishing a game that's relatively narratively-driven and thinking, "that's it?" at the credits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pretty large spread, no? At the time of writing, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metacritic</a> score of 80, based on 63 reviews. We'll have to wait a little while longer to see how things fare on Switch 1, but rest assured, we'll have our impressions on the old hardware release with you before long.</p>

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the biggest surprises of Cyber Monday was the excellent discount we saw on the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 + <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</strong>, which dropped the price of Nintendo’s latest console by $50. We expected the price to return to normal once the shopping holiday ended, but — surprise, surprise — it’s still going strong. Walmart is currently offering the gaming bundle for <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-plus-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle%2F16422361549" rel="sponsored">$449.99 ($50 off)</a> when you add it to your cart. Since it’s a high-demand item, you’ll need to create a Walmart account in order to go through the checkout process.</p><p>The current promo effectively gets you a free digital copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280" rel="sponsored">typically retails for $79.99</a> on its own (the limited-edition bundle normally retails for $499.99). Given that tariff-induced price hikes have recently made consoles like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">original Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Xbox Series X</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">PlayStation 5</a> to become more expensive, this deal is a welcome reprieve. However, we don’t anticipate it sticking around, so if you or someone you know is on the hunt for the Switch 2, now’s the time to pick one up.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a nice upgrade over the original, with an expansive 7.9-inch 1080p LCD screen, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and improved performance. It can play most original Switch games, and the system’s library of must-play titles continues to grow, with big releases like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/826488/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-vehicle-customization">Kirby Air Riders</a></em>, and the forthcoming <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/836519/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-walmart-deal]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Seems it’s a good day to be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> player: in addition to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-buffs-a-bunch-of-guns-nerfs-tongues-and-dials-down-the-drawbacks-of-using-scopes">buff-happy Into the Unjust 5.0.0 patch</a> that launched earlier, developers Arrowhead have shared an update on their efforts to shave down the co-op shooter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-does-helldivers-2-have-such-a-bloated-install-size-on-pc-old-hard-drives-says-dev">mammoth install size</a>. And it’s not so much a shaving as a fully fuelled chainsawing, high vis vests be damned. As the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/491583942944621372">Steam post</a> explains, there’s now a beta build, available to try, that cuts the 154GB game down to 23GB – a 131GB (!!!) reduction. That’s like surgically removing an entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> that was growing out of its back.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There’s more good news for owners of mechanical HDDs, the aged technology of which – versus new, cool, handsome SSDs – was lightly blamed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">previous dev blog</a> for the bloat that Helldivers 2 had developed. In short, the fear was that by removing duplicated assets, assumed to be vital in keeping the game playable on slow-loading hard drives, Arrowhead’s measures would render older and lower-spec PCs unable to make the dive. This, so says the new blog, turned out to be a miscalculation, with HDD users only expected to endure a few more seconds of loading screens. Not, it seems, an effective loss of support.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to say that our worst case projections did not come to pass," the post reads. "These loading time projections were based on industry data - comparing the loading times between SSD and HDD users where data duplication was and was not used. In the worst cases, a 5x difference was reported between instances that used duplication and those that did not. We were being very conservative and doubled that projection again to account for unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>"Now things are different. We have real measurements specific to our game instead of industry data. We now know that the true number of players actively playing HD2 on a mechanical HDD was around 11% during the last week (seems our estimates were not so bad after all). We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading. This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p>
<p>So the forest of identical trees wasn’t at fault after all. Sounds like everyone, myself included, owes those bark textures an apology.</p>
<p>It’s not a given though, that the lightweight 23GB build will arrive for all players as-is. A beta is a beta, which potentially means bugs, crashes, or indeed, longer load times than Arrowhead’s calculations predict. Even so, you can test it for yourself right now – opting in is just a matter of opening Helldivers 2’s Properties menu in Steam, navigating to the Betas tab, whacking "prod_slim" (without the quotes) in the Private Betas field, and selecting the slim build from the dropdown menu. To opt out, use the same menu to select "None", assuming you haven’t filled the last remaining 131GB of drive space up with high-resolution photos of redwoods in the meantime.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[After An 8 Year Wait, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Reviews Say It’s Fine]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621</link>
            <guid>1370593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3</em> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">eight years after the sequel was first announced</a>, Nintendo and Rare have finally finished<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</em> The long-awaited follow-up arrives later this week on Switch and Switch 2. And on December 2, ahead of release, reviews from critics went live across multiple outlets. In summary, <em>Prime 4</em> isn’t a bad game. But it doesn’t sound like a masterpiece either, falling short of past entries in the first-person shooter series.</p> <p>Launching on December 4, <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s last big game of 2025 and has a lot of hype and hope surrounding it. Fans have been wanting an <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-metroid-prime-4-zelda-mario-1850098941">entire console generation</a>. So when previews last month featured an overly talkative sidekick, a big departure from the often atmospheric and empty worlds of past <em>Prime</em> games, people were nervous. Would players quickly grow tired of some bumbling sidekick?</p>

 <p>The good news is that many reviews, even the less glowing ones, indicate that <em>Prime 4</em>‘s human characters aren’t overly annoying and aren’t as big a part of<em> Prime 4</em> as some had feared. Another concern fans had involved the open world connecting the various areas of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which Samus Aran traverses on a motorcycle. Many critics, even those who found the bike cool, weren’t convinced this was a necessary inclusion.</p> <p>Narratively, the world you explore in<em> Prime 4</em> is reportedly filled with excellent worldbuilding and lore teases, but some complained that this latest entry doesn’t feel like a complete story. Instead, it seems like it’s teasing the start of something more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Hopefully, if <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> gets a sequel, fans won’t have to wait another decade for it.</a></p> <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroidhttps://www.pcmag.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-prime-4-beyond">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>At worst, these characters are somewhat stock, providing a contrast against a singularly awe-inspiring figure like Samus. For example, there’s a chatty nerd and an old, gruff general. They leave you alone for long stretches of the journey, so when they’re deployed, it’s with purpose. Initially, your comrades explain tutorials at base camp. Later, they pop up for set-piece moments that advance the story and diversify the gameplay. In a nice touch, soldiers aid you in battle if you can protect them, and a hulking robot companion clears paths blocked by debris. There are some neat hints of worldbuilding as one teammate explains his spiritual beliefs, which sets up a lovely payoff. These supporting characters are Beyond’s weakest element, but they’re inoffensive and serve their purpose well. As always, <em>Metroid’s</em> real story is between you and the planet.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> thinks you are very, very stupid. Like, unbelievably dimwitted. At one point, I’m running through a room that only has one exit and one entrance. My companion runs over to the only other door I can walk through and shouts “This must be the way!” Later, I blast down a machine while standing on a bridge. Everything explodes around me in a cinematic and the camera focuses on a morph ball-sized hole that has appeared in the chaos. The scene continues long enough for a soldier to point directly at the hole and tell me that it’s the way out. I gain map data for an area at some point and a pop-up tells me that I can press the minus button on my controller to open it. A companion chimes in: “Wanna check your map?” I get it. Metroid games can be alienating for mainstream audiences, and the series has always struggled to find commercial success. Having linear biomes and tighter direction helps ease the on-ramp for players who are intimidated by the idea of getting lost.</p> <p>But Retro Studios has already solved for that time and time again: cutscenes that telegraph where to go, a scan feature that tells players exactly how to kill bosses, on-screen button prompts. The soldiers don’t replace any of those ideas; they quite literally talk over them. You now get up to three nudges at a time when you encounter an obstacle. And all of that is happening in the&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>major Nintendo series that isn’t geared towards its youngest players.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond/worth-the-wait">Game Informer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The first-person action gameplay is familiar to previous Prime games and feels good. Samus’ new psychic powers don’t radically change the fun lock-on, shooter gameplay, but I enjoyed remote controlling the Control Beam at opportune times in boss fights and to solve puzzles. The pacing and unfolding of each location are immaculately designed, funneling you toward objectives while consistently planting seeds that make you want to return later with expanded abilities. The desert hub area where Samus drives her motorcycle between objectives is the perfect size: Big enough that the motorcycle feels necessary, but not so big that you are ever driving for too long.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">GamesRadar+&nbsp;</a></em></h2> <blockquote> <p id="bf1a2720-ff20-45e4-b300-098b15f2c95a">The overworld, the dune-covered Sol Valley, feels similarly dated conceptually, and, again, closer to classic <em>Zelda</em> than any kind of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> twist I hesitantly expected – especially considering there are literally shrines that offer small puzzle challenges. There’s so few you can count them on two hands, and basically all amount to walking into a room and seeing if you have the power-up to progress or not – this is no bite-size revolution of the <em>Metroid</em> formula but something to fill an otherwise fairly empty open world map Sol Valley is how Samus accesses each of the five main key-hiding areas, which does make it the largest completely interconnected open world Metroid has ever had. Sort of. The problem is how much of a rigmarole it is to get back and forth between anywhere.</p> </blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>The central desert, which you’ll be crossing often as you go back and forth between the main areas, is fun enough. Vi-O-La, the bike, is a blast to drive, with a few fun and simple mechanics to experiment with. The desert does give the impression, though, that it was designed separately from the rest of the game. I genuinely wonder if it was outsourced to a different team. Even the loading zones seem to suggest this, as it doesn’t even directly connect to the dungeons. In each case, there’s a loading zone, then a tiny ‘staging’ area you can cross in about a minute,&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;the dungeon.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a Frankenstein fusion of ideas, which at its peaks delivers some great series moments, but at its troughs, feels like a dilution of the formula that made these games beloved in the first place. Throughout Prime 4, players neck-jerk between horror-style FPS sequences, open-world vehicle exploration, and comedy banter between a crew of wisecracking support characters. It’s an experience that feels like a collage of styles plucked from past Samus Aran adventures,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda,</em> and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, but never really settles into a clear identity.</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/"><em>Gamespot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>All of this is delivered with a visual fidelity on Switch 2 that is among the best we’ve seen on a Nintendo system. Sometimes particular details can look a little rough–some of the flora in Fury Green, or the industrial mesh grating of the Volt Forge, for instance–but other times it’s stunning. The frozen-over laboratory of the Ice Belt, or the futuristic beauty of Lamorn architecture in its artifacts, are particularly strong. It won’t match the best we’ve seen on PC or higher-powered consoles, but it’s a beautiful game regardless. Plus, I just love the look of Samus’ new suit, and in cutscene close-ups, the fidelity did it a lot of favors by showing the layers of its textures and materials.</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>It’s possible that a version of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;that leaned into the open-world aspects or even the party of secondary characters could work, but as it is now, both feel bolted onto a game that would be much better without them. Ultimately, much of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>&nbsp;feels like a failed experiment. As great as it is to explore the lightning-struck Volt Forge or pick through the haunted remains of the Ice Belt facility, the game’s standout moments are buried in drudgery.&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is thrilling at times, set across consistently beautiful environments, but it can’t stop getting in its own way.</p></blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 PC File Size Reduced by 85%]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/</link>
            <guid>1370590</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed that Helldivers 2’s file size has been reduced by 85%, and the new ‘slim version’ can be tried in beta. </p>



<p>The performance issues and installation size in Helldivers 2 have become a pain in Arrowhead’s neck, and they have been hard at work trying to solve these problems. The developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> in October on improving the game’s file size, and now they have delivered the result, reducing the installation size by more than 3 quarters. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-file-size-reduced-from-154gb-to-23gb">Helldivers 2 File Size Reduced from 154GB to 23GB </h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Steam states that the Helldivers 2 developers have made good progress on reducing the PC installation size while adding new content. Thanks to their partnership with Nixxes, the team has reached its goal sooner than expected, with all data being de-duplicated. The file size reduction will also help improve load times, “seconds at most”. </p>



<p>The new file size for Helldivers 2 on PC has been reduced to 23GB, which cuts 131GB (85%) from the previous 154GB installation size. The new ‘Slim version’ of the game has gone through several rounds of internal QA and has been rolled out for early adopters as a public technical beta. After the public beta returns with no issues, the slim version will become the default for Helldivers 2. </p>



<p>At the same time, the legacy version will be available as opt-in once the slim version becomes the default to help players “self-troubleshoot any issues that were not picked up during our internal testing or the public technical beta.”</p>

            <p>The team working on Amazon's live-action God of War series is growing.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a>, Emmy winning director Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Toye has worked on a number of acclaimed shows during his expansive career, including Westworld, The Boys and The Walking Dead. He is also no stranger to video game adaptations, having additionally helmed episodes of Amazon's Fallout series.</p>
<p>Last year, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for historical drama Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joins showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on Amazon's God of War series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>
<p>Pre-production for the show is now underway in Vancouver, and casting for the God of War series has begun. Do you have any thoughts on who may play who? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, while we still don't have a release window for the first season, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. To quote Kratos, "Boy!"</p>

            <p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> will now take up 85 percent less space on your computer, as Arrowhead has successfully reduced the installation size with help from Nixxes.</p>
<p>Until now, the game took up around 154GB on PC. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">studio explained it was looking into methods of reducing the size by eliminating duplicated assets</a>, but warned loading times for mechanical HDDs could be 10 times slower.</p>
<p>However, the studio's "worst case projections did not come to pass" and now it has successfully reduced the PC installation size down to around 23GB, a reduction of approximately 131GB.</p>

<p>Essentially, Arrowhead had previously duplicated a load of assets to maintain fast loading times for players using older, mechanical HDDs - this method makes it quicker for relevant data to be found. But as modern SSDs don't work in the same way, duplication is unnecessary and instead simply takes up more space.</p>
<p>By eliminating duplicated assets, the size has reduced with minimal impact on loading - "seconds at most," says Arrowhead, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">new blog post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>"We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading," the post reads. "This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p><p>This reduced size is available now for players if they opt in to test the "slim version". "You can also opt-out at any time if you experience issues," the post reads. "It's a low-risk way to save ~131GB of space on your drive and help us extend our testing to real-life conditions."</p>
<p>Once this technical beta confirms there are no issues, it will become the default for all players. "Given the very minor differences in loading times between the two versions, there is no justification for us to keep supporting the legacy version long term," the studio said. "Maintaining the legacy version alongside the slim version would only add extra burden to our developers, build machines, QA teams and release processes. Assuming all goes smoothly, the legacy version will be discontinued some time next year."</p>

<p>Yoshinori Konishi (director and programming director), Hiroki Hamaue (programmer), and Takahisa Ikejiri (art director) sat down to share their experience in developing this online multiplayer title, which is controlled entirely with the Switch 2's Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-20-drag-x-drive-part-1/">Part 1</a>, Konishi shares that the game was inspired by "sports such as wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, BMX and skateboarding", particularly the former. Hamaue had previously rode a wheelchair "for a research project back when I was a student", but for Konishi and Ikejiri, the first time they got to experience wheelchair basketball was at an experience in Osaka.</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytepMKq3hLRsg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0gqyspn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The developers purchased both an everyday wheelchair and sports wheelchair to help with the process. But the problem was that, as Konishi says, "We were restricted to the small space inside the office and could only let loose down the hallway once everyone else had gone home for the day. (Laughs)" because the project was tightly under wraps.</p>
<p>Talking about the wheelchair basketball experience, Ikejiri recalls that he "wasn't prepared for how difficult it was to shoot the ball. In wheelchair basketball, the hoop is placed at the same height as in standard basketball. But since you take the shot sitting down, my shot didn't reach the basket at all."</p>
<p>"Maneuvering a wheelchair is difficult unless you get the hang of when to apply and release force," Hamaue adds. "You can't just propel yourself along smoothly in a single stroke. But it cemented for me how deep the controls are".</p>

<p>As well as trying out wheelchair basketball for themselves, Konishi details the variety of reading materials the team gathered up: "From an encyclopedia of wheelchairs to videos and essays by wheelchair athletes and even manga about basketball or wheelchairs, we pulled together as much reference material as we could lay our hands on and studied it together."</p>
<p>And, crucially, wheelchair basketball players also got a chance to go hands-on with Drag x Drive during development, which provided Konishi and the rest with valuable insights: "Because the players use wheelchairs in their daily lives, they were all really good at turning and moving backwards in the game. Of course, we learned a lot about the controls, but we gained even more insights watching them think about what to do on the court as they played."</p>
<p>Hamaue adds that "seeing actual wheelchair basketball players get the hang of the game and its controls so quickly confirmed to us that it could work well as an intuitive control scheme." And we'd agree; there's nothing else quite like Drag x Drive on the market, and while its control scheme may not be for everyone, it makes for a unique experience.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-hopes-reignited/</link>

			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake continues to be among the most requested remakes of classic JRPGs released in the 90s. Although it is not officially on the horizon, something could be brewing, judging from Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii's reaction to a question related to the highly requested remake.</p>



<p>Speaking during a discussion program shared on YouTube on November 30, the legendary game creator was asked if the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th Anniversary projects</a> are suggesting that the game is being remade. Interestingly, Horii-san did not deny the existence of the remake, replying instead that he cannot say anything about the matter and that he shouldn't be asked about it.</p>



<p>Although Yuji Horii's reaction is most definitely not a confirmation that a Chrono Trigger remake is in the works, the fact that he did not deny its existence could be telling.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="【11/30(日)生配信】㊗️堀井雄二「旭日小綬章」受章！｜マクロン大統領の写真が！？｜「DRAGON BALL STORE」に行ってみた！｜「ドラクエ1&amp;2 リメイク」やってみた！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq1II1jaiuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time the creator of the Dragon Quest series, who also worked on the SNES game as one of its writers, has discussed this highly requested remake in recent months. Back in May, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">a translation error made during Horii-san's appearance at the Napoli Comicon </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank">sparked hopes of a remake</a>, which is reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/">only being considered for a possible HD-2D overhaul</a>, rather than</span> a full-blown remake.</p>



<p>Chrono Trigger was originally released for the SNES in 1995 and later ported to the Nintendo DS, PC, and mobile platforms. These enhanced ports include additional content not found in the original release, such as new dungeons, a new final boss, and a new ending which connects the game better with its sequel, Chrono Cross, which was <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition-iconic-yet-underserved/">remastered as The Radical Dreamers Edition in 2022. </a></p>



<p>Hopefully, these enhanced ports won't be the last we hear of what is widely considered one of the finest JRPGs ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Halts Tencent From Promoting Light of Motiram During Horizon Lawsuit, Court Dates Set for January 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-will-not-promote-light-of-motiram-sony-horizon-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1370551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first showcased Light of Motiram, practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">everyone online looked at it and pegged it as a clone/rip-off of Sony's Horizon series</a>. So it wasn't that much of a surprise to onlookers when Sony issued a lawsuit against Tencent, calling it a "<em>slavish clone</em>." Now, a new report from <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">The Game Post</a> reveals that the suit has moved into its next phase, during which Tencent has agreed not to promote Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>This new phase is also a slowing of the proceedings between Sony and Tencent, with both sides asking the court to extend the current briefing period and to schedule the court hearings on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">Tencent's motion to dismiss the case</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/">Sony's recent injunction</a> to the same date in January 2026. </p>



<p>In the meantime, according to the latest filing, which was submitted to the Northern District of California on December 1, both sides have, according to the report, "<em>engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agree, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction, (b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the</em> <em>Light of Moitram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction</em>."</p>



<p>The hearings for the motion to dismiss and the injunction will both take place on January 29, 2026, and ahead of that, Tencent will file its reply to Sony's injunction on December 17, 2025, with Sony's reply to that reply set for January 2, 2026. Basically, everyone is taking a big breath, and in the meantime, they'll prepare for what could be the conclusion of this suit by January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>Especially if the current discussions both sides have engaged in prove fruitful, and an agreement is able to be reached even before we get to the hearings in January.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Let It Die Offline Version Confirmed, Data Will Carry Over]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/let-it-die-offline-version</link>
            <guid>1370542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Supertrick Games and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have announced that they're bringing an offline mode to free-to-play action game&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>, thus, ironically, refusing to do what the game's title suggests.</p>

<p>During a recent stream focused on upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/let-it-die-offline-version-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), producer Uncle Death confirmed that an offline version of the game is coming since the studio has "gotten feedback from customers for a long time" asking for the feature.</p>

<p>The producer went on to say that Supertrick doesn't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode will be available, but that data will be carried over from the online version, so you shouldn't lose any progress when the new mode does arrive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=DDbVqkPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=bZRo6xH0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>is getting an offline mode soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The stream didn't contain any more information about&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode, but presumably, when it does arrive, you'll be able to play it on both PS4 and PC, assuming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">support for the former</a> hasn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-finals-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ended by then</a>.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode comes amid controversy surrounding upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno</em>, which, according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, uses generative AI for several assets and elements, including voices, music, background textures, and images.</p>

<p>Of course, GungHo and Supertrick aren't the only companies to be putting their eggs in the AI basket; our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">very own Don's recent report</a> shows that AI usage is becoming increasingly common in games on Steam, and companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">Krafton</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> have declared an affinity for the technology as well.</p>

<p>In any case, as far as we know, the original&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>doesn't use generative AI. What it does do, however, is offer a free-to-play action experience in which you can watch the Grim Reaper pull some sick skateboard tricks, and what more could you possibly want?</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/794600/LET_IT_DIE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0747-CUSA03769_00-APPLETITDIEUS000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, and the sequel,&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(which isn't free-to-play), launches on December 4th.</p>

<p>Writing duties will be handled by Gary Dauberman, who's best known for his work on movies like&nbsp;<em>Annabelle&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It</em>. Could this indicate that the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie will be heading in a more horror-oriented direction than we might previously have expected? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure I like the inference in that; it sounds to me like finding humanity in characters and finding "timely themes" in stories is somehow antithetical to video games, but perhaps I'm reading too much into things.</p>

<p>In any case, there's a lot we still don't know about the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, including what kind of story it's looking to tell and how it'll reconcile the franchise's satirical approach to individuality and democracy with movies' need to focus on individual characters.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the movie is just one of several visual media projects based on Sony games currently in the works; at the same time as the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie was announced, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">also revealed a movie based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is the first new Metroid Prime game in over a decade. No one thought it would happen at one point, and it has. Unfortunately, it’s the lowest-rated game in the Prime series, but it’s still reviewed quite well.</p>



<p>Another game is ready to go under the Christmas tree: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The legendary franchise sees all of your hopes and dreams curl up into a literal ball as you hunt Space Pirates and Metroids. Its review scores are ultimately not disappointing, but it probably misses GOTY conversations.</p>

<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores have all but settled on Metacritic. As of writing, based on 63 Nintendo Switch 2 reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has an aggregate score of 80/100!</p>







<p>Before you say anything, this is a very good score. An average game is usually around the 7/10 mark, making an 8/10 verdict excellent. Long-time fans and people who’ve been hyped for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond might be a bit disappointed by this score, compared to previous Metroid Prime games.</p>



<p>According to Metacritic, the original Metroid Prime sits at 97/100, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is on 92/100, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption drops slightly further to 90/100. This makes Beyond the first mainline ‘Prime’ game to fall below 90, and for a while, it was even under 80.</p>



<p>Everyone is so hyper-critical about reviews and scores nowadays, when the reality is that games should be supported. Will the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores stop you from buying it? Or is it a day one?

<p>Chris Avellone wants you to have a good time.</p>
<p>People often ask creatives—especially those in careers some dream of entering—”how did you get started?” Video game designers are no exception, and Avellone says that one of the most important keys to his success was one he learned early in his origin story.</p>
<p>“Players are selfish,” Avellone said, reflecting on his time designing the seminal computer roleplaying game <i>Planescape: Torment</i>. “The more you can make the experience all about them, the better. So <i>Torment</i> became that. Almost every single thing in the game is about you, the player.”</p>
<p>The true mark of a successful game is when players really enjoy themselves, and serving that essential egotism is one of the fundamental laws of game design.</p>
<p>It’s a lesson he learned long before he became an internationally renowned game designer, before <i>Fallout 2</i> and <i>Planescape: Torment</i> were twinkles in the eyes of Avellone and his co-workers at Interplay. Avellone’s first introduction to building fictional worlds came not from the digital realm but from the analog world of pen and paper roleplaying games.</p>
<h2>Table-top takeaways</h2>
<p>Avellone discovered <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> at the tender young age of nine, and it was a formative influence on his creative life and imagination.</p>
<p>“Getting exposed to the idea of <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> early was a wake-up call,” he told me. “‘Oh wow, it’s like make believe with rules!’—like putting challenges on your imagination where not everything was guaranteed to succeed, and that made it more fun. However, what I noticed is that I wasn’t usually altering the systems drastically, it was more using them as a foundation for the content.”</p>

<p>At first, Avellone wasn’t interested in engineering the games and stories himself. He wanted a more passive role, but life had different ideas.</p>
<p>“I never started out with a desire to be the game master,” Avellone remembered. “I wanted to be one of the players, but once it became clear that nobody else in my friend circle really wanted to be a game master—to be fair, it was a lot of work—I bit the bullet and tried my hand at it. Over time, I discovered I really enjoyed helping tell an interactive story with the players.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That revelation, that he preferred being the one crafting the world and guiding the experience, led to some early experiments away from the table as well.</p>
<p>“I never pursued programming for a career, which is probably to the benefit of the world and engineering everywhere,” he joked. But he did start tinkering very young, inspired by the fantasy text adventure games he played as a kid. “I wanted to construct adventure games in the vein of the Scott Adams games… so I attempted to learn basic coding on the TRS-80 in order to do so. The results were a steaming, buggy mess, but [the experience] did give insights into how games operate under the hood.”</p>

<p>It was a different era, however, bereft of many of the resources that aspiring young game developers have at their fingertips today.</p>
<p>“It being the early ’80s, there wasn’t much access to Internet forums and online training courses like today,” Avellone said. “It was mostly book learning from various programming manuals available on order or from the library. These programming attempts were always solo endeavors at fantasy-style sword and sorcery adventures, and I definitely would have benefited from a community or at least one other person of skill who I could ask questions.”</p>
<p>Despite all of his remarkable success in the space, Avellone didn’t originally dream of creating video games.</p>
<p>“Designing computer games was something I sort of fell into,” he told me. “The idea of a game designer was an almost unheard of career at the time and wasn’t even on my radar. I wanted to write pen and paper modules, adventure and character books, and comic books. As it turned out, though, that can be a miserable way to try and make a living, so when an opportunity came to work in the computer game industry, I took it with the expectation that I’d still use my off time to pursue comics, [pen and paper] writing, etc. But like with game mastering, I found computer game design and narrative design to be fun in itself, and it ended up being the bulk of my career. I did get the opportunity to write modules and comic books later on, but writing for games became my focus, as it was akin to being a virtual game master.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like many of the engineers and developers of that era, toiling in their garages and quietly building the future of computing, young Chris Avellone used other creator’s work as a foundation.</p>
<p>“One technique I tried was dissecting existing game engines,” he recalls, “more like an adventure game framework, and then finding ways to alter the content layer to create the game. But the attempts rarely compiled without a stream of errors.”</p>
<h2>The shine moment</h2>
<p>Every failure was an opportunity to learn, however, and like his experiences telling collaborative stories with his friends in <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, they taught him a number of lessons that would serve him later in his career. In our interview, he returned again and again to the player-first mentality that drives his design ethos.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a designer needs to “understand your players and understand why they are there,” Avellone said. “What is their power fantasy?”</p>
<p>Beyond that, every player, whether in a video game or a tabletop roleplaying adventure, should have an opportunity to stand in the spotlight.</p>
<p>“That shine moment is important because it gives everyone the chance to be a hero and to make a difference,” he explained. “The best adventures are the ones where you can point to how each player was instrumental in its success because of how they designed or role-played their character.”</p>
<p>And players should be able to get to that moment in the way they want, not the one most convenient to you, the game master or designer.</p>
<p>“Not everyone plays the way you do,” Avellone said, “and your job as game master is not to dictate how they choose to play or force them into a certain game mode. If a player is a min-maxer who doesn’t care much for the story, that shouldn’t be a problem. If the player is a heavy role-player, they should have some meat for their interactions. This applies strongly to digital game design. If players want to skip dialogue and story points, that’s how they choose to play the game, and they shouldn’t be crushingly penalized for their play style. It’s not your story, it should be a shared experience between the developer and player.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A core part of his design philosophy, this was a takeaway from pen-and-paper games that Avellone has deployed throughout his career in video games.</p>
<p>“The first application was <em>Planescape: Torment</em>,” Avellone remembered.</p>

<h2>Working on Planescape: Torment</h2>
<p>It was 1995. Interplay had recently acquired the Planescape license from Wizards of the Coast, formerly TSR, the company behind <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>. Interplay was looking for ideas for a video game adaptation and brought in Avellone for an interview. At the time, he was writing for Hero Games, a tabletop RPG publisher. Avellone was hired onto the project as a junior director after he sold the idea of a game where death was only the beginning.</p>
<p>That idea—the springboard that launched a successful, decades-spanning career—originated in Avellone’s frustration with save scumming, the process of repeatedly reloading save games to achieve the best result.</p>
<p>“Save scumming in RPGs up to that point felt like a waste of everyone’s time,” Avellone said. “If you died, you either reloaded or you quit. If they quit, you might lose them permanently. So I felt if you removed the middle man and just automatically respawned the character in interesting places and ways, that could keep the experience seamless and keep the flow of the adventure going. This didn’t quite work, because players were so used to save scumming and would still feel they had failed in some way. I was fighting typical gaming conventions and gaming habits at that point.”</p>
<p>That idea of death being just another narrative element rather than a fail state is emblematic of another pillar of Avellone’s design philosophy, also drawn from pen-and-paper games: Regardless of what happens, the story must go on.</p>
<p>“Let the dice fall where they may,” Avellone explained. “It will result in more interesting gaming stories. This was a hard one for me initially, because I would get so locked into a certain character, NPC, or letting a PC survive, that I would fight random chance to keep my story or their arc intact. This was a mistake and a huge missed opportunity. If the players have no fear of death or annoying adversaries who never seem to die because you are fudging the dice rolls to prevent them from being killed, then it undermines much of the drama, and it undermines their eventual success.”</p>

      Avellone is known for many classics, but among hardcore RPG fans, <em>Planescape Torment</em> stands particularly tall.

<p>After <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, which received nearly universal critical acclaim, Avellone continued to evolve best practices for giving players what they wanted. He eventually landed on the idea that player input could be useful even before development begins.</p>
<p>“I would often do pre-game interviews with different players,” he recounted, “to get a sense of where they hoped their character arc would go, how they wanted to play.”</p>

<h2>Lessons from <em>Fallout Van Buren</em></h2>
<p>Avellone expanded that process dramatically for <em>Fallout Van Buren</em>, Interplay’s vision for <em>Fallout 3</em>. He and the team built a Fallout tabletop role playing game to playtest some of the systems that would be implemented in the (ultimately cancelled) video game.</p>
<p>“For the Fallout pen-and-paper we were doing for <em>Fallout Van Buren</em>, for example, doing those examinations proved helpful because there were so many different character builds—including ghouls and super mutants, as well as new archetypes like Science Boy—that you wanted to make sure you were creating an experience where everyone had the chance to shine.”</p>
<p>Though <em>Van Buren</em> never saw the light of day, Avellone has said that some of the elements from that design found their way into the wildly popular <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, a project for which Avellone served as senior designer (as well as project director for much of the DLC).</p>
<p>Another lesson he learned at the table is that you should never honor a player’s accomplishment with a reward if you plan to immediately snatch it away.</p>
<p>“Don’t give, then take away,” Avellone warns. “One of the worst mistakes I made was after an excruciatingly long treasure hunt for one of the biggest hordes in the world, I took away all the unique items the characters had struggled to win at the start of the very next adventure. While I knew they would get the items back, the players didn’t, and that almost caused a mutiny.”</p>

<p>I asked Avellone if his earliest experience playing with other people’s code or sitting around rolling dice with his friends had a throughline to his work today. It was clear in his answer, and throughout our interview, that the little boy who fell in love with architecting worlds of fantasy and adventure in his imagination is still very much alive in the seasoned developer building digital worlds for players today. The core idea persists: It’s all about the players, about their connection to your story and your world.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“It still has a strong impact on my game design today,” he told me. “It’s still important to me to see the range of archetypes and builds a player can make. How to make that feel important in a unique way, and how to structure plots and interactions so you try and keep the character goals so they cater to the player’s selfishness. Instead of some outward, forced goal you place on the player… find a way to make the internal player motivation match the goals in-game, and that makes for a stronger experience.”</p>
<p>Avellone carries that philosophy forward into his current project. He recently signed on to help develop the inaugural project at Republic Games, the studio founded by video game writer Adam Williams, formerly of Quantic Dream. The studio is developing a dystopian fantasy game that revolves around a scrappy rebellion fighting to overthrow brutal, tyrannical oppression.</p>
<p>“Some discussions at Republic Games have fallen back on old RPG designs in the past,” he teased, “As some older designs seemed relevant examples for how to solve a potential arc and direction in the game… but I’ll share that story after the game comes out.”</p>

More than that, I'd found myself in a world I didn't even want to be in. I'd prided myself on never killing another player in the game. Through dozens and dozens of rounds, I'd gone well out of my way to avoid such an outcome, often being slow to shoot first, even to my own detriment. I put my trust in other players, and sometimes it would prove unwarranted. Mostly, I'd resorted to diplomacy, often talking my way out of problems with other players I'd encounter. I had so many big ideas about what it takes to return to Speranza without blood on one's hands. To me, Arc Raiders was this exciting social experiment. How long can I effectively talk down other players who means me harm? In the end, the answer was about 122 hours of play.</p><p dir="ltr">The fateful encounter occurred on Stella Montis, which will be no surprise to some Arc Raiders veterans. This newest map, and the first to take place entirely indoors, is an ultra-tense setting where you are either diligently checking your corners or you're soon bleeding out on the ground. Even in solo queues, where Arc Raiders remains mostly the bastion of good-natured and helpful PvE-only players, it feels like Stella Montis is kill-or-be-killed more than the game's other maps.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I was minding my own business, cautiously looting but certainly not planning to hurt anyone, when I heard some gunfire nearby. Hiding behind some lockers, I had a clear view of this fight, except for when it wrapped into the next room via the open doors leading to a hallway. I was still within range to hear the proximity chat of those who were scrapping, and witnessed with my eyes and/or ears a scuffle that took the lives of at least two players, whose flares shot toward the ceiling from inside the hallway. I crouched a safe distance away from the noise, then continued exploring other rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">I knew then that at least one person on the map that round had ill intentions, so I was more guarded than before, but I ran into some more friendly folks, and the round proceeded as most do for me in Arc Raiders; the troublemakers are always outnumbered. A few minutes later, I'd wrapped around and upstairs, and found myself now in the same region overlooking the dramatic hallway, only now I was a floor higher. Right then, I heard a pair of voices bickering from inside the hallway. One player was upset that the other had resorted to PvP because they felt solo queues aren't meant to be so unfriendly. The two had a reasonable philosophical discussion, as you can expect, but eventually one of the voices stopped talking.</p><p dir="ltr">I opened the hallway door, which had been closed during the scuffle, and called out, "What's going on in here? You guys good?" A player called out in response, but I couldn't tell by his voice if he was the apparent aggressor or the one attacked and seemingly resorted to killing in self-defense--a quick peek in the hallway revealed three or more raider bodies, to my memory. I couldn't see the survivor, but he told me he was knocked and asked if I had a defib. I always carry one because helping strangers in this game is my favorite way to play. But still, I was unsettled by all the chaos that this hallway had played host to in just a few minutes, so I wasn't so willing to walk in the door myself. I told him, "Crawl to me. I do have a defib. Crawl to me, and I'll revive you." </p><p dir="ltr">"Crawl to you?" he asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, can you make it in time?" I wondered, knowing his lifebar was evaporating, <em>if </em>he was truly knocked like he said he was.</p><p dir="ltr">He never said another word. Thanks to the way I peeked the corner, I saw him, not knocked, but standing--<em>sprinting</em>--into my room. He turned the corner and opened fire, and the only reason I survived is that I had a Torrente LMG with a few attachments--a decisive, unforgiving weapon at close range. Though the deceiver hit me first, my Torrente tore into him and knocked him sooner than he could knock me.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd found myself in these situations before. I hadn't killed anyone to that point in my Arc Raiders life, but I'd knocked a few. However, I always revived them or let their teammates revive them. I'd explain how I hadn't crossed that threshold yet, and I didn't want to start with them. It usually ended with them seeming thankful for my mercy.</p><p dir="ltr">I admit, I probably would've done the same with this charging liar if he gave me a chance, but he didn't. As soon as I knocked him, perhaps out of embarrassment for having been caught trying to pull a fast one on me, he used the "give up" command, effectively ending his life and crediting me with the kill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615056"></a><figcaption>This is just some of the carnage this hallway saw, though my first kill is just off-screen on the other side of the doorway on the right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4615056-a301fdc3-445e-43b0-a7d5-519a7fc7c464.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Before this round, I'd always wondered what I'd say to the first person I intended to kill in Arc Raiders. I'd go on some half-joking speech about how they were the first to bring me to that point, like a character in a movie who'd finally snapped, forcing them to listen to my diatribe as they crawled at my boots. But in the end, I never even got the chance. I only said one sentence to the raider before he quickly bled out: "Why'd you do it?!" Naturally, he didn't answer.</p><p dir="ltr">I felt a rush wash over me. Despite the violence that hallway had seen, I didn't see my part in it coming. I guess in the back of my head, I'd figured I'd talk my way out of a scuffle, or maybe I'd sneak away unscathed. Heck, maybe I'd just be the next gunned down, too slow to pull the trigger myself, but I certainly wasn't going to be the one leaving with bloodied hands. Until I was.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, I've killed one other player--also on Stella Montis and also because they'd charged me and fired first, then chose the "give up" command. I still play this game in a friendly way. I always carry a defib or two. If someone calls out, "Don't shoot!" with the game's vital emote wheel, I tell them they have nothing to worry about, and I mean it. But now that I've crossed the threshold, I do feel like the mental block that left me slow on the draw has lifted. Now, if I see other raiders, I tend to ask if they're friendly. If they say nothing, I get on my guard, and even if they say they're friendly, I keep my eye on them. I still don't ever plan to start fights, but since that fateful day in the halls of Stella Montis, I'm more prepared to finish them.</p>

                <p>Mark Cerny--best known as the lead architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4, and PS5--recently appeared on Simon Parkin's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hh8BAr4dqZ792CwE1db3r?si=0580cf10e978457a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console</a> podcast to choose five games he would preserve on a fictional console. While much of the conversation naturally touched on his long history with Sony, one of the most surprising and heartfelt moments came when he talked about his love for Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pikmin/">Pikmin</a>.</p><p>Despite his deep ties to PlayStation, Cerny made it clear that Pikmin left a lasting mark on him. Cerny described playing the original Pikmin as a truly "transformative" experience. He explained how emotionally invested he became in Captain Olimar's struggle to survive and return home.</p><p>"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs. Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin, I just [picked] out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story," Cerny explained. "Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands, and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship, or he'll run out of oxygen and die, and he's sending letters home every day."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYUJwdN07dI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OYUJwdN07dI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He went on to say how he loves a good story and the evolution in Pikmin 2. "I mean, I guess I'm a sucker when it comes to story, right? But then for Pikmin 2, it's totally different. So they're on Earth, they're running around picking up trash on Earth. That's the storyline, if you recall. Literally, you're running around somebody's bathroom floor in Pikmin 2. And in one of those, you're running from debt collectors, if I have that right. But that first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure.”</p><p>Although Pikmin was the emotional highlight of their conversation, Cerny also discussed the other games he selected for his fantasy console. These included Atari's Defender--a nod to his early days in the industry--as well as Sony's The Legend of Dragoon, the narrative-focused indie game Firewatch, and the highly acclaimed action-roguelike Hades. Together, his choices span several decades and represent a broad look at the evolution of game design.</p><p>Cerny stressed that he wasn't choosing games as a hardware designer, thinking about technical benchmarks. "I should also say this is not me designing a console, right? Because if I [were] doing that, it would be the usual, 'Well, how does GTA 6 play on it?' I'm just looking at interesting games over five decades."</p><p>Cerny's career has taken him through major studios, having created Marble Madness at Atari and worked on Sonic 2 after helping establish the Sega Technical Institute. Even being most associated with PlayStation hardware and Sony’s first-party studios today, seeing those plant-powered heroes on his list was quite a surprise.</p>

			<p>Work on the Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP multiplayer mod is proceeding at an impressive pace, culminating in a recent closed test that has reportedly exceeded all development team expectations.</p>



<p>The primary goals of this highly successful test were crucial for improving the experience, including checking improved synchronization between vehicles and players, introducing a new overlay, and evaluating the overall stability of the platform under load. Judging from new footage shared online by the development team, the test appears to have been a resounding success. A Race Event held during the test ran notably well and, honestly, looks like a ton of fun, demonstrating smooth vehicle handling and client-side synchronization.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mod footage also provides a quick look at a PvP event set on a wide map not available in the vanilla game. Much like the race event, this looks intense and engaging, showcasing the potential for large-scale player conflicts within Night City. It is clear that while the core system is solid, further work will be needed to iron out the remaining issues.</p>

<p>Although the project has been in the works since before 2024, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/">Cyberpunk 2077 CyberMP mod was officially announced only last year</a>. The team is stepping in to address the lack of an official multiplayer mode, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mode-was-canceled-due-to-the-games-rough-launch/">being developed by CD Projekt Red but was ultimately canceled to focus entirely on the single-player experience. </a>It's worth noting that the mod does not allow players to complete story quests together via a co-op mode. Instead, it leverages the game's mechanics to offer diverse multiplayer experiences, such as the racing and PvP events highlighted in the latest footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it won't take much longer for the community to experience the solid work the CyberMP mod development team is doing. More information on this <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> multiplayer mod can be found on its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eWQbTncXbr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Discord server.</a></p>

            <guid>1370497</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nine Dots Studio is hard at work on <em>Outward 2</em>, but studio founder, CEO, and Creative Director, Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, took a few moments out of his busy schedule to give us at TechRaptor a look at the current game. Giving us a tour of the new character creation, the ins and outs of Haboob, and what begins your adventure in Aurai, the preview was just the beginning. I also got to play a part of&nbsp;the title, feeling my way through the different areas you can explore. Here's all I learned in my&nbsp;<em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;alpha preview.</p>

<h2><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;Alpha Preview | No Hand Holding Here</h2>

<p>I spent a significant amount of time diving into the nooks and crannies of<em> Outward 2. </em>While I can safely say no Trog is safe around me, I died more times than I can count to Recluses, Thespians, Manticores, and falling into the water. I harvested and ate more mushroom soup than anyone probably should. Through it all, I explored most of the Bellowgale, kept finding more stairways in Haboob than I thought possible, and discovered most creatures will absolutely maim you when given the opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Outward 2</em>&nbsp;is currently in alpha phase. There’s still a lot of work to be done on the title, and everything I played through can completely change by the time it’s released in the summer of 2026. I’m going to focus more on the general mechanics, how it compares to the original<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc51a462-aeac-4113-b056-c6680d213c23" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outward" rel="nofollow">Outward</a></em>, and what is to come for the RPG.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=hBQ3V8ep 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-playtest-save-your-house.jpg?itok=0e01NbTk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This also means I won’t be commenting too heavily on bugs, missing dialogue, game crashes, and other issues that are current works in progress for Nine Dots Studio. Though these issues can have an impact on your gameplay in the upcoming alpha playtest, they should be eradicated by the time launch comes around. These issues should be reported to the dev team so they can be addressed.</p>

<p>To start at the beginning, Character Creation has been significantly expanded. Not only do traits and backgrounds impact character origins, but they also affect starting stats, where you begin your adventure, recipes you inherently know, and can offer unique dialogue choices. On top of that, you’ll no longer have a potato for your face unless you want to. There are multiple options for hair style, eyebrows, face structure, acne, scars, makeup, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=pEcyV3e9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/character-creation-outward-2-alpha-playtest.jpg?itok=SE9HwAKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When it comes to getting into the meat of the game, there are a few mechanics that have stayed the same from <em>Outward</em>. Your health and stamina maximum decrease when you get injured, dying results in a random event bringing you somewhere else on the map, an equipped bag slows down your dodges, and some quests are timed. You'll meet NPCs from the original, and may even be saved by Gep, again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are plenty more examples of things that have remained the same that you’ll stumble upon as you play, especially the difficult and brutal combat you’ll encounter. Many were worried that combat would begin to follow RTS mechanics, but fans can rest assured that the combat is the same as&nbsp;<em>Outward</em>. You have to unlock mana to use magic, skills are taught by trainers, and your attacks depending on how often you get to swing your weapon.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=13asAOOq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outward-2-alpha-playtest-saved-by-gep.jpg?itok=0HXijLdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While you only have a single city to begin from during the playtest, there are hours worth of content you can experience. You’ll be able to take on multiple quests, explore at least three distinct areas, and visit a Leyline. If you make it back into Haboob, you'll even see the city change from when you were exiled. After playing through the region three times, spending at least 18 hours in the wilderness of the Bellowgale, I'm still discovering new areas and interactions with NPCs.</p>

<p>What’s available of the narrative has ensnared me completely. I want to know more about the Symposium and their research, see the different regions, and learn why you were framed in the first place. There are two other starting cities to play through their beginning adventure. The story is there in the right portion to not inform me about the world and my current situation, while keeping me on the hook for future narrative.</p>

<p>There’s so much left to uncover, and I am 100% eagerly awaiting <em>Outward 2</em>’s release so I can experience it all. Combat was exciting, exploration kept me on my toes, and completing objectives consistently felt rewarding. Once it releases, I plan on this game taking over my life for quite a while.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hbo-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-mad-men-by-leaving-the-barf-machine-in-2000649617</link>
            <guid>1370482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mad Men</em> is probably one of the best 10 television shows ever made. It’s certainly one of the most important. It came to define a late aughts “golden age” of TV when the internet was full of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mollylambert/115625706564/the-almost-complete-ml-mad-men-recaps-s1e1-smoke">show recaps and essays</a> and aspiring networks were racing to land prestige TV hits that would win awards and convince critics that movies were no longer the most important medium for visual storytelling. So it’s equally fitting, in a way, that the 4K re-release of <em>Mad Men</em> on HBO includes sloppy oversights that make it emblematic of media’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">current enshitification</a> in the streaming era.</p> <p>The <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/mad-men-stream-hbo-max-4k-1236581005/">ultra-HD makeover</a> of AMC’s period drama about an advertising agency straddling the cultural revolution of the ’60s became available on HBO Max on December 1, and it includes some unique artistic choices. The most viral of those is leaving in the barf machine for one of the series’ most memorable moments. In season 1, episode 7, “Red in the Face,” Don Draper suckers his boss, Roger Sterling, into a late lunch break filled with booze and oysters and then races him up the Manhattan high-rise stairs when the elevator goes out of commission.</p>

 <p>Sterling gets back to the office just in time to puke in front of the entire agency, including important clients. It’s an important moment that underlines a bunch of conflicting fault lines within their relationship. It’s also very gross. In the new 4K version, viewers are treated to the actual puke machine that hurls clam chowder out of a pipe next to Sterling’s face, as well as the stagehands deploying it. It’s beautifully absurd and also kind of undercuts the entire scene.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the new 4K transfer of mad men on HBO somehow does not have any of the post-production edits added in, which means you get stuff like this where you can see the crew member manning the puke machine after Roger has too many oysters lmao <a href="https://t.co/HNgPRNOsla">pic.twitter.com/HNgPRNOsla</a></p> <p>— johnny (@bigrackspart7) <a href="https://twitter.com/bigrackspart7/status/1995756905755549751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“This is hilarious, and the extra hand on the crew member’s shoulder is killing me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbqafk/red_in_the_face_hbomax_4k_shows_staff_operating/">wrote</a> one commenter on Reddit. “Like someone else is giving him extra emotional support while he shoots fake vomit from a tube.” We’ve seen this sort of thing happen before, but it’s usually when <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paddypadman.bsky.social/post/3m6z3bnqxjs2u">older shows get updated to newer aspect ratios</a> and stuff that wasn’t originally intended to be part of the scene makes it into the frame.</p>

 <p>The fact that the apparatus and its handlers weren’t scrubbed out in post-production, as they were for the original version of the show, raises bigger questions about just how carefully HBO handled the re-release of one of modern TV’s most storied series. What kind of penny-pinching apathy lets the barf machine skate through the review process unscathed, and in the first season no less?</p>

 <p>I casually started re-watching <em>Mad Men</em> while doing other stuff just a couple of weeks ago and made it through the first two seasons in no time. Who at Warner Bros. Discovery thought it was a good idea to bring <em>Mad Men</em> back to a major streaming platform for the first time since it left Netflix back in 2020, and not skim it for issues? Especially since it was being upscaled to 4K? If they didn’t even catch the barf machine, what else did they miss?</p> <p>Well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pc20pw/season_one_out_of_order_on_hbo_max/">the episode order for one</a>. At least some users, including myself, tried to watch season 1, episode 7, only to find that it had swapped places <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/1pbth6b/red_in_the_face_replaced_with_5g_on_hbo/">with episode 6</a>, which had swapped places with episode 5. I guess David Zaslav didn’t want to pay someone’s nephew to sit in a room and do a final view test before releasing the 4K cut. Too busy thinking about Scrooge McDucking his way through mountains of cash if Netflix and Skydance <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-new-bids-netflix-comcast-paramount-1236439442/">get into a bidding war</a> over Warner Bros.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-doesnt-care-about-profit-on-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-priced-like-budget-android-tablet-2000649277</link>
            <guid>1370479</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="72447a38-387f-40b8-a390-2b9e2ddb309a" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-1">
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, you may think the time to save has come to an end. You couldn’t be more wrong. Lots of brands are keeping their discounts hanging around a little longer past the biggest sales event of the year. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is currently available for a drastically reduced price of $150.</a> The Samsung tablet normally sells for $220, so this 32% discount represents a savings of $70. Get it for as low as $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="371">The design of the Galaxy Tab A9+ is both slim and lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go use. It’s durable enough to withstand daily handling, whether you’re commuting, working at a café, or just moving between rooms at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h3 data-start="373" data-end="414">Exceptional Display and Sound Quality</h3>
<p data-start="416" data-end="960">For under $150, you get an 11″ touchscreen with an LCD display boasting a 1200p resolution and a 90 Hz refresh rate. Whether you’re streaming videos or just browsing the internet, the visuals are sharp and smooth. The tablet’s built-in speakers deliver clear, rich sound, enhanced by Dolby Atmos technology to give you “cinema-like audio your ears will love.” Now those are Samsung’s words, not mine. Marketing fluff. In practice, the only similarity between the sound when watching something on this tablet and watching something in a movie theater is that they are both indeed sound. So while it’s a bit of a stretch to compare tablet sound to a full cinema experience, it certainly provides better audio than most tablets in its class.</p>
<h3 data-start="1293" data-end="1342">Storage Options and Multitasking Capabilities</h3>
<p data-start="1344" data-end="1675">When it comes to storage, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers two options: 64 GB in the more affordable model and 128 GB in the higher-end version. This gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, and videos. However, given the rise of streaming services, you might find that you rely more on streaming content rather than downloading media. In which case, the 64 GB model should suffice.</p>
<p data-start="1677" data-end="1996">Powered by Android OS, the tablet makes it easy to multitask and switch between apps. You can view multiple apps side by side—great for when you’re managing multiple tabs in your browser or just keeping an eye on your email while working.</p>
<p data-start="1998" data-end="2273">File transfer is also a breeze thanks to Samsung’s Quick Share feature. It allows you to easily send files to another device, whether it’s running Android or iOS. Transferring photos, documents, or videos between your devices is quick and convenient.</p>


<h3 data-start="2275" data-end="2299">Perfect for Families</h3>
<p data-start="2301" data-end="2673">One feature that parents will appreciate is the Samsung Kids app. If you’re not ready to buy a dedicated tablet for your child, the Galaxy Tab A9+ offers a safe, fun, and educational environment for younger users. With its playful interface and age-appropriate content, it’s a great way to keep kids entertained while ensuring they’re using technology in a safe way.</p>
<p data-start="2699" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">If you’re looking for a deal, now is the time to grab the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+.</a> The 64 GB model is priced at just $150 after the 32% discount. Don’t miss out on this limited-time offer, available on Amazon in this post-Cyber Monday opportunity.</p>

As a result, Square Enix has launched various projects to celebrate the classic RPG. This includes a <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/piano_soundscape/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>brand new album</u></a> featuring piano arrangements of character themes, a character popularity poll (Frog took the top spot, as reported by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202511/59024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>), and <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/concert/30th/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>orchestral concerts</u></a> to be held in Japan next January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this sudden celebration of Chrono Trigger after very little fanfare about the cult classic has prompted speculation that Square Enix is leading up to a bigger reveal of a Chrono Trigger remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopes were reignited again among Japanese-speaking fans on November 30, when Yuji Horii was directly asked in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discussion program</u></a> on YouTube if all the recent Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary projects and events are hinting that a remake is in the works. Horii did not outright deny it, responding with "I can't say," "You shouldn't ask that!" and "I'll get told off!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and publishing executive Kazuhiko Torishima's jokey follow-up cries of "There is! There is (a Chrono Trigger remake)!” have led to Japanese speaking fans hoping, once again, that a remake is in the works despite the fact Square Enix hasn't made any announcement. “I wonder if it will be announced next year?” <a href="https://x.com/kasago_p/status/1995458296199667729?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>users</u></a> wondered on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chrono Trigger was originally released for the Super Famicom/SNES in 1995. With the involvement of Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, the RPG is beloved by fans and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time. Although an upgraded version is currently available to play through Steam and on smartphones, fans have been calling for Chrono Trigger to get the remake treatment for years.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">25 Games That Still Deserve A Sequel</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent Dragon Quest HD-2D remakes have also got Chrono Trigger fans hopeful about seeing the SNES game recreated in the same style. “I want to play Chrono Trigger with beautiful graphics like these!” said <a href="https://x.com/rus_08F/status/1994982553292607650?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a user</u></a> on X. “Please, Square Enix!” Official posts by Square Enix accounts about Chrono Trigger anniversary merch have also attracted similar enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/qvjB3Fkf25tsQVV/status/1993542117134942602?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comments</u></a> like, “If there’s a remake I’ll definitely, definitely buy it!” In November, Japanese game news site<a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/56445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Dengeki Online did a poll</u></a> of games readers most wanted to see get the HD-2D treatment, and Chrono Trigger topped the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation is similar to that of Final Fantasy IX, with the game’s 25th anniversary celebrations this year also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>stoking fans’ hopes</u></a> that Zidane and Garnet’s adventures are in line for the remake treatment, although in IX’s case the rumors were backed up by the infamous 2021 Nvidia leak, which showed that a FFIX remake was possibly on Square Enix’s to-do list at one point. However, it seems that for both games, the anniversary celebrations were simply a chance to revisit these classic games through events and new merch. Until an official announcement is made, all fans of both games can do is continue to express their enthusiasm for these classic RPGs to Square Enix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
