			<p>Today, HypeTrain Digital and Ice-Pick Lodge announced Pathologic 3, a new installment in the peculiar series that began with 2005's indie cult and continued with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathologic-2-driving-you-to-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019's reboot</a>. Pathologic 3 will be launched next year on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>).</p>
<p>In the new game, players will again find themselves in a small, remote town struck by a mysterious and deadly disease. This time, however, they will take on the role of The Bachelor, a town doctor known for his relentless battle against death. Invited to the town by the late Isidor Burakh, The Bachelor must navigate the unfolding mystery, striving not only to save the town but to defeat death itself.</p>
<p>For the first time in the series, Pathologic 3 introduces a new time travel mechanic that allows players to revisit key events and alter them to their advantage. While the player still has only 12 days to save the city, this innovative mechanic allows them to explore and influence events in ways that reshape the unfolding narrative.</p>

<p>Game Director Nikolay Dybowski said:</p>
<p><em>We are making a game about how a person develops their mind to learn how to work with things they previously couldn't or didn't know how to notice. Our goal is to understand what this means for the player. Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves. That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect.</em></p>
<p><em>We can describe the concept of this time travel mechanic as surrealist time management. Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path. We want to show the player the possibility of existing in a world that is disassembled and functions in a way quite different from what we’re used to expecting.</em></p>

<p>Pathologic 3 will also let players immerse themselves in the role of a physician. They will get to diagnose and treat patients based on examinations, use a microscope and research pathogens to develop treatments and save patients, and even fight the rampant epidemic by implementing quarantines and deploying patrols to lock down the spread of disease.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-brings-more-haunting-immersive-sim-goodness-next-year.1002888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, a third installment in the relentlessly miserable and fascinating&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>series. It's targeting a 2025 release.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, <i>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</i>offers only one playable character: the Bachelor, a doctor "famous for his fight against death himself". As the Bachelor, you'll explore another disease-ridden town, uncovering its secrets and battling the plague that has the town in its grip.</p>
<p><em>Pathologic 3</em>'s unique twist on the formula that made its predecessors so unique is a time-loop mechanic with which you can "revisit key events and alter them to [your] advantage". You'll still have just twelve days to save the town, but this new time-loop system should make things a bit less punishing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-announced-plague-doctor.jpg?itok=S-t4RPcs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-announced-plague-doctor.jpg?itok=dUZWT99D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>brings more relentlessly bleak fun next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Ice-Pick Lodge and HypeTrain are promising the same "chilling, immersive world that made&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>a cult hit", now with more "layers of narrative complexity".</p>
<p>As a doctor, you'll be able to diagnose and treat your patients using medical procedures; you'll need to examine patients, use your microscope to identify pathogens, and develop treatments to help patients overcome their illnesses.</p>
<p>You can also battle the plague by "implementing quarantines and deploying patrols", so it sounds like you've got more power than just treating individual patients.</p>
<p>Of course, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>game, you can expect your every choice to impact the story in a meaningful way, and you can also expect to meet a host of characters that you absolutely cannot and should not trust as far as you can throw them.</p>

<p>It seems like&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>grew out of the seeds of an intended update for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced">would have introduced a new Bachelor scenario</a> to that game. Now, however, it appears that Ice-Pick Lodge has spun that route out into an entirely new&nbsp;<em>Pathologic&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>Found a dead rat in my inbox this morning. When I examined the entrails it spelled out the following: PaThoLoGiC 3 aNnOuNcEd ToDaY.  Ah, I see. Developers Ice Pick Lodge are working on a sequel to their infamously oppressive plague town simulator, only this time the follow-up will feature "a time-travel mechanic, allowing players to go back and see how their decisions change the lives of the townspeople." It will also put you in the fancy-schmancy shoes of the Bachelor, a doctor fond of quoting Latin phrases, who will have the ability to order quarantines and request patrols of entire areas of town. There's no firm release date yet, but we're told it'll be ready some time next year.</p>

<p>As the Bachelor the player will be more of an academy physician than the previous protagonist, using a microscope and various lab equipment to "research pathogens". Judging from screenshots and the game's description, there's also some sort of management shenanigans going on too. "Fight the epidemic by implementing quarantines and deploying patrols to lock down the spread of disease," say the game's creators.</p>
<p>The "time travel", meanwhile, looks like the Rashomon sort, as opposed to anything mystical or mad sciencey. "No, remember how things <em>really</em> happened..." That kinda thing. The player still only has 12 days to make their mark on the town, say the devs, but the ability to go back and alter some decisions will let you "explore and influence events in ways that reshape the unfolding narrative". </p><p>To clear up any confusion: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a>, despite the number in its name, is not a direct sequel to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a>, but an extensive remake. In the original Pathologic, players could play as one of three characters - the Bachelor, the Changeling, or the Haruspex. For Pathologic 2 the developers chose to make the Haruspex the default player character at launch, with plans to add the other two characters in later updates. It looks like those plans have changed, and the devs are straight-up slapping another number onto the series. Does this mean players will also need to buy Pathologic 4 some day to see the Changeling's version of events? Who knows.</p>
<p>I wasn't too enamoured with Pathologic 2 when I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2-review">our review</a> of the initial release, finding a fascinating world bogged down with an overzealous hunger meter and other survival meters. But later updates allowed players to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2s-easy-mode-lets-you-soak-in-the-dread-of-an-unwell-town">tweak difficulty settings</a>, which improved things for my run massively. I eventually enjoyed much of the game, like this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2-train-summoning">wonderfully creepy moment on a derelict train track</a>. </p>
<p>Many Pathologic fans did not seem to care about the harshness of the world at all, though. Noted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNEQs68acww">congressional necksnapper</a> of the Left, "Hbomberguy", made a good argument for the game's merit despite (thanks to?) its bleakness in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsNm2YLrk30">characteristically chunky video essay</a>, never mind that he personally called me out in it, THE BIG POO POO HEAD. Will this third sequel become an extension of our beef? I hope not. I have enough blood in my inbox as it is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Why yes, that <em>was</em> a micro change in air density you just noticed on your motion tracker. Ten years since the release of horror adaptation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-isolation">Alien Isolation</a>, Creative Assembly have announced that they're making a sequel.</p><!--more-->
<p>"On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear," reads a post from Al Hope, the original game's creative director, on <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488">Xitter</a>. "Today, I'm delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to Alien: Isolation is in early development. We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready."</p>
<p>There's nothing more to say, so you'll have to fill the void with your inaudible screaming. Here's a little recap of the 2014 monstrosity to help with that: Alien Isolation casts you as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen, who is stuck on a huge space station with a single, unpleasantly adaptable and essentially unkillable Alien. The whole game is about that relationship, give or take a few bullying androids - as you master various means of distraction and deterrence, the Alien "learns" about you, growing more aggressive and tenacious. The space station itself is a beautiful homage to the film's aesthetics - dare I call it Nostromantic? - though it's perhaps a little larger than it needed to be. At 20-30 hours in length, Isolation does come perilously close to wearing out its welcome.</p>
<p>It's one of my favourite horror games regardless. I remember visiting Creative Assembly's offices in 2011 or so, after they announced an Alien universe collaboration but before they revealed or said anything about Isolation. After asking some highly fishy, leading questions about recent hires and their vision for the franchise, I threw my hands up in exasperation and proceeded to complain for about five minutes that video games take too much inspiration from Aliens and its Colonial Marines, when all I want to do is be trapped in a big, Gothic labyrinth with a persistent nemesis and no actual gunplay at all.</p><p>I was absolutely beside myself when the developers in the roundtable all simultaneously adopted the same expression of glassy-eyed smugness. "We think you will like our game," one of them ventured. I hurried on home and proceeded to eat my hands for three years, until the formal reveal. Today, I begin to eat my hands anew.</p>
<p>Here is our original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-review-pc">Alien Isolation Wot I Think</a>, written by Adam Smith (RPS in peace), who of course is now Duke of Words at Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian. An extract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isolation is the best Alien game I've ever played, I'm in no doubt about that. Even in its awkward moments it is doing something interesting with the license, exploring the edges of what is possible in its world, quietly and discreetly. I expect the debate about certain design choices to be loud and long. At the centre of the debate will be one of the finest entries in the Alien canon in any medium, and one of the finest horror experiences in ours. </p></blockquote>
<p>The prospect of an Isolation sequel aside, it's nice to see Creative Assembly getting work that isn't Total War. The developers have had a rough year or two, with Sega <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">cancelling their first-person shooter Hyenas</a> amid layoffs, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-devs-creative-assembly-to-refocus-on-offline-rts-games-after-ditching-online-shooter-hyenas">shoving their noses ever deeper into the strategy game genre</a>. At the risk of being a negative Nancy here, I'd say the new Alien game has a lot to prove within Sega, and 10 years is a long time - how many of the old Isolation team are still there?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s a metric ton of exciting third-person shooter encounters, which often challenge players to make the best of their character classes as well as those of their allies, and strategically deploy the right weapons and skills to survive to see another day. if that’s the kind of thing you look to RPGs for, this seminal series from the mid-to-late aughts delivers in spades.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-best-worst-citadel-dlc-ending-1849502801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-andromeda-best-worst-citadel-dlc-ending-1849502801"><em>Mass Effect </em>games</a></span> take place in a future where humanity has discovered the means to travel over incredibly long distances across space via these left-behind devices known as mass relays. These mass relays help humanity establish contact with several species of aliens, and they all <em>mostly</em> come together to form a unified society. However, various threats begin to crop up at the time that the first game begins, which set in motion a sweeping adventure across the stars and back to save the galaxy from an ancient and advanced civilization that’s been dormant for a long time.</p><p>You play as Commander Shepard, a decorated war hero and eventual black ops Spectre agent, who finds himself (or herself) caught in the middle of all of this strife and bearing the weight of every living thing on his shoulders. It’s a lot for him to do on his own though, and so across the entire trilogy of games, Shepard comes to rely on many allies, friends, some rivals, and even a handful of lovers or partners. This<em> </em>focus on interpersonal relationships is perhaps the single most enduring aspect of <em>Mass Effect</em>.</p><p>Given that focus, it’s hugely important that <em>Mass Effect </em>has one of the most memorable casts in video games. Over the course of three games, many recurring characters enjoy rather full narrative arcs, which is uncommon these days. Urdnot Wrex and Garrus are two examples of characters that recur throughout every installment, enjoying a bevy of character development in each title against a backdrop of large and complex narratives concerning their shared histories and those of their people. Many of the cast, like Garrus, Thane, Tali, Liara, Miranda, and more, have become objects of romantic and sexual fascination for many players, and the romances and sex scenes that have sprung from the series have imprinted themselves on the impressionable minds of many players since 2007.</p><p>Besides the deep characters and relationships that <em>Mass Effect </em>has traditionally offered players, it’s also just one of gaming’s few real epic sagas. Even if I don’t rate the games quite as highly as many others do, it’s hard to deny the impressively high standard that the series set, as well as the difficulty that many developers, Bioware included, have had in matching it ever since.</p><p><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition </em>doesn’t just compile all three of those classic RPGs together, it also serves as a remaster. All three games received some visual reworks, though the earliest game receives the biggest facelift of the bunch due to its age. The collection also features most of the single-player DLC that was released for the games, including the widely beloved <em>Shadow Broker </em>and <em>Citadel </em>expansions for <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>and <em>3</em>, respectively. Additionally, there are quality-of-life changes that bring the first and second games into alignment with the final installment, including a rework to <em>Mass Effect</em>’s Mako vehicle handling.</p><p>In short, you’re getting pretty definitive versions of one of gaming’s biggest stories for a measly 10 bucks. Think of the dumb little things you spend 10 bucks on during an average day. Skip the little treat just once and snag <em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition </em>for cheap while you still can. Considering there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">sequel coming…eventually</a></span>, I promise it’ll pay for itself down the line. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero goes into early access today, and if you are looking to get into some battles online, here are some tips and tricks to help you out. Bandai Namco’s latest instalment has brought many changes to how you traverse across the massive arenas. Check out the Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Movement guide to learn everything you need to know about this system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the player’s movement is critical for them to win, whether it is going on the offensive or the defensive. The different ways you can move across the game’s stages include Step/Short Dash, Dragon Dash, Z-Burst Dash, Quick Ascend and Descent.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-different-types-of-movement-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Different Types of Movement in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>



<h3 id="h-step-short-dash">Step/Short Dash</h3>



<p>Step is the new movement mechanic in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, allowing you to move around the stage more quickly. Players Step by pressing the X/A button, which can be used to move closer to the opponent, create distance, or evade blast attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-dragon-dash">Dragon Dash</h3>



<p>Dragon Dash is a high-speed dash in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero that allows players to cover a lot of distance quickly, whether away from the opponent or closer to them. Press the R2/RT trigger and the X/A button to perform a Dragon Dash. Dragon Dashes will use Ki to activate and can be used for Rush Combos or Smash Attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-z-burst-dash-nbsp">Z-Burst Dash&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This movement mechanic makes your dash even faster, allowing players to get behind their opponent during a Dragon Dash. Z-Burst Dash can be performed using the following combination: R2/RT + X/A + X/A. This move will use up your Ki faster than Dragon Dash, but at the same time, it will be harder to guard it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-quick-ascend-and-descent">Quick Ascend and Descent</h3>



<p>The last movement mechanic in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero can be used to take the battle airborne or bring it back to the ground. A Quick Ascend can be performed by pressing the R2/RT trigger while pressing L1/LB; the Descend, on the other hand, uses the same trigger, R2/RT, but needs you to push the other trigger as well, L2/LT. Both moves will emit Ki Aura and consume the player’s Ki Gauge.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In <em>Pathologic 3</em>, players once again find themselves in a small, remote town gripped by a mysterious and deadly disease. This time, however, they will step into the shoes of The Bachelor, a city doctor renowned for his relentless fight against death. Invited to the town by the now-deceased Isidor Burakh, The Bachelor must navigate the unraveling mystery, striving not only to save the town but also to conquer death itself.</p><p>For the first time in the <em>Pathologic</em> series, <em>Pathologic 3</em> introduces a new time-travel mechanic that allows players to revisit key events and alter them to their advantage. While the player still has only 12 days to save the town, this innovative mechanic grants them the freedom to explore and influence events in ways that reshape the unfolding narrative.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step Into the Role of The Bachelor</strong> – A city doctor famous for his fight against death itself, tasked with unraveling a web of dark secrets while battling a relentless plague.</li><li><strong>Doctor, Do No Harm</strong> – Immerse yourself in the role of a physician. Diagnose and treat patients based on examinations. Use a microscope and research pathogens to develop treatments and save your patients. Fight the epidemic by implementing quarantines and deploying patrols to lock down the spread of disease.</li><li><strong>Master Time Travel</strong> – Manipulate time to change events and unlock new outcomes.</li><li><strong>A Dark, Surreal World</strong> – Explore a decaying town on the brink of collapse, where every choice carries weight, and trust is a luxury you can’t afford.</li><li><strong>Haunting Atmosphere</strong>&nbsp;– <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the chilling, immersive world that made <em>Pathologic</em> a cult hit, enhanced with new layers of narrative complexity and eerie, unsettling visuals.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves,” Dybowski said. “That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect.”</p><p>Dybowski also discussed the new time-travel mechanic.</p><p>“We can describe the concept of this mechanic as surrealist time <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>,” Dybowski said. “Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path.

            <p>

If you've been impatiently awaiting the arrival of Commandos: Origins since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/commandos-origins-revives-the-real-time-stealth-tactics-classic-next-year">announcement last year</a>, here's the next best thing; Claymore Game Studios' revival of the classic WW2 real-time stealth-tactics series now has a PC and Xbox demo ahead of its release later this year.
</p>
<p>
The Commandos series, if your history is a little hazy, first surfaced in 1998 with the release of developer Pyro Studios' classic (and rock-hard) Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines. Since then, there've been five additional instalments, the series eventually fizzling out with the launch of 2006's first-person effort, Commandos: Strike Force.
</p>
<p>
Commandos: Origins, though, takes the series back to its roots, delivering a stealthy World War 2 prequel adventure in which players guide the original six-strong team of commandos through the likes of sabotage and assassination missions as they travel from European coastlines to icy Arctic plains and African deserts - all presented using the series' classic isometric perspective, albeit now rendered in full 3D.

<p>
Commandos: Origins' newly released demo (available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3137720/Commandos_Origins__Demo/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/p/commandos-origins-demo-win/9mtnk7lvk8pc">Windows PC</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/commandos-origins-demo/9nq8p31k009d">Xbox Series X/S</a>) isn't taken directly from the upcoming game, instead being what publisher Kalypso Media is calling an "demo-exclusive test mission". Here, players control squad members Jack O'Hara (Green Beret) and James Blackwood (The Marine) as they attempt to sabotage a German radar system, "against the backdrop of the Channel Islands during World War 2".
</p><p>
The full game will include "more than 10" missions featuring both core and optional objectives - each completable in multiple different ways - with two-player local and online co-op support available for anyone wanting to get stuck in with a friend.
</p>
<p>
Commandos: Origins still doesn't have a release date beyond "2024", but it'll be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Microsoft Store) when it does show up. And if you need to sate your thirst for real-time stealth tactics before then, you could always try your hand at this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumerian-six-a-pulpy-nazi-bashing-stealth-tactics-treat">pulpy alternate-history WW2 adventure Sumerian Six</a>, or 2023's piratical delight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>.

<p><em>To our fans around the world:</em><br>
<em>It’s hard to believe that it has been 10 years since we embarked on our journey with the release of ALIEN: ISOLATION.</em></p>


<p><em>When we started developing ALIEN: ISOLATION, we had one guiding principle: to create a truly authentic experience that went back to the roots of the ALIEN franchise – a new story capturing the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie masterpiece.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s been nothing short of incredible to witness your passion for the game over the years and see it reach so many players around the world.</em></p>
<p><em>On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear.</em></p>

<p><em>Today, I’m delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to ALIEN: ISOLATION is in early development. We look forward to sharing more details with you when we’re ready.</em></p>
<p><em>Once again, thank you.</em></p>
<p><em>Until next time,</em><br>
<em>Al Hope, Creative Director – ALIEN: ISOLATION</em></p>
<p>Fans have been clamouring for a sequel for many years as Isolation is regarded as the best Alien game by far, we scored it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review/">9/10 in our review</a> with Peter saying “That idea of never being comfortable with how the game is unravelling is something that feels quite unique and it’s extremely well imagined here. Plenty of survival horror games have you feeling vulnerable as you essentially fulfil the role of a hero but things are different here. In you’re not the hero, you’re the prey.”</p>
<p>Since the game launched on PS4 and Xbox One it has been ported to Switch and there’s even a mobile version which is highly regarded.&nbsp; There have also been novels based on the game and the main character, Amanda Ripley, has appeared in other graphic novels, games and books,</p>

			<p>Today, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Global Launch Gameplay Trailer was released, with the countdown officially started. The game is set to release this month, with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arriving globally on October 25, 2024. For most games, a launch trailer does not typically come out this early and is usually released a few days before the game's full release, if anything. However, the global launch trailer has been released with 18 days until release.&nbsp; For the first time in many years, this is the first time Activision has decided not to go for an Early Access period before the global launch of the game. Typically, Activision would use the Early Access period to allow excited fans into the campaign early, but this time, it has decided not to do that. It's possible that it was done because of how poorly received the Modern Warfare 3 campaign was last year, even though plenty of fans tend to flock straight away to Multiplayer and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-set-to-launch-with-two-maps/">Zombies</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement made by Activision, they explained the choice to go in a different direction for this release. "The team is fully focused on October 25. We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25th. As such, there is no Early Access beat this year for Black Ops 6, just the countdown to launch."</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0uxvKUjsj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, with the launch trailer out, Call of Duty fans seem to be quite excited about Black Ops 6, with plenty of buzz floating around. The trailer is gritty and immersive, and players will get to explore a dark, ambiguous story, whereas the Multiplayer is a starkly different experience. In previous games, players would get to dress up as cats, pigeons and other fun characters while playing multiplayer, with this element being predominantly in Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>
<p>However, this trailer is focused solely on the Campaign, where players will get to experience a high-intensity campaign with a similar vibe to that of Call of Duty: Black Ops and Call of Duty: Cold War. The trailer features a great soundtrack, providing great energy for the trailer and getting players excited for the global release of the title.</p>
<p>For those that want to get stuck into the game but don't want to pay the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big price tag</a> of the game, this is the first mainline Call of Duty game that will be launching straight onto Xbox and PC Game Pass, making it more accessible for those already using the subscription service.</p>

This time, in the new <em>Vessel of Hatred </em>expansion for <em>Diablo IV</em>, you’re in pursuit of poor, tormented Neyrelle in the Hate-ridden lands of Nahantu. Much as I’d like to tell you that there’s a nice handy little pamphlet titled, “So, You Just Sent An Innocent One-Armed Girl Into The Heart Of A Jungle Full Of Demons,” sorry to tell you, it’s just not the case.<br></p><p>If it makes you feel better, Neyrelle never got the “So, You Decided To Carry An Archdemon’s Crystal Prison Into A Jungle Full Of Demons” pamphlet either, so, imagine the day she’s having. But, y’know, you’re The Wanderer, you got this, mostly—just mow down anything in your way that isn’t trying to give you a sidequest. Regardless, we have a few solid tips to set you up for success on this bloody little jungle cruise.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76c4fad1518a70ae4a5a5250c69d0170" data-recommend-id="image://76c4fad1518a70ae4a5a5250c69d0170" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="New character screen in Vessel of Hatred." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="New character screen in Vessel of Hatred." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76c4fad1518a70ae4a5a5250c69d0170" data-recommend-id="image://76c4fad1518a70ae4a5a5250c69d0170" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="New character screen in Vessel of Hatred." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, Blizzard could’ve just opened up the DLC area, told you, “Go have fun you little scamp,” and called it a day. But no, they’ve actually taken the opportunity to tweak the basic experience a little. If you’ve been away a while, it’s worth spending a little time getting acquainted. For starters: if you decide to make a new character to try out the Spiritborn class, keep in mind that whether you do the campaign again or jump right into Vessel of Hatred, you still need to clear the Prologue. After that you can exit out and go to the Seasonal mode at your leisure.</p><p>Once you do jump in, you’ll notice there are quite a few more options for difficulty as well, with the World Tier system changing from just Worlds I-III to around half a dozen Torment levels, each more hostile than the last. Jewels now get their own tab instead of taking up valuable space in your loot inventory. And there have been tweaks to each existing class’s damage outputs and movesets as well, along with a change in level cap (Paragon system now unlocks at lvl 60). The list goes on, and it’s worth taking an hour or so getting reacquainted before heading out on your quest.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7af7bd65118eed185644cb116dfb1bd6" data-recommend-id="image://7af7bd65118eed185644cb116dfb1bd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="So many demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="So many demons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7af7bd65118eed185644cb116dfb1bd6" data-recommend-id="image://7af7bd65118eed185644cb116dfb1bd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="So many demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once the main Vessel of Hatred story quest takes you down to Nahantu, you’ll run into the blacksmith Rahair. He wants to introduce you to his Mercenary friends, from whom you’ll select one person to follow you around and fight by your side persistently, and another who’ll show up if you perform a specific action every 20 to 30 seconds. While the narrative will put you on Neyrelle’s trail immediately after opening the new Den hub area, <strong>we highly recommend pumping the brakes, getting the gang together before you do anything else</strong>.</p><p>That is to say, do the Mercenary missions first. One, because they’re narratively pretty excellent, somewhat akin to <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s Loyalty missions. The demon child Aldikin’s heartbreaking life after the death of his parents is the most affecting of them, and Subo is just a sneaky asshole, but the winner is Varyana, a cannibal barbarian crone with a score to settle. Just a quintessential tough old bird. She rules.</p><p>But two, the earlier you can start pumping Rapport XP into your mercs of choice and upgrade their support abilities, the better. The bottom tier abilities for all of these folks are invaluable in the later stretches of the DLC. Not to mention, eventually Rahair will move his daughter Fayira into the Den. Why’s that important? Well…</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5f6f7e462cd176a7bac6960ee8835a98" data-recommend-id="image://5f6f7e462cd176a7bac6960ee8835a98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cursed child." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cursed child." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f6f7e462cd176a7bac6960ee8835a98" data-recommend-id="image://5f6f7e462cd176a7bac6960ee8835a98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cursed child." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>….because Fayira will run the Barter store at the Den. We all know the town stores are hit and miss when it comes to legitimately good upgrades, but the Barter store at the Den is usually all killer, no filler. That’s especially true early on, where much of the available options will easily be +20 or better over whatever you’re currently wearing.</p><p>You also get to control when Fayira refreshes her stock—the first refresh is free, in fact–—and while that costs some of the Barter store’s currency, if you get caught out there in a tough activity, it’s the first place you want to go looking for some extra help. Plus, Fayira is a delight; the voice of a 9-year old Turkish street moppet, the soul of a 57-year-old New York bodega owner.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7c2904b37fa8180f6c4fffed25fc2f9" data-recommend-id="image://b7c2904b37fa8180f6c4fffed25fc2f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Calling for help." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Calling for help." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7c2904b37fa8180f6c4fffed25fc2f9" data-recommend-id="image://b7c2904b37fa8180f6c4fffed25fc2f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Calling for help." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Well, yes, this is a good rule for life in general, please look after your mental health—but in <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, that’s pretty literal. See, while there were a few very missable sidequests in the main game, where the solution to a puzzle involved the emote menu, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> puts a couple of these in your way during a couple of the critical path quests.</p><p>The earliest will come if you’re playing as Spiritborn. The Sacred Hunt quest has a step where they will literally have you calling to the spirits using the actual Help emote from your emote menu when prompted. And you’re definitely going to want to go after that one as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="33430415c20fd9e13decbaae9fb1da67" data-recommend-id="image://33430415c20fd9e13decbaae9fb1da67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Spirit Hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Spirit Hall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33430415c20fd9e13decbaae9fb1da67" data-recommend-id="image://33430415c20fd9e13decbaae9fb1da67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Spirit Hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There are, of course, those absolute maniacs who will do 80 hours of sidequests before going through the main campaign, and bless your hearts for your ambition. But if you’re using a Spiritborn character, and you’re at least at level 20, if you do literally nothing else in the campaign, make sure to hit the Sacred Hunt quest—it unlocks the Spirit Hall.</p><p>Hopefully by then, you have a good idea which abilities suit your personal style, so you can definitively pick which animal to specialize in, but there’s also a fringe benefit to keep in mind: Selecting a spirit also adds that animal class to every single skill you currently have. That creates some interesting synergies off the bat, allowing any attack to build Ferocity for Jaguar attacks or Resolve for Gorilla. It’s actually a good excuse, before you get too deep in the weeds on your skill tree, to go back, prune anything you aren’t using, and fine-tune things to get those passive abilities generating with every ability.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1628ccea12e8a73f453db1a13eaa42bd" data-recommend-id="image://1628ccea12e8a73f453db1a13eaa42bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1927" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Undercity." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Undercity." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1628ccea12e8a73f453db1a13eaa42bd" data-recommend-id="image://1628ccea12e8a73f453db1a13eaa42bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1927" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Undercity." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the most fun new activities in<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>Vessel of Hatred</em> involves the Undercity Dungeons, a procedurally generated speedrun through multiple levels of baddies for fun and profit. These things are absolutely swarming with unique baddies to put down, but this is one of the few areas of the game where you’ve got to suppress the instinct to kill everything with extreme prejudice.</p><p>There will be tough enemies marked with an hourglass on the map, who add time to the clock, and enemies marked with a skull who’ll power up the meter that gets you better rewards. Literally every other enemy you come across should be invisible in your eyes. Also, take your time in the starting circle to sneak a peek at the map of the floor, so you know in which direction you’re headed. If there are skull enemies marked on the map, and they’re not on your road, don’t take a detour, time runs down way too fast for that.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-2024-review-%E2%80%93-new-faces-old-blood.1002789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony's recent trend of remaking their past titles has made it difficult for me to recommend <em>Until Dawn 2024</em>. The original game is barely a decade old and is still playable today. Why did this title need a remake?</p>
<p>It's a question I kept asking even as I reached the credits on this fancy upgrade to the 2015 original. It is still the same story with the same characters in the same location with the same gameplay, but with a lot of its personality sanded down. The result is an experience with much higher production values, but lacking in spirit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-2024-mountain-sunset.jpg?itok=JlSo9R-E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-2024-mountain-sunset.jpg?itok=UVmFiLix 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>See you in about ten hours sun. Or not, depending on what happens.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Until Dawn 2024</em> Review – Coming Back To The Nightmare</h2>
<p>Broadly, <em>Until Dawn 2024</em> is a beat-for-beat retelling of the original story. You control eight teenagers vacationing in a cabin in the middle of the snowy Vancouver mountains. It just happens to be the same cabin where two of their friends mysteriously vanished one year ago to the day.</p>
<p>Naturally, between all the romantic drama and rampant hormones, the group is stalked by a serial killing maniac. Things get even more complicated as supernatural elements seep in, such as totems that provide glimpses into potential futures, and twisted monsters craving human flesh.</p>
<p><em>Until Dawn's</em> unique selling points were its branching narrative paths. What you say and do would lead to different outcomes in a scene. Characters could die if you were particularly reckless or sadistic. These choices branched out to multiple endings, including ones where everyone lives and everyone dies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-2024-chris-dialogue-choice.jpg?itok=UDYV2Tzw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-2024-chris-dialogue-choice.jpg?itok=nzX_DVQO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to see how the butterfly effect works.</figcaption></figure><p>What kept the original experience from becoming an overwhelming exercise in risk management was the campy, B-movie tone. It's a narrative that went right to the line of being fully self-aware while treating the immediate danger as seriously as possible.</p>
<p>In addition, the schlocky charm helped gloss over some narrative hiccups and red herrings. The first half of <em>Until Dawn</em> was dominated by random jumpscares and plot cul de sacs, all in service of hiding some major twists. It can make revisiting certain parts feel like needless padding, including several intense first-person therapy sections featuring a deliciously hammy Peter Stormare. But once the second half picks up, the game hits the rollercoaster highs of an intense, bloody slasher flick.</p>
<p>It's a formula so popular it became the foundation developer Supermassive Games' follow-ups to <em>Until Dawn</em>: <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-pictures-anthology-house-of-ashes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Dark Pictures</em></a> anthology and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Quarry</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Until Dawn 2024</em> does benefit from eight years of distance from the original release. The controls have been modernized and the UI has gotten an overhaul. There are even new accessibility options, providing aim assist, controller remapping, a ton of subtitle and closed caption options, a screen reader, and even a list of options for the game's various quick-time events. There is even an option for “Legacy” controls if you like the original layout.</p>

Don't breathe. Hell, stop your heart for a few seconds.</figcaption></figure><p>But the biggest improvement to <em>Until Dawn 2024's</em> gameplay is the Don't Move sections. There are scripted sections in the game where you must hold the controller as still as possible to avoid being detected. The problem with the original was the light bar sensor was extremely sensitive. If you weren't as still as a statue, you would fail.</p>
<p>In this new release, these sections are miles better. Now, your motion is visualized by a white pill in a box. If you move the controller, the box will glow red and break. If you move too much, the box falls apart and you fail the section. It's a fantastic quality-of-life improvement over the original release and helps keep the experience pulse-poundingly tense.</p>
<h2><em>Until Dawn 2024</em>&nbsp; Review – Cutting Out The Heart</h2>
<p>So why can't I recommend <em>Until Dawn 2024</em>? The core experience is the same and the welcome quality of life updates should make it a no-brainer right?</p>
<p>Well, the devil is in the details. The original <em>Until Dawn</em> had a strong visual identity. It reveled in its campy nature, confident in its genre trappings. Strong art direction and deliberate cinematography informed each section, adding to the atmosphere. On top of that, each chapter of the game was broken up by cheesy “previously on” story recaps. It made the whole experience feel like binging a DVD box set.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-2024-matt-and-deer-screenshot.jpg?itok=Z0_3wnoD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-2024-matt-and-deer-screenshot.jpg?itok=BuYSmrc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I have so many thoughts about the reframing of this scene, and they're not good.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Until Dawn 2024</em> keeps the narrative, but cuts out these artistic choices in favor of Sony's in-house prestige trappings. The camera is now locked behind the shoulder of whatever character you're playing. This shows off the remake's higher fidelity assets, but completely ruins the artistic framing of certain scenes. The original's foreboding color palette of sickly blue-green is gone in favor of photorealistic faces and elaborate lighting, homogenizing the game's aesthetic.</p>
<p>But the biggest changes are the framing of scenes. The most blatant is the game's opening. The interactivity of the scene is heavily scaled back. A key scene is now an elaborate montage with a licensed music needle drop, and ends with dramatic Dutch angles..As for the “previously on” recaps, they have been cut entirely and replaced with moody chapter titles that look like something out of a Mike Flanagan movie.</p>
<p>On paper, these are minor changes. But in practice it leads to an uncanny tone; a friction between camp and class that dampens the entire narrative.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-2024-hannah-washington.jpg?itok=uXO_9bwu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-2024-hannah-washington.jpg?itok=vEJ3kxe4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A first impression means a lot, a second first impression doubly so.</figcaption></figure><p>Credit where it's due, the re-imagined musical score by composer Mark Korven (<em>The Lighthouse</em>, <em>The Witch</em>) is great. Several strong themes and leitmotifs are now perfectly woven into the game's existing soundscapes, adding dramatic weight to proceedings and giving each character and location its own musical identity.</p>
<p>This brings me to the biggest issue with <em>Until Dawn 2024</em>: it is completely unnecessary if you've played the original. For research, I pulled up a playthrough of the PS4 original on a second screen while going through the remake to find any major changes or enhancements to the game's story.</p>
<p>Aside from some references to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review-headtrip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VR spin-off</a> titles and a sequel-tease, there is nothing of substance here. And in an industry where horror remakes either try to complement or improve on the original source material, it's a choice that makes a $60 price difficult to justify.</p>

<p><em>Until Dawn 2024</em> is an unnecessary remake. One that, despite sporting impressive visual updates and welcome quality-of-life improvements, retreads familiar ground. If you don't own a PlayStation 4 or are curious about these adaptational changes, this slick remake has some novelty. But if this isn't your first time in the snowy mountains with these teens, this return is not worth the full price.</p>

            <p>
Halo creators 343 Industries are having a bit of a glow-up. They're now calling themselves Halo Studios, a piece of rhetorical doubling-down that reminds me of those <a href="https://x.com/dril/status/1081617933074231296">dril tweets</a> about "James Bond, author of James Bond". They've also abandoned the proprietary Slipspace game engine used by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> in favour of Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which will be the basis for "multiple new games". To celebrate the occasion, Halo Studios have released some footage of Project Foundry, an expansive Unreal Engine 5 prototype and spawning vat for actual Halo games, which is billed by the Xbox Newswire as a kind of ur-Halo - "a true reflection of what would be required for a new Halo game using Unreal, and a training tool for how to get there".

<p>
Going by the Foundry video, what's required of a new Halo game using Unreal is essentially: much the same worlds, much the same props, much the same characters and enemies, but shinier and more detailed, with additional armour scratches and leaves and whatnot - perhaps a touch of bonus swazzle for your plasma sword, some stylishly worn edges for your pistol, a few more snowflakes for your snowdrift. Classic Next Gen larks. "The potential for Halo, right now, is huge", intones studio head Pierre Hintze at one point, against the backdrop of a developer pointing at a very small dent on Master Chief's ear.
</p>
<p>
New helmet dents aside, Halo Studios are switching to Unreal Engine 5 for some fairly straightforward practical reasons. One is that it saves them time creating, updating and maintaining their own tools - as the developers note, parts of the Slipspace engine are technically 25 years old, though I imagine the same is true of Unreal Engine's latest incarnations. In particular, the developers seemingly want to push out game updates at a faster rate than with Halo Infinite, which launched without certain features such as a proper splitscreen campaign and Forge mode (it never did get splitscreen in the end).
</p><p>
"We believe that the consumption habits of gamers have changed - the expectations of how fast their content is available," Hintze comments in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/">the Newswire piece</a>. "On Halo Infinite, we were developing a tech stack that was supposed to set us up for the future, and games at the same time." 
</p>
<p>
Another reason for the switchover is that it makes hiring and training new staff easier, because Unreal Engine is a popular middleware platform, and far more developers have experience with it than Slipspace.
</p>
<p>
There are a few specific Unreal Engine bells and whistles that Halo Studios aim to plug into Master Chief's headslot. "One of the primary things we're interested in is growing and expanding our world so players have more to interact with and more to experience," studio art director Chris Matthews explains in the Newswire piece. "Nanite and Lumen [Unreal's rendering and lighting technologies] offer us an opportunity to do that in a way that the industry hasn't seen before."
</p>
<p>
The Project Foundry video shows off three environments - a grassy, mountainous Pacific North West-inspired region reminiscent of both the original Halo and Halo Infinite, a frozen wonderland with some Forerunner stuff jutting out of it, and a world covered in the pustulant emissions of the Flood, Halo's xenomorphic third faction.
</p><p>
In the Newswire piece, Matthews adds that the developers want to avoid cultivating false expectations with Project Foundry. As such "everything we've made is built to the kind of standards that we need to build for the future of our games. We were very intentional about not stepping into tech demo territory. We built things that we truly believe in, and the content that we've built - or at least a good percentage of it - could travel anywhere inside our games in the future if we so desire it." 
</p>
<p>
Hintze insists that "our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects."
</p>
<p>
I guess all of this adds up from the perspective of managing future development of Halo games. I can see the utility of building a kind of totemic, central simulation, where novel breeds of Halo might take shape through idle experimentation, and where new developers can cut their teeth on the fundamentals.
</p>
<p>
Speaking as a once-devoted, now-lapsed Halo player, though, none of this makes me especially enthusiastic for the Halo games to come. It just feels like the usual exercise in More Graphics, covering up familiar triple-A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a>. I don't see unprecedented advances in promotional videos like these: I see a kind of desperate petrification, as though layer upon layer of embalming glitter were being applied to a mannequin that is slowly collapsing inwards.</p><p>As for renaming themselves "Halo Studios" - they're trying to start a new "chapter", as Hintze remarks, but taking the name of the series you've been working on for 17 years is like marrying your own reflection: it doesn't exactly suggest an appetite for new horizons. In the context of parent company Microsoft's on-going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">"restructuring for growth"</a>, it suggests a desire to play things safe and appease the mothership. Ah well, you'll always be 343 Industries in my heart, Halo Studios.

<p>Alien: Isolation released 10 years ago from Creative Assembly. Now, as Creative Assembly and creative director Al Hope reflects on the decade-old game, it has been confirmed that Alien: Isolation 2 is in development. </p>



<p>“When we started developing Alien: Isolation, we had one guiding principle: to create a truly authentic experience that went back to the roots of the Alien franchise – a new story capturing the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie masterpiece,” Hope said in a post on <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>. </p>



<p>“It’s been nothing short of incredible to witness your passion for the game over the years and see it reach so many players around the world.”</p>



<p>He then dropped the bombshell that fans of the game have been eagerly awaiting.</p>



<p>“On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear,” he said. “Today, I’m delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to Alien: Isolation is in early development.”</p>



<p>Whether the game is called Alien: Isolation 2 or something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">else remains to be seen.</a> It’s also unknown when more information on the sequel will be announced. All that was said is that details will come from the studio when they’re ready. Either way, it’s news certain to make fans of the game excited.</p>



<p>You can see Hope’s full statement below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>To our fans around the world:</strong></p>



<p>It’s hard to believe that it has been 10 years since we embarked on our journey with the release of Alien: Isolation.</p>



<p>When we started developing Alien Isolation, we had one guiding principle: to create a truly authentic experience that went back to the roots of the Alien franchise – a new story capturing the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie masterpiece.</p>



<p>It’s been nothing short of incredible to witness your passion for the game over the years and see it reach so many players around the world. Your boundless enthusiasm, excitement, screams (!) and steely courage in the face of cinema’s greatest killer, have been profoundly rewarding.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a nightmare mode veteran or stepping into Amanda Ripley’s shoes for that thrilling first attempt (good luck!), we wanted to express our deep gratitude. It was a dream project brought to life by a brilliant team, and the reception you have given it over the years is extraordinary.</p>



<p>On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear.</p>



<p>Today, I’m delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to Alien: Isolation is in early development.<br>We look forward to sharing more details with you when we’re ready.</p>



<p>Once again, thank you.</p>



<p>Until next time,</p>



<p>Al Hope, Creative Director – Alien: Isolation</p>

                <p>Bethesda's Fallout games have been focused on what happened in America after a nuclear war devastated the planet. However, unofficial fan creations like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/2300-6464738/" data-ref-id="2300-6464738">Fallout London</a> can offer glimpses of the world beyond America's borders. Now, there's a new mod on the horizon called Fallout: Nuevos Mexico, which may give players another country to explore in this post-apocalyptic era.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoh5HxjV81M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zoh5HxjV81M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer is in Spanish, but when the captions are turned on, an English translation appears. The speaker is a woman who openly has contempt for "those from the north, with their shiny armor and stories of greatness." The woman doesn't share her identity, but she does reveal that she runs a drug cartel and has no apologies to offer for any of it. The trailer also hints that some of the captives at her villa are being viscously butchered, and possibly eaten.</p><p>The Fallout: Nuevo Mexico mod is currently being made by a team led by Zapshock, and it is not affiliated with Bethesda in any way. In a post on YouTube, Zapshock writes, "The following content has been created with the intention of representing a dark, fictional reality inspired by the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout. It does not seek to glorify or idolize acts of violence committed by criminal groups, but rather to highlight the dangers of a devastated world."</p><p>According to Zapshock, Mexico City will be the biggest hub in Fallout: Nuevo Mexico, but the mod is far from finished. There's currently no timeframe for the mod's release, but it will exclusively be available for PC when it is ready.</p>

The first two days are reserved for professionals (people working in the video game industry, journalists, etc.), while the last two days (the weekend) are open to the public. Around 250,000 people attend the event each year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m writing this article to reflect on the mistakes I made and the things I would do differently if I had the chance to do it again. If it can help others, even better!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hopefully, you’ll find the information you’re looking for!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How to Register for TGS"><span>How to Register for TGS</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From what I understand, there are three ways to attend TGS:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Get invited to the "80 Selected Indie":</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> You just need to apply by presenting your game. If your game is selected by the jury, you will be invited and given a booth in the&nbsp; "80 Selected Indie" section. I feel like this is the best option: you get a free booth, and your game is highlighted by TGS.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Join a delegation that's attending:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I noticed that several countries were represented (Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, etc.). I’m not sure how it works exactly, but there might be opportunities where the price and professional connections make it worth it. Some delegations have their own stands with featured games, while others just attend in the business area.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pay for a booth (around $1000):</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This is what I did. It allows you to get a space in the indie game area, which you can customize according to your needs.</span><br></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For my part, I tried to get invited to the "80 Selected Indie," but I wasn’t chosen... Since I really wanted to attend the event, I opted to pay for a booth instead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I didn’t know it at the time, but a French delegation was present. Maybe I could have joined them, but I’m not sure if I would have been accepted, given that I’m probably not yet professional enough in the industry.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Organizing with TGS"><span>Organizing with TGS</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m describing my experience as someone who paid for a booth to participate in TGS. I’m not sure how it works if you attend in another way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once your registration is confirmed, TGS gives you access to three online platforms:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To manage the organization of your booth.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To arrange meetings with the press (this access becomes available about 1.5 to 2 months before TGS).</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To arrange meetings with professionals (this access also becomes available about 1.5 to 2 months before TGS).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The platform to organize your booth"><span>The platform to organize your booth</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It seems intimidating at first. You’re given access to a 200-page PDF that provides all the information you need. It gave me a headache at first, and with all that information, I wasn’t even sure if I could bring my own equipment… But in fact, you can! Despite the lengthy process you have to follow, you actually have a lot of freedom in organizing your booth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are many forms to fill out, some mandatory and some optional. Deadlines are always indicated, and you’ll receive email reminders as the deadlines approach. The forms cover everything from renting computer equipment to having food delivered to your booth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, it was overwhelming to handle all this information while also preparing the game demo. I ended up filling out the forms close to their deadlines. However, the best approach, in my opinion, would be to dedicate one or two days to complete all the necessary forms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep in mind that depending on your requests, you may incur additional costs (such as renting equipment).</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">But if you panic like I did, don’t worry! You can always email the TGS contacts, and they respond quickly and clearly. They were very efficient in helping me.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Platforms for organizing press/professional meetings"><span>Platforms for organizing press/professional meetings</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You get access to two separate platforms: one for the press and one for professionals. These platforms allow you to see who’s attending and send invitations with proposed meeting times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here are two mistakes I made and what to avoid:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time zone difference:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> When I scheduled my meetings, I didn’t realize that the platform was displaying French time… So I ended up scheduling meetings for the middle of the night &gt;&lt;. Make sure to double-check the time zone when scheduling!</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are two distinct platforms:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> One for the press and one for professionals. I only realized this a week before TGS! I managed to catch up by sending invitations, but it was a bit of a scramble. Avoid the panic by familiarizing yourself with both platforms early on.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also saw another matching app for professional meetings, but it wasn’t affiliated with TGS. I’m not sure how well it works.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding contact through the platforms, I received more responses from professionals.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">I sent many messages to journalists but only got a few replies.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Organizing meetings and the booth"><span>Organizing meetings and the booth</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was missing a lot of things here, as I wasn’t well-prepared and lacked equipment.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">One of my main challenges was traveling from France; it seemed a bit complicated to bring lots of equipment to decorate my booth.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">But in fact, most people traveling from afar bring a suitcase full of decorations for their booth… whereas I was a bit unprepared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Business cards:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">You need a good amount of business cards. Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough, so I ran out in the last two days. Ideally, I recommend having cards with English on one side and Japanese on the other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flyers:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">You’ll need flyers to hand out during TGS, written in both Japanese and English. Goodies are also a good idea.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Decorations:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">You’re free to decorate your booth however you like. Since I didn’t have much, I just printed large images of the game from a convenience store... Honestly, don’t do it like that ^^''. If you can bring quality materials, pack them in a large suitcase.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Professional networking events"><span>Professional networking events</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After each business day, you’re invited to an event with unlimited food and drinks.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">It’s well-organized and a great opportunity to meet new people in the industry.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">All the speeches were in Japanese, so I couldn’t fully appreciate that part...</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The first evening</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> takes place in a hotel hall right next to the TGS venue (a 10-minute walk). It feels a bit fancy, but you can come in casually. It was a great experience since I got to chat with other indie devs. I didn’t try the food, so I can’t comment on that, but you only get one invite for this event. If you want to bring more people, you’ll need to pay for additional tickets. I noticed that many indie devs weren’t there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The second evening</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> invites everyone present during the business days. Unfortunately, I didn’t really enjoy it since we were exhausted and had two more long days ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you still have energy and motivation, I think these two events are great opportunities to make professional contacts. The second evening seems more casual, but I left early, so my opinion might not be entirely accurate.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Public days"><span>Public days</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These are the two busiest days (nearly 100,000 people per day). Be prepared to be on your feet non-stop from 11 am to 5 pm. Ideally, you should plan to have 3 to 4 people rotating shifts. We were only two, so there was no time to take breaks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s helpful if you can describe your game a bit in Japanese. I regret that my Japanese skills were weak, which made conversations challenging. I often had to refer people to a small description sheet I had prepared in advance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marketing methods can be a bit surprising...</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Having attended conventions in France, we tend to be more passive and let visitors come to us. Here, however, don’t hesitate to engage with visitors more actively, hand them a flyer, and introduce your game. Of course, don’t be pushy, but you’ll quickly sense if you’re bothering someone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s not the most fun thing to do, but without it, you might miss some opportunities to showcase your game. Sometimes it pays off because people genuinely appreciate your work!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for me, I made the mistake of not making flyers... I only had stickers, and they didn’t even have the name of the game on them.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">In short, I completely messed up on that front. Plan to have between 500 and 1000 flyers, I think it’s entirely possible to hand them all out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Would I attend the Tokyo Game Show again?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, I really enjoyed the experience... But I would definitely bring more people next time. I regret not being able to explore more of the event, especially since some of the larger booths were truly impressive (particularly those from the big companies).</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">However, it’s also very exhausting, and I think taking a day off out of the four would help to stay more effective.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So that was my experience at the Tokyo Game Show as an indie developer! I presented my game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dagada's Story</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a puzzle-platformer inspired by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yoshi's Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I aim to recreate the game feel of the Super Nintendo era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feel free to follow me on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/Maluska19">social media</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and wishlist the project on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859390/Dagadas_Story/">Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">!</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">If you have any questions about TGS or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">またね!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> is set to make its Steam debut, marking the start of Ubisoft's full return to Valve's PC storefront.</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">new releases are set to launch day one on Steam</a>, starting with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on 14th February next year.</p>
<p>But, before that, Steam users will also be able to get their hands on Assassin's Creed Mirage, which was initially released back in October last year across consoles and PC (but not via Steam).</p>

<p>"Welcome to Baghdad, 9th century. Discover the powerful coming-of-age story of Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions seeking answers and justice," reads a post from Ubisoft on the game's freshly-minted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"Join an ancient organisation and come to understand a new creed – one that will change Basim’s fate in ways he never could have imagined."</p>
<p>Ubisoft hasn't set a firm date for Mirage's Steam release, merely stating it will be arriving at some point later this month. It is available to add to wishlists now, however.</p>

<p>While Ubisoft has made a habit in recent years of not releasing its games on Steam from the off, other titles have eventually made their way to the storefront in the end. For example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> and city-building strategy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a> eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-valhalla-headed-to-steam">arrived on the platform back in 2022</a>, having previously been available elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you are yet to play Assassin's Creed Mirage for yourself, be sure to check out our review, where Christian Donlan called it "a rich and characterful adventure", awarding it four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"Through the warmth of familiar rituals returning after those bigger, rangier games, I get to see what's really special about this series, what it takes to create, perhaps, and what it can give us in return," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My main foray into Coover has been in the form of his two hefty novels about unions and cults, 1966’s <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-origin-of-the-brunists-robert-coover/12484159?ean=9780802137432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Origin of the Brunists</a></em> and its 2014 sequel, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-brunist-day-of-wrath-robert-coover/7775915?ean=9781945814518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Brunist Day of Wrath</a>.</em></p><p>I’ll admit to not quite being through <em>Wrath</em>, which at over 1000 pages is twice as long as <em>Origin</em>. I’m not one to shy away from a long book, but both feel longer than their page count thanks to one of the qualities I admire most about them: practically every character gets explored in-depth, with the narrative going off on tangents and digressions until it’s hard to remember what was happening in the main plot at all. Both books focus on the fictional town of West Condon, where a mine explosion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Frankfort,_Illinois#1947_coal_mine_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired by true events </a>traps nearly 100 workers inside. The only survivor is Giovanni Bruno, and as the town reels to make sense of the disaster, a cult springs up around him, with the movement ultimately predicting the end of the world.</p><p><em>Origin </em>explores the formation of the cult and its effect on the town, while <em>Wrath</em> focuses on what happens after their prophecy fails. (<em>Origin</em> starts on the night of the apocalypse, so it’s pretty obvious the prediction doesn’t come to pass; but as Coover writes in <em>Wrath</em>, “For the rest of the world, the end might not have come that day, but for West Condon, it surely did.”) Bruno isn’t a very charismatic leader, spending much of his rise to fame in a coma; instead, he’s uplifted by different townspeople and their reactions to the mine disaster, with a swirling universe of supporters and detractors giving meaning to his every gesture and look. All of this is followed by Justin “Tiger” Miller, a high school basketball hero turned reporter, who covers the Brunists for the local paper. Coover writes of Miller’s return to town, “he keeps going soft just when you expect the best of him… [W]hile most people saw his return to take over the<em> Chronicle</em> as a heroic kind of yea-saying, if not indeed an act of grace, there were those, even then, who wondered if Tiger might not simply have run out of wind out there in the world and returned to rest up awhile in a place where heroism was still possible without sticking to training rules.”</p><p>It’s hard for me not to root for a journalist protagonist, and we see Miller get sucked into everyone in town’s drama. He’s also a vector for the stuff I like the least about <em>Origin</em>: long narrative wanders into relationships and sex scenes that must have seemed transgressive when it was written, but felt off-putting and dated to me today. But a good thing about <em>Origin</em> is that there’s so much <em>stuff </em>&nbsp;in it that it’s easy to find something to like, which for me was how broadly and honestly Coover explores both the internal and external expression of religion.</p><p>Some characters who come to follow Bruno are earnestly religious, or they reject him because of conflicting religious conviction. Others get swept up through more earthly avenues, like their anger at the mining company or through their relationship to other followers. Coover paints a fascinating picture of how a belief takes hold and spreads, how a feeling becomes a movement and how a movement becomes an organization. By giving every character time on the page, Coover creates a complicated web of followers, where the cult isn’t just “<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-cults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cult</a>,” but characters the reader knows and cares about. We see how religion intersects with the real world: how the faith connects to West Condon’s decline or to the union's internal politics or to the ways the town’s church doesn’t meet everyone’s needs or to how, as, <em>Wrath</em> puts it, “for the mine company fat cats the disaster wasn’t nothing more than one bad hand.” Coover never makes a call on if anyone is “right” or “wrong,” instead letting everyone speak for themselves until the reader is faced with a chorus of religion, politics, romance, and labor.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels like Coover <em>loves</em> these characters, even the most incidental. While reading, I speculated that he knew the name and story of literally everyone in his fictional town. While I think he falls prey to one of the harder things to resist as a fiction writer–getting enamoured with your backstories and putting them all in the book, even if the book doesn’t strictly need them–telling the story in this way is clearly the literary project he’s on. Coover has a character think in <em>Wrath</em> that “The world, someone has said, is a book written by the hand of God in which every creature is a word charged with meaning,” and that definitely seems to be how Coover himself feels. He balances the individual with the group eloquently, or zooms from a close third person to an omniscient narrator while skillfully staying out of the reader's way. Even in one more zoomed-out passage of <em>Origin</em>, he still keeps things hugely specific:</p><blockquote><p>And so, tonight, fathers worry about their daughters, wives about their husbands, ministers about their flocks, doctors about their patients, Brunists about how they will meet the End, doubters about the truth, the mayor about the embarrassment and the shame and the next elections, businessmen about the slump and miners about unemployment, children about their aging parents, just about all West Condoners worry a moment or two, unless they have dropped off blissfully before the TV, about their health or their virility or their weight or their period or their happiness or when and how they’re going to die.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p><em>Origin</em> is a tough book to get through, especially with its giant cast and wandering story and some of its datedness. Though <em>Wrath</em> was published in 2014, it still keeps some of the same tone that I'd hoped was a product of <em>Origin</em>'s time, but this feels clearly like the literary school Coover is in. Coover’s passing has inspired me to get back to it, though; the world of West Condon and the Brunists is so strange and unique and thoughtful, stuffed in such an unlikely way with so many of the things I’m interested in. It's so full that there’s surely something for you there if you stick with it. Reading, I can feel Coover’s love of not just his world but the world in general, of the people who live in it and the stories they tell themselves and each other. As he writes in <em>Origin</em>,</p><blockquote><p>West Condon came alive as Miller walked through it. First day of spring and, on impulse, he’d decided to leave the Chevy at home, walk to the <em>Chronicle</em>. Still needed the trenchcoat, but he wore it open. Women appeared to sweep porches, men laughed foolishly from autos, children ran and shouted. Bicycles bounced down off porches. He heard the whump-whump of a basketball bouncing on cinders. The cool rains of the last couple days had sunk a fragrance into the soil that the sudden vernal sun this Saturday morning exploited gaudily. Who would think some here saw an end to it all?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An Alien: Isolation sequel is currently in early development, the original game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of one of the best games inspired by the long-running franchise, Alien: Isolation Creative Director Al Hope shared a new message on <a href="https://x.com/alienisolation/status/1843305291322200488">social media</a>, talking about Creative Assembly's desire to create a new story that would capture the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie while thanking players for their continued support since the game's release back in 2014. At the end of the message, which can be read in full below, Hope confirmed that a sequel is in early development and that more information on this game will be revealed when the team is ready to talk more about it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Alien-Isolation-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>Following its original release in 2014, Alien: Isolation was ported first to Nintendo Switch in 2019 and to mobile devices in <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-is-coming-to-mobile-on-december-16/">2021</a>. Despite the technical limitations of the Nintendo console, the port turned out great, giving more players the chance to experience one of the best games based on the franchise ever made, as we highlighted in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alien-isolation-switch-authentic-alien-adventure/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Alien Isolation is an essential horror game, and the Nintendo Switch version might even be the very best place to play it, as long as you can ignore the caveats mentioned above. With excellent picture and audio quality, thick atmosphere, and a beautiful aesthetic, it is one of the most interesting licensed games ever released, and a great stealth horror title to enjoy.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alien-isolation-sequel-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and developer Creative Assembly have announced that an<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>sequel is in the works, just as the survival horror game hits its tenth anniversary.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>creative director Al Hope says that witnessing players' "passion" for&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>has been "nothing short of incredible" over the past ten years.</p>
<p>He says he and his team are filled with "deep gratitude" for the way players have appreciated the game over the years, and that <i>Isolation&nbsp;</i>is a "dream project brought to life by a brilliant team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alien-isolation-sequel-android.jpg?itok=7-2Soe6W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alien-isolation-sequel-android.jpg?itok=YYEjO23K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a followup.</figcaption></figure><p>Hope closes his message of thanks by announcing that fans' "distress calls" have been heard, and that an&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>sequel is currently in development at Creative Assembly.</p>
<p>Right now, the project is in its early stages, so it's unlikely we'll hear more about it for a while. Hope says he and his team will share more details with players "when we're ready", so don't expect news imminently.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that a followup to&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is on the way at all should be cause for celebration; it's been a long ten years since the original, and once again getting to hide in lockers in terror of the Xenomorph discovering us is an exciting prospect.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation</em>, it's a survival horror game set aboard a space station called Sevastopol, and it serves as a direct sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>movie.</p>

<p>The game follows the story of Amanda Ripley, daughter of iconic space mechanic Ellen, as she attempts to discover the truth behind the disappearance of her mother.</p>
<p>Many&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>games, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/aliens-fireteam-elite"><em>Fireteam Elite</em></a>, focus on action, but&nbsp;<em>Isolation&nbsp;</em>asks you to evade and outrun the Xenomorph, distract it so you can solve puzzles, and generally avoid confronting it if you can help it.</p>
<p>We still don't know much about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>sequel, but we'll bring you more on it as soon as we get it. In the meantime, you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/alien-isolation-review">review of the original</a> from way back in the mists of 2014 to refresh your memory!</p>

Instead of choosing a player class, by equipping two different types of weapons you earn both the active and passive skills of each, letting you create hybrid builds that can be a hell of a lot of fun to experiment with.<br></p><p>The best build is always going to be the one you have the most fun with, of course, and any combination of weapons is <em>viable</em> for clearing content if built and played well. But some combinations are better than others, leading to the inevitable metas—to give you an idea of what’s working best for many players at the moment, here are some of the most commonly used builds known for being top-tier.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-recommend-id="image://46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sword and shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sword and shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-recommend-id="image://46b52cded3eb947c70c1b597c7d11a54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sword and shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You might imagine sword plus sword is a bit of a redundant pick, but by combining the Sword &amp; Shield with the Greatsword, you can become the ultimate ass-kicking tank. This build allows you to not only mitigate damage exceptionally well with various defensive skills, but you also dish out the hurt using the Greatsword’s hard-hitting abilities. With the right setup, this can also be one of the best farming builds, letting you gather tons of enemies and DPS them down rapidly.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> A combination of the Sword &amp; Shield + Wand &amp; Tome turns you into a traditional paladin archetype, granting you substantial sustain via healing spells, while offering up some damage-over-time abilities. If raw survivability is your goal, this build is calling your name.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-recommend-id="image://924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wandy goodness." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wandy goodness." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-recommend-id="image://924cc4621f9eeb381ddd9bfa00ff583f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wandy goodness." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s essentially impossible to beat the type of healing you can achieve by using a Wand &amp; Tome with a Staff. You’ll bring some decent damage alongside being able to spam single-target and AOE healing spells to keep your party alive through just about anything. Even better, this combo is also incredible for farming due to a mixture of both weapons’ AOE spells, making it one of the most versatile builds in the game.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> The Wand &amp; Tome with the Longbow turns you into a utility class. Though you may be missing a bit of the synergy found in the Wand &amp; Tome + Staff build, you’ll nevertheless be a useful addition to your party with high damage, passive and active buffs, and off-healing capabilities.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-recommend-id="image://cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eye-demon stares at players." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An eye-demon stares at players." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-recommend-id="image://cac39b39a46e64a33f29dc129baa9861" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An eye-demon stares at players." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If dishing out consistently high damage with an enjoyable rotation is your cup of tea, you won’t want to sleep on the Greatsword and Dagger combo. Because you cannot sleep on a cup of tea. The high damage from your Greatsword abilities mix beautifully with the critical hit increases offered from the Daggers, and their passive skills complement each other perfectly. Whether you’re looking to melt bosses or be a pest in PVP encounters, you won’t find a better all-arounder in the melee space.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> Using the Greatsword with the Wand &amp; Tome—this can also be a viable option if you enjoy AOE farming using crowd control, though it’s not always ideal for single-target engagements. Even so, it can be a lot of fun to round up tons of enemies and burn them down while keeping your health topped off with ease.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-recommend-id="image://de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Big ol lion-face getting shot at by a puny crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Big ol lion-face getting shot at by a puny crossbow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-recommend-id="image://de1d9bced1c6bd5073bad03489f54a41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Big ol lion-face getting shot at by a puny crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’d like the best single-target damage available in the game, look no further than the overwhelming power of the Crossbow and Dagger combo. Using a near-constant stream of attacks against your foes lets you rack up DPS at rates unseen on other classes, and the mixture of melee and ranged skills results in a thrilling rotation that often feels like a deadly dance.<br></p><p><strong>Also consider:</strong> The Longbow and Staff combo ranks as one of the most deadly builds in the game as well, letting you utterly nuke enemies with fireballs, lightning, and flurries of arrows. This is the definition of a class cannon build, and it’s definitely the way to go if you’d prefer to avoid any melee attack requirements showing up in your rotation.</p><hr><p>With all of that out of the way, make sure you also check out our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-mmo-ncsoft-how-to-get-started-1851665601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-mmo-ncsoft-how-to-get-started-1851665601">tips for getting started in <em>Throne and Liberty</em></a></span>.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
