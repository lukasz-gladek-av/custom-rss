            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Civilization is a series in thrall to the illusion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth">endless incremental progress</a>, and what more bruisingly poetic way to refute that narrative than by sticking two fingers up at this year's ailing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> and opting to play 2016's much better-regarded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> instead. Conveniently, you can currently get Civilization 6 for free on the Epic Games Store - the giveaway runs till 24th July.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're mad about Civ 7's failings, there's a fair chance you already own Civ 6. But the freebie does include access to all of the game's DLC and expansions, so might be worth bagging if you only ever bought the base game from a different store. For clarity, you do not need to stick two fingers up at Civ 7 while downloading the free version of Civ 6. It is a piece of software and cannot respond to your hatred.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">The Epic Games Store giveaway</a> is for Civ 6's Platinum Edition, which includes the Vikings Scenario Pack, the Poland Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Persia and Macedon Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, and the Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, plus two big expansions: Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm.</p>
<p>After all the yelling, shouting, explosions and assorted farmyard noises in response to Civilization 7, it is kind of terrifying to revisit Adam Smith's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-6-review">Civilization 6 review</a> from 2016. "Civ VI demands flexibility of thought and function, and it rewards it handsomely with a game that responds elegantly to all kinds of different playstyles," he wrote, concluding that "it is, quite simply, a thing of wonder, and a late contender for my personal game of the year." </p>
<p>It was subsequently consecrated as RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-4x-2016-civilization-6">best 4X of 2016 in the year's Advent Calendar</a>, and stands firm (appropriately) at 6th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">best PC strategy games</a>. (You all ranked it at 13th on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">own list</a> because what is the average RPS reader if not a chuckling contrarian.)</p>
<p>I want to go back. Still, perhaps with enough updating and patching, Civ 7 will shine similarly. Civilization tends to play the long game, after all. The next major update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">will add auto-exploration for scouts and smoothed-out Age transitions</a>. It feels like if they can figure out the controversy over the Age mechanic, the rest might fall into place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-youve-given-up-on-civilization-7-civ-6-is-free-with-all-dlc-expansions-for-a-limited-time-on-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s another new trailer! Look, I’m not going to pretend at professional distance here: I am extremely excited about next month’s new TV series, <em>Alien: Earth</em>. And each new trailer gives me more reason to be. But this isn’t because I think the <em>Alien</em> franchise is some surefire hit generator—goodness gracious it isn’t—but because it’s from Noah Hawley, and I suspect it’s going to be really, <em>really </em>weird.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197589" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Noah Hawley is perhaps best known for his TV reinterpretation of the Coen Bros. movie <em>Fargo</em>, but the reason I’m so thrilled he’s behind <em>Alien: Earth</em> is because of his 2017-19 show, <em>Legion</em>.</p><p>It’s hard to convey <em>Legion</em>’s brilliance in words, given so much of this unique take on the world of superpowers existed in the most astonishingly vivid visual flourishes. It was also the most extraordinary take on what was, after all, an X-Men story, despite never uttering those words, nor even alluding to the wider franchise. The story of David Haller (Dan Stevens), the schizophrenic son of Charles Xavier (although he is never named either), explored his attempts to come to terms with his powers and his mental illness, accompanied by the unknowable reality of Aubrey Plaza’s Lenny, all while being pursued by the astoundingly sinister Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban). It was like nothing else on TV. (The above is a genuine scene from the TV show, not a compilation or trailer. It was this fantastic.) And <em>that</em>’s why I’m so hyped for <em>Alien: Earth</em>.</p><p>Hints of the possible weirdness have appeared throughout the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional campaign</a></span> for the series, not least a full three minutes of a cat’s eye view of a Weyland-Yutani ship:</p><p>But somewhat less overtly, there have been multiple trailers featuring shots so distinctive from Hawley’s shows; sparse, symmetrical spaces, intercutting shots of idyllic nature with barren, metallic greys. There’s so much potential here for headfuckery, peculiar flashbacks/forwards that can sit unexplained for episodes at a time, and visual flare that will speak far more potently than the scripts.</p><p>Or, of course, it could be terrible. No one knows yet. But I have such high hopes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">Last month we had a trailer</a></span> that stopped holding back and introduced us to the idea that the the Weyland ship that crashes into an North America’s Prodigy City isn’t just carrying a Xenomorph, but at least four other alien species. One of them looks like a Metroid. Another is the cutest little evil octopus.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-recommend-id="image://b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-recommend-id="image://b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We also learned that this 2120-set show, taking place a couple of years before the events of the original 1979 <em>Alien</em> film, has a program in which human consciousnesses are transferred into synthetic bodies, and throughout the earlier trailer, there were hints that this will cause issues for those minds: perfect Hawley territory for unreliable narration and ambiguity over reality.</p><p>This latest trailer at first seems to be something of a best-of of what’s come before, but in fact subtly moves ideas forward a step. The young girl whose mind is transferred into a synth body—she’s not questioning her humanity. The alien creatures we know have escaped on board the crashed ship? We now see their eggs, their victims, and a whole lot more blood. And most of all, if you’re me and geeking out about this, we see a constant flip-flopping between sci-fi metallic horror and comfortable, Earthly bucolic nature. Right up until that final shot, the incredibly subtle yet striking image of a Xenomorph lit by natural light.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When did you last see a Xenomorph lit by natural light?</p><p>Oh, and talking of progression between the trailers, we need to talk about the poor goat.

Not least, based on this being set two years before the original movie, you’re forced to wonder how much was known about the Xenomorphs ahead of Ripley’s first encounter in 2122. Now, forgive me, because I’m no expert in this franchise (obviously <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are masterpieces in their own distinct ways, but the rest of the movies really don’t bear all that much scrutiny in my opinion), but I’ve tried to piece this all together. And for the record, the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> movies are not canon, as Ridley Scott made sure of by the story he told in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p><p>2012's <em>Prometheus </em>was set in 2093, at which point it’s made clear that Xenomorphs are yet to exist. <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, released in 2017, is set in 2104, just 16 years before this TV show, and now—as a result of experiments with fungal spores on an alien planet—it seems they do. But they’re nowhere near Earth, and it’s unclear whether or not anyone could have reported back about them. The next chronological movie is <em>Alien</em>, which of course was not created to be part of some enormous franchise spanning the timeline in either direction, and so gave no thought to where or why the Xenomorphs existed. But it <em>does</em> reveal that the as-yet unnamed corporation had deliberately sent the Nostromo out to encounter the aliens.</p><p>So, this all suggests that <em>Alien: Earth</em> is going to explain how Weyland-Yutani knew to go look for the buggers: they literally encountered them on the planet’s surface. That’s quite a twist! It also leaves huge questions about those other four species! Why have we never encountered any of these again in the <em>four</em> other films that take place after <em>Alien</em>? Obviously <em>Aliens</em> takes care of itself, in its own contained story, but what about <em>Romulus</em>? That’s set on a Weyland experimental ship, but here they’re only focused on the Xenos. And sure, the more we can forget <em>Alien 3</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em> the better, but the latter is set another 200 years later on and <em>still</em> doesn’t suggest other lifeforms are out there.</p><p>It’s obviously tempting to just say, “Dude, who cares? It’s a sci-fi story and they’re just making shit up as they go.” And yes, that’s absolutely true. But people take canon and continuity <em>really</em> seriously, especially in nerdcore like this. It would, I think, be a bit lazy to set a TV show in such a crucial moment in the mythos’ history and act like what comes next isn’t important. It seems very unlikely that’s the plan. Hence why it’s so interesting to speculate!</p><p>The show is going to be on FX and Hulu, starting August 12 with two episodes. After that, it’ll come out on a weekly schedule, like TV used to in the olden days, with eight episodes total finishing on September 23.</p><p>Clearly I’m way too excited for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-tv-series-trailer-scott-1851786549]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-5-years-in-development-the-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-tv-series-is-happening.1247514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The long-running video game series Assassin's Creed will get a live-action TV series adaptation. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-news-1236318387/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> report that Netflix has greenlit the series after years of development hell; the intention to produce the series was <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-1234816203/">announced</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>The series had been through multiple creative teams even before it was greenlit, but Netflix settled on two co-showrunners. Roberto Patino, a writer on FX's <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> and HBO's <em>Westworld</em>, will join David Wiener, who led Paramount+'s <em>Halo</em> TV series as well as&nbsp;<em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>.</p>
<p>The two released a joint statement with the news that the show is moving forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been fans of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story—about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it’s about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We’ve got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we’re committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not many details are known about the series, beyond the obvious: like the games, it will follow a shadow war between the rival Templars and Assassins factions fought across centuries and cultures, with characters diving into genetic memory to experience the lives of ancestors who played pivotal roles in the war. There are no public details about characters or casting.</p>

                <p>Donkey Kong Bananza is now available, and it appears to be a hit for the Nintendo Switch 2. But longtime fans of other Nintendo platformers like Mario Odyssey may have noticed that something feels ... a little off? Out of place? You can't quite put your finger on it, but something is wrong <em>when you put your fingers on it</em>. It's the jump button.</p><p>For DK Bananza, the jump button has been uncharacteristically mapped to the A button by default on the Switch 2, as opposed to the more traditional B button. This is mainly so that the face buttons map to the directions DK punches: X button for upward, Y button for forward, B button for downward. It makes enough sense. But going back to the days of the Super Nintendo, the jump button has almost always been on the bottom of the "diamond" shape of face buttons. So if you just want jumping to feel normal again, there is a way to do that.</p><p>From the start menu, go to the fourth menu in a row--Options, with a gear icon--and scroll down to the "DK's Action Buttons" submenu. There you have the option to switch the B/A functions from "Punch downward / Jump" to "Jump / Punch downward." It's not full button mapping but it shows Nintendo recognized that some players might feel more at home with the traditional jump button placement. The downside is that the punch directions no longer correspond to their placements on the face buttons.</p><p>This has inspired something of a debate around the GameSpot offices, with some swearing by the default control scheme and others finding it too strange to get used to. Personal tastes will vary, so we won't tell you how to live your life. As the reviewer, I spent almost 20 hours with the default control scheme and it feels perfectly natural to me, but others say they changed the control scheme early and got used to not having the face buttons mapped directly to your punch direction.</p><p>No matter how you play it, DK Bananza is a raucous good time. "As part of the launch lineup for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo's signature substantial single-player adventures," I wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>. "But more importantly, it's an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo's best recent work."</p>

This sound was attached to hundreds of videos on my feed before I ever actually saw one of these dolls, but now that the trend has broken containment, I see one of these little guys everywhere I look. Though Labubu were initially just dolls like any other, they’ve seen an uptick as a fashion accessory in the past couple of years, with Lisa, one of the members of K-pop group Blackpink, being cited as one of the major trendsetters who’s sparked the brand’s worldwide success.</p><p>Lisa has been considered one of the first trailblazers for the brand ever since she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted photos of herself sporting a Labubu keychain on her bag</a></span> on social media in April 2024, and then other huge celebrities followed suit. Artists like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa </a></span>have also been spotted with these little monsters hanging off their bags, and over the past year the dolls have exploded in popularity. It may seem like Labubu is an overnight success, but the dolls have been in production for a decade. The brand was introduced in 2015 under the company How2Work, based on a character design by artist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasing Lung</a></span>, who illustrated children’s books with the company. The brand had another surge in popularity in 2019 when it started collaborating with Pop Mart, a Chinese blind box store. All of this was a perfect storm for Labubu to become not only a worldwide phenomenon, but the kind of collectathon craze that rivals something like <em>Pokémon </em>cards. How do you make something desirable? Make it harder to find. It’s also made unboxing videos a popular viral trend as people try to track down the rare “secret” doll in a blind box.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The craze has grown so much that Labubu is now collaborating with some huge brands.

                <p>A lot of Fortnite's most memorable moments have come from the game's live events, where everybody playing is experiencing some kind of one-time-only content that you just had to be there for. The very first Fortnite live event, the one that started this whole awesome tradition, was the Blast Off event at the end of Chapter 1 Season 4--and, hey, guess what, it's coming for the end of Fortnite OG Season 4. The new version of this rocket party will go down on July 26 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET during any ongoing rounds of Fortnite OG. Check out the teaser.</p><p>The Blast Off event originally took place on June 30, 2018, when the mysterious Visitor launched a rocket that went haywire right in the middle of the battle royale matches that were going on at 10:30 AM PT that morning. The rocket took off, flew way out into space, then turned around and flew in toward toward Tilted Towers. But instead of landing, the rocket hit a rift--and that's when things got <em>really</em> interesting. You can watch the original version of the event in its entirety below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFB7k586Jm4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZFB7k586Jm4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not expected that the Fortnite OG version will be very different than it was when it first happened, but it also wouldn't be surprising if Epic threw in some new wrinkles, like a safe zone where players can watch the event without being threatened by other players.</p><p>The arrival of the Visitor on the Battle Royale island back in Chapter 1 Season 4 marked the beginning of Fortnite's story, though the plotline with the Seven--the Avengers-style group the Visitor belonged to--was largely discarded during Chapter 4. There's been some hope among folks who care about the story that the new version of the Blast Off event could contain some new detail that might tie it in with the current Fortnite plot.</p><p>Whatever the situation ends up being, the event will serve as the beginning of the end of Fortnite OG Season 4, which closes on August 7.</p>

<p dir="ltr">No other details about the game are known aside from its reported codename: FMC. While that doesn't seem like much, as noted by mp1st, the codename may give fans an idea of what could be coming next. The codenames for previous Dark Souls games and the more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/" data-ref-id="5000-577631">Armored Core 6</a> both featured the letter "F" as part of their internal codenames, while games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> used the codename GR. From Software's latest game, the standalone multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, used the internal codename CL.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not a lot to go on. However, based on the codenames, the report speculates that the project doesn't seem to be DLC for any existing From Software game, as the developer typically uses the same codenames in the files for DLC as in the base game. Since it's also reportedly multiplatform in nature, the codename also isn't believed to be referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-announces-the-duskbloods-a-new-rpg-exclusive-to-switch-2/1100-6530560/" data-ref-id="1100-6530560">The Duskbloods, From Software's multiplayer-focused Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> slated for next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the codenames for previous games, that leaves the Dark Souls and Armored Core franchises as strong contenders for the project. While it could potentially be a new entry in either series, there's also a strong chance, as noted by mp1st, that it could be a remake or remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-438502">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">From Software is certainly keeping busy, having released Armored Core 6 in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a> last year, and Elden Ring: Nightreign back in May. It announced it was working on The Duskbloods in April as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">News that another From Software game is coming soon may put some fans at ease given the studio's recent pivot into multiplayer-focused games. However, From Software boss and Duskbloods director Hidetaka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said the studio is not abandoning single-player games</a>, and that it will continue to make games that "embrace our more traditional style."</p>

<figure><a title="Elves 2 Pro 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c782202ee25c2/elves-2-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>My first impression of the Gulikit Elves 2 Pro wasn’t particularly positive. Now, when I say ‘first impression’, I’m talking about the moment I laid eyes on the thing in a few press shots online. I suspect that some of you checking out the photos in this review might be thinking the same thing. Yes, the obvious throwback to the Sega Saturn is great, but does a controller of this design really hold any weight in the modern age?</p>
<p>Well, thankfully, the answer to that question is a hearty “<em>Yes.</em>” When the controllers arrived and I unboxed them from their translucent cases (a nice touch to add extra protection when travelling), I immediately fell in love. The coloured ‘Retro’ model in particular, based on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/04/hardware_classics_sega_saturn">‘Model 2’ Japanese Saturn</a>, is absolutely gorgeous and a lovely homage to Sega’s Mega Drive successor.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067muitnw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The black variant is really nice, too, with the only hint of colour being the blue sync button in between the two analogue sticks. This, again, is a nod to the ‘Model 1’ Japanese Saturn, though the jet black casing is perhaps more akin to the Western design. Think of it like a blend of the two, then. The only downside with the black version is that dust is naturally more noticeable on darker surfaces, so it shows up a lot more than the ‘Retro’ version.</p>

<p>Holding the controller reveals just how well-made it is. It’s got a hefty weight to it: 190g to be exact. This is lighter than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">8BitDo Ultimate 2C controller</a> — both of which weigh in at 235g — but the Elves 2 Pro is a lot smaller than both, so the weight/size ratio balances out nicely. It doesn’t feel cheap, let’s put it that way.</p>
<p>As for the shape, yes, it’s a little unorthodox by modern standards and you’re lacking the longer grips necessary to 'hug' it with your palms, but the curved design feels pleasant. It’s easy enough to move from the face buttons and D-pad to the two analogue sticks in the middle thanks to the offset positioning, though the former setup does feel slightly more natural.</p>
<p>Indeed, you can use this controller for almost any game on Switch or Switch 2, though to say that it’s best suited to retro titles or fighting games wouldn’t be inaccurate. The shape, the colours, the D-pad design: it all feels perfectly suited to retro gaming. For fighting games in particular, purists might lament the lack of the six-button setup on the Saturn's controller, but I felt no concern when testing it out with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>. The D-pad in particular feels great, but more on that shortly.</p>
<p>Looking at the analogue sticks, they utilise Hall Effect technology, so you’re theoretically looking at a long lifespan for the Elves. You can also easily remove the caps for replacement if necessary; I say 'easily,' but they do take a bit of effort to remove, and this is a good thing - you don’t want them coming off during regular play. They’re slightly smaller than your average analogue stick - maybe a <em>fraction</em> smaller than those found on the Switch 2 Joy-Con - and the textured grip around the edge is just begging to pick up grime from your thumbs over time, but overall, they’re really nice.</p>

<p>The same goes for the 'floating' D-pad, too. In fact, I’d say the sensitivity for this is pretty spot on: holding down and rocking the D-pad from side to side yielded absolutely zero accidental inputs when testing it in the Switch settings, and the same can be said in retro titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/streets_of_rage_2">Streets of Rage 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/contra">Contra</a>. It works exactly as intended and as you’d expect. If you want to go one step further, you can actually change the D-pad setup between four-directional and eight-directional, depending on the game you’re playing.</p>
<p>The face buttons and shoulder buttons all feel nice: pleasingly ‘clicky’ without producing a whole lot of noise. Again, a huge shoutout goes to the ‘Retro’ model here: the grey, green, blue, and yellow ABXY buttons look lovely, and I’ve grown really quite fond of the cranberry-coloured shoulder buttons and sync button. Much like the D-pad, you can fiddle with the settings to reassign inputs - pretty good if you’re not fussed about doing it on the Switch itself.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a <em>lot</em> of different settings you can play around with. You can adjust vibration intensity, analogue stick sensitivity, dead zone modes, motion aim assists, turbo mode, APG recording (which basically lets you record specific input combos and repeat them at will), and more.</p>
<p>This is all done via the ‘settings’ button located in the centre of the device (apart from APG recording, which has its own button just below). Holding the button down and pressing a corresponding button changes a specific setting. So, for example, ‘settings’ + ‘R3’ or ‘L3’ changes the sensitivity of the chosen analogue stick. There’s a lot to learn, so it’s worth reading and memorising each setting combination listed in the manual, but it’s nice that there’s no separate app to worry about.</p>

<p>You’ve also got gyro support, three different rumble modes (including its own ‘HD Rumble’, which feels great), wired support with the included USB-C cable, and a capture button. But what’s missing?</p>
<p>Well, there’s no ‘C’ button for GameChat, no headphone jack, no NFC support, and no ability to wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode. These are all arguably ‘nice to have’ functions, and to be honest you’re never going to get a third-party pad that does absolutely <em>everything</em>. If you’re particularly concerned about the lack of ‘wake-up’ support, however, Gulikit has confirmed that it will soon be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gulikit-claims-to-be-the-first-third-party-supporting-wake-up-functionality-on-switch-2">the first third-party manufacturer to offer such support</a>, though how and when this occurs has yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Finally, although the controller does turn off on its own after 15 minutes of inactivity, there’s a teeny, tiny button on the back to turn it off manually. This is a nice little touch that a lot of manufacturers don’t really consider. Of course, whether it will actually be of use to you is very much dependent on your own circumstances, but hey, it’s a good thing to have. The pad can also be used with PC and iOS, with a three-way toggle located just above the off button to switch between the three modes.</p>
<figure><a title="Elves 2 Pro 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62171d0b65aed/elves-2-pro-8.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All in all, though, I'd say the Elves 2 Pro is probably best suited for retro games and fighting games rather than your go-to controller for everyday use. It's an exceptionally well-made pad, and a fabulous alternative to Nintendo's own SNES and Mega Drive NSO controllers. If you've got an affection for the Sega Saturn, the 'Retro' variant in particular is a wonderful throwback; just don't be surprised if you start glancing down to admire it when you really should be keeping your eyes on the screen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Peter Connelly, who Tomb Raider fans will recognize as the original composer and sound designer for the series, is now serving 16 months in jail, beginning yesterday, July 17, 2025, for "<em>fraudulently obtaining</em>" a $50,000 (£37,500) loan from the UK government during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Published on the UK government's official website through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">Insolvency Service</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-composer-jailed-for-16-months-after-being-found-guilty-of-fraud">Eurogamer</a>, Connelly was found to have received two loans for his business when businesses were only allowed to receive one. The first was a legitimate loan at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 for £22,000, or $29,500 USD. The second was a month later, for £37,500, or $50,000 USD. Connelly "<em>deliberately inflated</em>" the turnover his company faced in order to secure a larger loan, said David Snasdell, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service.</p>



<p>Connelly claimed that the turnover his company endured amounted to £150,000, though in reality it was a little over £58,000. When being interviewed regarding the loan, he told the Insolvency Service that he "<em>had been given the opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack</em>," a project he told them would be very lucrative and significant. He claimed to have taken measures like selling his car to pay for the work, though he later claimed the project had stalled. In August 2021, his company went into liquidation, with neither of the loans he'd taken out having been paid back.</p>



<p>Connelly will be paying back the loans over the course of several payments that will continue while he serves his jail time, and he's also been banned from being the director of a company for the next six years. </p>



<p>"<em>Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic</em>," Snasdell said. "<em>Connelly not only secured two loans when businesses were only allowed one, but deliberately inflated his company's turnover to receive more money than he was entitled to</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Connelly isn't the first notable member of the video game industry to be found guilty of financial crimes. Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic, whose last major release was Balan Wonderworld, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-naka-arrested-again-over-insider-trading-relating-to-final-fantasy-vii-the-first-soldier/">was arrested and given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading</a>.</p>

			<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from&nbsp;No Sleep For Kaname Date.&nbsp;As a big fan of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/16/ai-the-somnium-files-review/">AI: The Somnium Files</a>&nbsp;games, it’s hard to picture where in the timeline a third entry could fall that would cleanly follow up on the ending of the second game, while also giving us the characters that this one seemed to be specifically focusing on. Much like how the series tasks you with disregarding your main options and seeking out a hidden third path, that’s the exact route that the developers have ended up taking with this No Sleep For Kaname Date.</p>
<p>This game is neither a prequel nor a sequel – in carving out a hidden third path for themselves, the team behind this title have made a game that creates it’s own context somewhere vaguely in-between both entries. While it doesn’t deliver a satisfying continuation of the main narrative as a result, it still ends up being a really enjoyable, fan-pleasing side-story that I couldn’t help but smile at.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES, System Trailer | Switch, Switch 2, Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzXuPDXSi-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No Sleep For Kaname Date sees the return of the iconic investigative duo from the first game – perverted slacker ABIS agent Kaname Date and his cybernetic AI, the eyeball-shaped companion Aiba. Protagonist duties don’t squarely belong to them, though – you’ll also spend a lot of the game playing directly as Iris, the iconic bubbly social media influencer that the first game revolved around. I’ve already talked a bit about how this game is heavy on fan-pleasing moments for people who enjoy the rest of the series, but it’s also surprisingly packed with send-ups to creator Kotaro Uchikoshi’s other iconic sci-fi murder mystery series, Zero Escape.</p>
<p>Iris suddenly finds herself kidnapped by a UFO and trapped in a mysterious set of escape room puzzles that are part of something called The Third Eye Games. These puzzles literally play out like gameplay from the&nbsp;Zero Escape&nbsp;franchise, all the way down to minute aesthetic details like the “SEEK A WAY OUT” message popping up at the start of a puzzle or the iconic item pickup sound effect returning from&nbsp;999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors.</p>


<p>Much like those games, puzzles in this title are also incredibly absurd, and are nearly impossible to gauge at a base level. The items you need to find, the combinations you need to concoct, and the reactions you need to unfurl to escape each room feel like they’re being made up on the fly – it’s equal parts maddening and entertaining, but rarely feels unfair. In the moments where it does, the game provides some precise difficulty options and hint systems that you can toggle between pretty freely as you play. For a purist, you can stick to hard mode and never use the Seek system that points out your next item to interact with. For a story-focused player or someone struggling with a particular puzzle, the malleability of the difficulty and hints is really helpful for ensuring that the frustration of these escape rooms never boils over.</p>
<p>Between solving escape rooms as Iris, you’re also doing familiar investigations and Psync dives as Kaname Date. These play out exactly as they would in prior games, with nothing new mechanically going on to spice them up. If the entirety of No Sleep For Kaname Date were just these investigation scenes, they would be a bit of a drag considering how familiar and almost formulaic they’ve become. But drizzled in between the escape rooms, they help ground the experience a bit and keep it feeling like a proper AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;entry, while also helping break up the gameplay a bit.</p>

<p>All these moments ultimately serve to support and amplify the writing of the game – that’s something that No Sleep For Kaname Date delivers on in spades. Characters are consistently funny, weird, and absurdist in that way that I love so much. Part of me is still frustrated that the game sort of captures so many of these characters in a bubble of sorts, presenting flanderised versions of them that don’t reflect the growth or changes they go through in the main series. It’s especially frustrating to see Kaname Date and Mizuki presented in the way they are, because the versions of these characters that come later in the story are so much more interesting to explore.</p>
<p>At the same time, this game delivers some really exciting new character interactions that I was sorely missing from the last game. Tama the flirty and air-headed AI companion always felt like such an exciting character to see Kaname Date interact with, and finally having moments in this game where the two of them bounce their idiocy off each other is so much fun.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if you come to No Sleep For Kaname Date looking for a continuation of the story from the first two games, or a title that carves a brave and destructive path for itself the way that games from Kotaro Uchikoshi tend to do, this ain’t it. What it is, though, is like a really creative and entertaining filler arc from a long-running anime. The events of this game might not entirely matter in the grand scheme of things or push the more serious elements of the narrative in any particularly exciting direction, but it is full of fun character moments, wild puzzles, and so much of the charm and absurdity that made the first two games such a blast.</p>

            <p>Alongside working on The Duskbloods and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s post-launch bits, FromSoftware are reportedly deep in development on an unannounced game that could release next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">MP1st</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which claims said game is codenamed FMC, multiplatform and - based on "the nature of the source these details come from" - at an advanced stage of development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The site alleges that unless this game is delayed, it could be in line for a 2026 release. That's the extent of the report's concrete info, with it then dissecting the various codenames given to other FromSoft game while they were in the works.</p>
<p>Since a number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> projects and Armored Core 6 all had codenames beginning with F, as this mystery game reportedly does, MP1st speculate that FMC could be related to one of those series. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, meanwhile, had the snappy moniker SPRJ, so it'd appear you may well be barking up the wrong gothic tree if a PC port of that was your go-to guess.</p>
<p>FMC. Hmmmmmm. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s codename was GR, short for Great Rune. Maybe this is Fuck, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a>'s Cool? Four Massive Cats? Frustratingly Melancholy Chambers? Fear Magical Chairs? Failure, My Chums? Fight Man Crush, with all six thousand things that could mean?</p>
<p>Full Macarena Confidence? Alright, stop there. I'm going with that one. FromSoft collabing with the lyrical talents of Los del Río, who really are the music industry's George R.R Martin, to give you the ego boost you need to accomplish cosa buena.</p>
<p>What do you mean Miyazaki and co would never do that? Whatever, I can't hear you over the sound of vaguely Spanish dancing. As VGC point out, the director made clear <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-promises-switch-2-exclusive-duskbloods-wont-distract-fromsoftware-from-single-player-games/">earlier this year</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods don't signal the studio moving away from the sorts of single player games they made their name with.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-are-reportedly-working-on-an-unannounced-game-alongside-the-duskbloods-that-could-release-next-year]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Zack Snyder has confirmed he's taking a break from Rebel Moon to work on other projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars-style sci-fi movie Rebel Moon launched on Netflix in December 2023 amid much hype. It's set in a galaxy ruled by the imperialistic Motherworld, whose military, the Imperium, threatens a village on the moon Veldt. As the titles suggest, a band of rebels fights back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Netflix had high hopes for Rebel Moon, critics panned the film. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder">Rebel Moon review</a> returned a 4/10. We said: "Zack Snyder's space opera is let down by a derivative patchwork script, mediocre action sequences and a superficial story."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sequel Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver followed in April 2024, and it met with a similar reception. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-netflix-zack-snyder">Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver review</a> was another 4/10. "The second part of Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon space opera, The Scargiver, delivers a half-baked conclusion to a well-trodden story with flimsy character studies and lacklustre action." R-rated director's cuts of both Rebel Moon 1 and 2 followed in 2024 and met with a more positive reception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got sidetracked into this — not sidetracked, it’s all uptown problems, as they say — for Netflix, I’m working on an LAPD SWAT movie,” Snyder told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/rebel-moon-video-game-zack-snyder-film-franchise-superman-1236453663/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> in a recent interview. “So I was like, OK, well, I’m gonna just sort of let that Rebel Moon world boil for a minute, and I’m gonna go do this.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Man of Steel writer and director, who is perhaps best known for his work on the now rebooted DC Universe, also highlighted the complicated nature of working on two projects simultaneously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it,” he explained. “I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break. So yeah, we’ll see after I finish this, when I come back, where we are with everything.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as more stories or even more film adaptations specifically being planned in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/rebel-moon-part-2-the-scargiver">Rebel Moon</a> universe, Snyder was mostly tightlipped about any confirmations. ​​“There’s tons of stories. So, I mean, I think it’s literally, it’s endless,” he said. “But, again, like I say, I’m waiting to see how we want to and in what way we would move forward, if at all.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s clear Snyder <em>does</em> feel like the possibilities for Rebel Moon are endless — because we now have a video game spinoff set in the universe to go along with the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-video-game-launches-for-netflix-subscribers-as-zack-snyder-keeps-plans-for-future-movies-paused">called Blood Line</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

Essentially a user-friendly version of Blender, players are able to sculpt in 3D, producing incredible works of art--or pure nightmare fuel--that have been chiseled to perfection.</p><p>This is meant to be a creative diversion from DK's new adventure, and some of the creations that people have gleefully uploaded to their social media accounts are best described as creative or cursed--sometimes, both--and they're all <em>excellent</em>.</p><p>Some of the creations glimpsed below include Five Nights at Freddy's fanart, an unflattering portrait of US VP JD Vance, and a version of DK that can see into the very depths of your soul. All of them look like they could easily replace the Mona Lisa at The Louvre, and at the very least, they deserve their own wing at that art museum.</p><p>People are really making the most of this mode, as the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls offer a high level of precision. Accessing Artist Mode is also easy, as it's available from the main menu of Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza has earned critical acclaim since it launched this week, as it's not only one of the best games of the year, but a must-play Switch 2 title as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.8 will be launching in late July, bringing with it a brand new permanent summer resort map, a new playable character, and more.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month's Version 5.7 update</a>, Version 5.8 will arrive on July 30th. Its main new addition is the Easybreeze Holiday Resort, where you'll meet familiar faces pursuing their own agendas, including none other than everyone's favorite bard Venti.</p>

<p>The new map will also grant you traversal powers that will allow you to "glide across water and hover briefly in midair across the layers of the resort", and you'll gain other powers that will let you solve new puzzles and explore the resort more effectively as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.8-easybreeze-holiday-resort.jpg?itok=5ncAcvWU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.8-easybreeze-holiday-resort.jpg?itok=iuXQ2PwU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A brand new holiday resort is being added in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.8.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>version update without a new character to play as, and while there's only one to add to your roster this time around, you'll want to take the time.</p>

<p>Ineffa is a 5-star polearm user based on the Electro element, and she can deal continuous Electro damage by summoning a devastating thunder cloud to hover over the battlefield. Not only that, but if she's your active character, she can summon a shield and a drone that deals extra Electro damage for her.</p>

<p>You'll be able to recruit Ineffa to your team as part of the first half of Version 5.8's wish cycle, along with a rerun of Citlali. In the second half, you'll get the chance to recruit Mualani and Chasca if you missed them the first time around.</p>




<p>As ever, there are also bonus codes to give you some free stuff as part of this version cycle, so here they are!</p>

<ul><li>Ineffa0730Birgitta - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>Summer0730Asha - 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>TranquilBanquet - 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>. Version 5.8 launches on July 30th.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I've only dipped my distal index fingerbone in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-necromancers-tale">The Necromancer's Tale</a>, a just-released historical fantasy tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Psychic Software, but I can at least report back that the character creator is a gentle joy, to the point that I was disappointed to reach the end of it. True to the promise/threat of "400,000 words of hand-written narrative and lore", it's a hearty choose-your-own-adventure prologue that follows the protagonist's infancy and early adulthood. Each choice you make skews the stats on the left. Might sound unremarkable of concept. Here's why it's stuck with me.</p><!--more-->

<p>Firstly, the guy doing the narration has a fine set of pipes indeed, with intonation that reminds me of certain elder Drag n' Dunkers (the loudly painted 3D graphics, a little less so). I can imagine that actor leaning across the campfire to tell tales of the Time of Troubles, a chaotic period, when gods were made flesh and forced to walk the earth. In general, I wish more RPGs conducted themselves like weird storytellers in the woods. Make us feel like kids again, watching the flames on a frosty, moonless Halloween.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's a nice showcase for the game's writing, and how it informs the stat-massaging. The Necromancer's Tale is set near Venice in a mildly sorcerous version of 18th century Europe, where "courtly intrigue collides with black magic even as chemistry emerges from alchemy". You are a child of nobles who meets with strange fortune and takes a hard left into lichedom. </p>
<p>That's the kind of rich setup that often leads to sentences that sag beneath the weight of adjectives and metaphors like sickly, fermenting, wasp-blighted plum trees, but the prologue writing is spare and evenly stressed, easy to read aloud. More importantly, the relationship between the choose-your-own adventure decisions and the evolution of your stats is unclear in an engaging way.</p>
<p>Some of the decisions are QTE fare, like "do I fend off this stone-throwing girl with a stick or do I ask her to stop". Sometimes they are more introspective. An example: I have just been banished by my parents, for reasons unknown. As I'm borne away in a carriage, I have the choice of feeling angry and unwanted, or wounded and betrayed, or simply confused. Now, see if you can work out how those emotions will feed into my nine core stats: Strength, Agility, Constitution, Acuity, Knowledge, Investigate, Analyse, Impress, or Convince. </p>
<p>It's not an <em>absolute</em> enigma, but there's enough slipperiness that I make the choice more to discover the outcome, than to boost the preferred stat. I like it when RPG yarns successfully unhitch my brain from The Numbers. Elsewhere, the prologue attempts the perilous feat of taking some Numbers away. As you age, things happen that lower your stats. I found these misadventures just as convincing - all part of life's pissy golden tapestry - and I liked how they got around the presumable underlying design issue of needing to cap the player's points.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>If all of this leaves you cold, rest assured that there's the option of skipping the adventure book element and just adding or deducting those points from a bar. Go on, play it like you're doing your taxes - I'd judge you for it if I hadn't once been fined £800 for handing my tax return in late. You can also tinker with the points after completing the prologue. Myself, I'm sticking with the character I've rolled, an absolute weed with respectable detective skills, a little book learning and a plausible manner.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the game - well, it's early days, but I'm not sure the combat is anything to write home about. It's turn- and hex-based with melee, projectiles and spells. Pretty routine. My enthusiasm will hinge on whether the necromancy component lets you do things more devious than summoning increasingly gnarly hordes.</p>
<p>I'm more compelled by the game's social intrigue aspect, which reminds me of Vampyr. The greater the quantity of skelliwags and other phantoms you hang out with, the more you risk getting into trouble with local townsfolk. There's the risk of torchlit arrest, court proceedings and even a brusque lynching for necromancers who don't keep their cadavers in check. The prologue gave me a little taste of this: an eventful meeting with Isaac Newton, who shrieked that I was an agent of the grim reaper before dropping peacefully dead of old age. You have to love the chutzpah of a game that relegates one of the Enlightenment's big beasts to the role of Scream Queen.</p>
<p>I can't promise that we'll review The Necromancer's Tale, because belts remain tight and I have yet to devise the enchantment that lets me conjure an army of skeletal staff writers. No, chatbots don't count: that's not "dark magic", just tech industry chicanery, and you can tell Bezos I said so, assuming he is not you. Still, perhaps I'll keep plugging away with this. There's the prospect of escorting a corpse to a ball, amongst other things.

He’s fast, has a bunch of different attacks, and uses lots of hard to block magic. In addition to dodging incoming threats, you also have to manage a madness meter or risk getting one-shotted.

Unlike the first rotation, which only included three, there will be four this time around, though the final boss, Night Aspect, is clearly being saved for later. </p><p>The first Everdark Sovereign was Gaping Jaw, who basically spent the entire fight in a frenzied state, continuously attacking over and over with few openings and a giant thundercloud that starts popping halfway through the encounter. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-gaping-jaw-everdark-sovereign-1851784820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-gaping-jaw-everdark-sovereign-1851784820">He kicked players’ asses</a></span>, and the subsequent Everdark Sovereigns haven’t been nearly as hard. I’m looking forward to finally seeing the FromSoftware ramp the difficulty up again, even if it seems like Equilibrious Beast, also known as Libra Creature of Night, won’t be arriving until around mid-August. </p><p>I’m also beginning to sense a bit of fatigue among existing <em>Nightreign</em> diehards. My friends and I have been taking a break recently after getting the Platinum Trophy on PS5 and killing all the existing Everdark variants. While it’ll be nice to have a reason to come back, I think we’re reaching the point where <em>Nightreign</em> needs more substantial additions to keep players invested. Those might include completely new maps, changing up the current loot and enemy pools, or new classes. Hell, it would even be neat, if terrifying, to see a new mode start throwing multiple bosses at players in the same fight, something that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-finds-a-new-way-to-victimise-players-as-nightfarers-accidentally-fight-2-bosses-at-once-they-were-convinced-i-was-just-being-dumb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-finds-a-new-way-to-victimise-players-as-nightfarers-accidentally-fight-2-bosses-at-once-they-were-convinced-i-was-just-being-dumb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a few have already encountered via online network errors</a></span>. </p><p>None of that needs to come right away. We’re still just a couple months out from launch. But the fundamentals of <em>Nightreig</em>n are so strong that I hope FromSoftware continues to cook with it. Fans are still waiting on a promised duos mode and the recent patches have been mostly just minor bug fixes. Hopefully, that energy is going toward a bigger update by the end of the summer or beyond. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568]]></content:encoded>
