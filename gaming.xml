For example, if you were a member, you could play the <em>Halo Master Chief Collection </em>on your phone via cloud streaming. But, if a game you wanted to stream and play wasn’t included in the Game Pass catalog, you were screwed. That changes today, though only for some games. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20, Xbox announced</a></span> that it would finally let people stream some games they already own.

		<p>Microsoft has announced that you can now stream your own games with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, a feature bundled in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. Well, you can stream some of them, with the company limiting this to just 50 games to start with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stream Your Own Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79Rza5taYAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s a pretty limited opening salvo, though makes sense for Microsoft to gradually ramp the selection up – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/04/xbox-game-pass-xcloud-streaming-15-september-dualshock-4/">echoes of the original cloud gaming launch</a> – instead of trying to cover thousands of Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S games from the off. Of course, since you need to have a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, this is in addition to all of the streamable games included within that (whether you own them outright or not).</p>
<p>Own game streaming is included in <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/regions">all 28 countries</a> where Xbox Cloud Gaming is available, and is supported via TVs and browsers on smartphone, tablets and PC – note that the Xbox Game Pass app recently lost the ability to stream on Android, and never had it on iOS. Microsoft is working to build it into the Xbox app for Windows and on Xbox consoles in 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/">Head to the Xbox site for compatible device guidelines and how to get started</a>.</p>

<p>Notable games that are included in this launch list are Baldur’s Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. They’re all games that are unlikely to feature in Game Pass for the foreseeable future, and so are great ones to include here.</p>
<p>The 50 games available today are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Animal Well</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</li>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Baldur’s Gate 3</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</li>
<li>The Casting of Frank Stone</li>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
<li>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</li>
<li>Dredge</li>
<li>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</li>
<li>Farming Simulator 25</li>
<li>Fear the Spotlight</li>

<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The Outlast Trials</li>
<li>The Plucky Squire</li>
<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>
<li>Tom Clancy’s The Division 2</li>
<li>TopSpin 2K25</li>
<li>Undertale</li>
<li>Visions of Mana</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li>
<li>WWE 2K24</li>
</ol>
<p>When it was still known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-xcloud">Project xCloud</a> in 2019, Microsoft confirmed their intention to let users start streaming their purchased games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-50-games-dualshock-4-pc-coming-to-japan-canada-india-europe-2020/">in 2020</a>. While Xbox Cloud Gaming itself launched in 2020, purchased streaming was pushed back to 2022… but never materialised. Cloud Gaming has always been restricted to games in the Xbox Game Pass library, and even then isn’t necessarily universal. It’s great to finally have this feature added, even if it is rather limited.</p>

			<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> that Xbox Cloud Gaming would be updated to support the long-awaited feature to allow users to stream their own games. Today, that feature has gone live with that name: Stream Your Own Game. Of course, you'll need an active Game Pass Ultimate subscription. The feature is currently available on Samsung Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, Meta Quest headsets, and (via browser) on PCs, smartphones, and tablets. You can read more about compatibility on the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/set-up-smart-tv-xbox-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support page</a>. Stream Your Own Game will launch next year for Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on PC, too.</p>
<p>To start with, the following fifty games are available for streaming:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301435/final-fantasy-14-mobile-square-enix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you heard that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22877031/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-square-enix-pc">critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a> is getting a mobile version? In a video announcement, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> game director Naoki Yoshida announced <em>FFXIV Mobile</em>, a joint production between Square Enix and Tencent’s Lightspeed Studios<em>. </em>The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer showing Warriors of Light in locations all across the game’s world of Eorzea. </p><p>It seems as though <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> will be a reset of sorts for the MMORPG, featuring content from the base game without anything from its five expansions. In the video, Yoshida said that Lightspeed Studios was working to, “faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content, and other aspects of the original game.” Lightspeed Studios, known for<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17128526/pubg-mobile-hands-on-review-vs-xbox-fortnite"><em>PUBG Mobile</em></a>, is a subsidiary of Tencent which has had success adapting a number of mobile games from other companies’ IP including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294524/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-game"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon</em></a>, and<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.</p><p>The teaser trailer didn’t exactly show what <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> combat would look like. But judging from the little bit of battle it did show, it seems like Square Enix might be aiming to make a <em>FFXIV</em> version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/18/16979602/final-fantasy-xv-pocket-edition-ios-android"><em>Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition</em></a> — a stripped down mobile version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/28/13757150/final-fantasy-15-review-ps4-xbox-one">2016 RPG</a> with simplified combat controls and chibi-fied character art. <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931"><em>FFXIV Mobile</em>’s website boasts</a> that players will have access to nine job classes (the full-version of the game has 21) that they’ll be able to switch classes with a single tap rather than requiring players to dig into their inventory and equip a job stone.</p><p>Neither Yoshida’s video nor the website went into detail about how much the game will cost and what, if any, traditional mobile game elements will make it in. However, according to a report in Japanese gaming magazine <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23633"><em>Famitsu</em></a>, <em>FFXIV Mobile</em> will be free-to-play but will not contain any gacha elements. This potentially means the game will have to incorporate monetization some other way and if Square Enix knows anything at all about its player base, then expect to pay for mounts and, critically, player costumes. After all, glamour is the true endgame.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to staffers at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thegameawards.com/voting-jury&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thegameawards.com/voting-jury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jury outlets</a></span> <em>Kotaku </em>has spoken to, ballots were due on November 12. While each outlet has its own internal processes for how it handles submitting nominations, some that <em>Kotaku</em> spoke to explained they had to have votes in at an even earlier date so they could tally those votes for submission. The result is several overlapping deadlines that affect which games actually have a reasonable chance of being nominated for The Game Awards. A game like <em>The Veilguard</em>, which can take up to 60 hours to complete and launched less than two weeks before ballots were due, is affected more by timing than any other factor. Voters didn’t have as much time to play it as they did similarly epic games like <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> which launched much earlier, nor does it benefit from brevity the way some games do, like <em>Astro Bot</em>.</p><p>Because of the lack of distance between the eligibility cut-off and votes being due, timing is everything in determining whether or not some games even get on the ballot. Oftentimes, the Game Awards are less a celebration of the best and brightest the industry has to offer than they are a representation of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/game-awards-2024-nominations-snubs-surprises/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/game-awards-2024-nominations-snubs-surprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular and mainstream games that voters actually got around to</a></span>. Games that aren’t even out yet are technically eligible, but it’s unlikely that many voters will have had much time with these, if any. Sure, someone might have a review copy, but one or two people at a publication trying to convince their colleagues who haven’t touched a game that they should give it a space on their single ballot to the biggest award show in the industry is a near-impossible task. The lack of a meaningful gap between the eligibility cut-off and when ballots are due is especially damaging to games that technically fall within the window but are only available to a select few jurors, and only for a brief time before their votes must be cast.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-recommend-id="image://e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Game Awards</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-recommend-id="image://e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For example, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 </em>launched today, November 20, and while I don’t think it would have been nominated for much, under The Game Awards’ current structure, it was technically eligible. But a game that only a select few of the jury has been able to put reasonable time into will never have a fair shot because statistically, almost no one on the jury would have been able to play it. As long as the show’s eligibility window ends within a hair’s breadth of when the ballots are due, games that launch close to the show itself are sprinting after competition that’s had a months-long head start. Sometimes a game like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a></span><em> </em>manages to make its way into multiple categories despite releasing late in the window because it’s a huge, first-party IP that you can complete in a comfortable 20 hours. Other games end up like <em>The Veilguard</em>,<em> </em>launching at a time so disadvantageous that you only get one nomination in Accessibility, chosen by a specialist panel whose role in the awards is to be tuned into that pillar of game design.<br></p><p>Compare this to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2025-grammys-online-entry-process-how-to-guide-now-open&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2025-grammys-online-entry-process-how-to-guide-now-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grammys</a></span>, one of the biggest awards ceremonies in the music industry. This next one is set to take place on February 2, but the eligibility criteria is months removed from the actual show. The 2025 Grammys will recognize music released from September 16, 2023 to August 30, 2024. Nominations weren’t even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced until November 8</a></span>. Look at all that time and space to actually consider what should be nominated. I’m not going to go to bat for The Grammys’ actual nominations because that show has its own institutional problems and a very narrow view of what’s worth recognizing. However, the structure of its eligibility and nomination process sure does sound like it would solve some of The Game Awards’ problems.</p><p>A lot of other video game award shows, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/20/2025-bafta-games-awards-opens-for-entries-with-new-fairer-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/20/2025-bafta-games-awards-opens-for-entries-with-new-fairer-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like the BAFTA Games Awards</a></span>, also don’t do this, and instead put months of distance between the window of eligibility and the date of the actual show. So why does The Game Awards do things this way? We reached out to the show for comment and didn’t receive an answer in time for publication, but I would hypothesize that much of it boils down to the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">feeling like an ad for games</a></span> rather than a celebration of them. December is a strategic time for publishers to want their games to be adorned with accolades as people are looking to make their Christmas lists. I have to wonder if The Game Awards is even capable of this kind of restructuring, given how embedded it is in the industry’s marketing cycle. But if the show even considered how its structure inevitably undermines games like <em>The Veilguard</em>, it might make for a better, more representative event.</p><p>Inevitably, there will be those who say <em>The Veilguard </em>wasn’t snubbed and that it just didn’t deserve recognition. Pushing aside the bad-faith transphobic and racist nonsense that’s been surrounding the games for months, there’s a discussion to be had there. It is, without a doubt, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">one of the more divisive games</a></span> in BioWare’s catalog. But anyone who thinks its timing didn’t play a factor in its complete absence is kidding themselves, and this kind of fundamental failing will affect games you like just as much as ones you don’t one day. Justice for Gareth David-Lloyd, you deserved a Best Performance nod for your work as Solas.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft is also planning to bring Xbox library streaming to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows next year.</p><p>This expansion is part of a long-running project known as Project Lapland inside of Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">I revealed last month</a> that Microsoft was planning to start letting Xbox Insiders get access to more games on Xbox Cloud Gaming in November, and these initial 50 games are the start of eventually expanding this to thousands of Xbox games to cover entire libraries.</p><p>The original Project xCloud was&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/11/14/expanding-project-xcloud-more-games-more-ways-to-play/">supposed to launch</a>&nbsp;with game library streaming in 2020, but it never did, and Microsoft then announced it would support game libraries on Xbox Cloud Gaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159492/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-library-owned-games-feature">in 2022</a>. That never happened either, and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268038/xbox-cloud-gaming-project-lapland-game-library">reported last month</a> that the work to make this a reality has been complicated. Microsoft has to ready thousands of games on its custom Xbox cloud servers while balancing save files, game updates, and much more. </p><p>While thousands of games will eventually be available through Xbox Cloud Gaming, I’m told some publishers will hold certain games back due to licensing requirements or deals.</p><p>Microsoft was also planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app</a> for Android in the US in November, thanks to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">court ruling</a>&nbsp;last month that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store. Google won a temporary administrative stay on this ruling late last month, so it’s no longer clear when Microsoft will be able to enable game purchases in its Xbox mobile app on Android.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a> is one of the games I think of when I recall the golden days of video game expos, before Covid rolled up and nuked the business model. It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.</p>
<p>Most rounds of Gang Beasts go like this: an absolutely brainless opening scrum before the participants peel off into separate duels. At least one person will throw themselves off a ledge whilst trying to throw somebody else. People will struggle to see what they're doing because they're sobbing with laughter. And then, the finale: two or more players dangling from a precipice, grimly refusing to let go of each other, until somebody manages to headbutt the player holding onto the building.</p>
<p>I love Gang Beasts. I loved it at expos and I love playing it at home with my family. So I'm tickled punk to learn that the Steam version has received a chonky new update, adding a driveable construction crane level and flocks of vicious, cuddly birds. Here's a trailer.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwDIDelKZ6Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/285900/view/4482865501645570061?l=english">As detailed in the announcement blog</a>, Update 1.25 adds a new Crane level that "includes the first implementation of our new driveables system, with players being able to jump into the Crane cockpit to take the controls." Weaponising construction equipment? How very Gang Beasts. But watch out, because Crane also harbours some new and angry wildlife. Survive for long enough, and avian hoodlums will swoop down, seize you in their talons and try to fly off with you. The obvious question: if all the players link arms, can the birds pick up everybody at once?</p><p>The update also adds a few bird-themed costumes - unfortunately, it doesn't look like they give you the power of flight. This is the first proper Gang Beasts update in years, I think, though there have been smaller patches for bugs and whatnot. Are you still playing? In the course of writing this up, I've learned that there might genuinely be some kind of serious Gang Beasts competitive scene. Leave it to gamers to ruin the fun.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has released a statement on the state of its game, as its sequel finally becomes available to play.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 made its debut today across Xbox and PC, but is already the subject of multiple technical issues - these issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, GSC has addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges" now that it is out in the wild. However, the studio has assured its players will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p>

<p>"We are absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention," the developer wrote. "In the first few days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can."</p>
<p>Following this, GSC will release more substantial updates for Stalker 2, as well as free in-game content. More details on the game's roadmap will be shared in December, GSC said, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>"We have big plans for the Stalker universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey," the team closed. "We're blessed to have you before, we're blessed to have you now. The Zone belongs to you. Have fun."</p>

<p>Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocated staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's game time. We need to run through several training scenarios with you before you can take the field again after your injury. So grab your gear and head into the War Games Combat Arena for the first cycle of training, and get ready because you're training against other Spartans who are also eager to prove themselves.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a brand new miniatures game from Mantic Games, of which we've covered several of their products over the years, from the sci-fi skirmish game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deadzone-3e-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Deadzone</a>, the sports battler <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow">OverDrive</a>, and their awesome fantasy mass battle game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kings-of-war-guide" rel="nofollow">Kings of War</a>. In this article, we'll have a look at the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Recon Edition set, talk about what it contains and how it plays.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-3.jpg?itok=f4pGHW9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-3.jpg?itok=HlU0b-hu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Recon Edition box is a great place for anyone to start their <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> journey (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure>

<p>For those who don't know <em>Halo</em> was a popular first-person shooter series of games that started in 2001, with its latest release, <em>Halo Infinite</em> in 2021. <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a licensed release between 343 Industries and Mantic Games, and brings the first-person deathmatch game to the tabletop, using Mantic's <em>Deadzone</em> rules system, with some tweaks to add <em>Halo</em> theme to it.</p>

<p>The Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition contains:</p>

<ul><li>8x Spartan models</li>
	<li>Rulebook</li>
	<li>Playmat</li>
	<li>Pre-coloured card terrain and tokens</li>
	<li>10x Weapon cards</li>
	<li>8x Player/model cards</li>
	<li>2x Reference cards</li>
	<li>12x D8 dice</li>
	<li>6x Command dice</li>
</ul><p>The miniatures are single piece and ready to play (also colored Red and Blue, which is a nod to the Red vs Blue <em>Halo </em>TV show). This, combined with the beginner's mission on one side of the game mat, which features a smaller map and the rules printed around the edge, makes getting <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> from opening to play extremely fast and beginner-friendly. The scenery is also printed card, that slots together easily and quickly, so you can get the whole Recon box set up extremely fast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-1.jpg?itok=WDnYXdjc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-1.jpg?itok=_F2dbpjM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;War Games expansion will make all your <em>Halo</em> Wargames dreams come true (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>Is Halo Flashpoint A Full Wargame?</h2>

<p>The Recon Edition of the game is just the start of Mantic's <em>Halo</em> plans and works as a starter set for the system, and also as a standalone product. There is a larger version of the game available, the Spartan Edition, which includes more miniatures and scenery, and early next year, Mantic will release the War Games Expansion, which will turn <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> into a full tabletop wargame, with points values and list building, taking it away from the limited draft you have out of the Recon Edition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-5.jpg?itok=1xTOPiIn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-5.jpg?itok=wSfLAxXw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan miniatures come pre-colored red and blue, but look even better painted&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Halo Flashpoint?</h2>

<p>For those coming from Mantic's <em>Deadzone</em> rules, much will be familiar here, with a few tweaks for the full <em>Halo</em> thematic experience. For those unfamiliar, games of <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> are played on gridded maps with scenery known as cubes. Models use their movement value to move between cubes, freely placing them within the cube itself. This also covers movement up and down over the scenery. This system keeps everything straightforward for movement, as well as measuring range and working out line of sight for units. This system, like the Deadzone rules they come from, makes this extremely beginner-friendly, but also offers veteran wargames a simple system, so they can focus on the other areas of tactical combat.</p>

<p>To shoot and attack, players roll 3 eight-sided dice (D8) and compare the roll to the Ranged or Fight characteristics on the Spartan's profile card, which details what they need to roll to succeed. Modifiers to the roll add or subtract dice, depending on if the target is in cover, or you are on higher ground, or for melee combat, if there are additional units in the same cube. The target of the attack also rolls 3 dice and compares it to their Survive characteristic, each success cancels out an attack dice. If attack dice remain, damage is dealt.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo</em> experience comes into <em>Halo Flashpoint </em>not only through the miniatures, artwork, and attention to detail that the designers have put into the arms and equipment from the <em>Halo</em> universe, but the way it's designed actually feels like a Team Deathmatch. One of the key mechanics to this is the respawn, which allows removed models to return to the field the next time they would activate, losing their first activation to move back onto the field and then continue with their actions as normal. This removal and slight delay, while simple mechanics-wise, really captures the feel of the game, and with scenarios like Capture the Flag and Stronghold, makes it a perfect example of getting the video game theme onto the tabletop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-2.jpg?itok=3bdZsGgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-2.jpg?itok=xXWx2P8O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Currrently the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Paint Set is the only place to get the playable Master Chief miniature&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>Can I Play Master Chief In Halo Flashpoint?</h2>

<p>You can absolutely play Master Chief in <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, unfortunately just not out of the Recon Edition box. Master Chief is available in the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set, which includes 8 Army Painter paints, a brush, the Master Chief miniature, and a profile card to use him in game.</p>

<p>The Recon Editon includes 2 identical teams of 4 Spartans. Each team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - The MK VII comes armed with an MA40 Assault Rifle, they can pin targets down or take them out with the accuracy that comes from a high rate of fire. They also have the Tactician ability,&nbsp;which means you roll&nbsp;more command dice to access extra abilities for the fire team.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - The Brawler has a better Fight stat than the others, but a lower Ranged stat, and they come armed with the close-range but lethal CQS48 Bulldog.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - The Zvezda has the scout ability, which lets them advance one cube after set up, letting them close on objectives. They have an average shoot and a poor fight stat, but the VK78 Commando they come armed with has Optics, which improves their shooting ability.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - The Deadeye has the best range&nbsp;stat of the 4 Recon Edition Spartans, and the M392 DMR rifle they come armed with has optics for even better accuracy, and lethal for extra damage on each hit.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-4.jpg?itok=IyPxevNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-4.jpg?itok=KFwi4f5f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 4 different&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan miniatures from the Recon Edition box&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Halo Flashpoint Recon Editon?</h2>

<p><i>Halo Flashpoint </i>is one of the best playable out-of-the-box wargames I've seen, with an incredible open-to-table time. While the box itself is fairly limited in play for veteran wargamers with 2 teams of equal Spartan types, it gives a solid starting point for anyone looking to get into the game, and it's perfect for beginners. If you're looking for more variety before the expansion that opens up the game is released, then consider the Spartan Edition that we hope to review soon on the site. The <em>Deadzone</em> rules still hold up, and play perfectly into not only the <em>Halo</em> theme but also captures the overall Team Deathmatch style of the game. Now we wait for the solo Master Chief narrative campaign that Mantic is definitely going to release right?</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition?</h2>

<p>If you want an incredible beginner-friendly quick-to-table game, just in time for Christmas, then <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you. If you're a <em>Halo</em> fan, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is definitely for you. If you want a great tabletop iteration of Team Deathmatch, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you. If you want a <em>Halo</em> wargame, <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is for you, but not just yet, you'll have to wait for the War Games Expansion next year, but still pick <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> up, because you still get the full rules and some great miniatures to start playing with. If you want a huge amount of replayability and variety out of the box, then the Recon Edition might not be for you, but consider the Spartan Edition, which comes with more Spartans and some Elites and we'll comment on how much variety it has when we get hold of a copy.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://madoka-exedra.com/en/news/?id=66647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a notice on the game's official website</a> (which is in both Japanese and English), Aniplex says that the game has been pushed back to spring 2025. It was originally intended for release sometime this year, but given that we're in mid-November and no release date was forthcoming, a delay probably isn't surprising.</p>

<p>According to Aniplex,&nbsp;<em>Magia Exedra&nbsp;</em>was delayed in order to "deliver the best possible gaming experience" and "ensure even higher quality in the final game", which is a pretty broad statement. This is where we wheel out that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-miyamoto-really-say-a-delayed-game-is-eventually-good-but-a-rushed-game-is-forever-bad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supposed Miyamoto quote</a> about delayed and rushed games, right?</p>

The devs simply say they're "working diligently towards a release that will exceed player expectations", thanking fans for their patience. Looks like we'll have to wait a little while before we know when we can play this one.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</em>, it's an anime series that serves as a sort of deconstruction of the classic anime "magical girl" trope; in fact, the Japanese title is&nbsp;<em>Mahō Shōjo Madoka Magika</em>, with&nbsp;<i lang="ja-Latn" xml:lang="ja-Latn">mahō shōjo&nbsp;</i>being the Japanese term for "magical girl".</p>

<p>The story revolves around a group of girls who sign contracts to become magical girls and battle witches, but the narrative and themes&nbsp;<em>Puella Magi Madoka Magica&nbsp;</em>goes for might surprise you if you're expecting a typical magical girl anime.</p>

                <p>The world of Dragon Age is host to a slew of fantastical characters, voiced by a who's who of big names in the world of voice acting--with some sci-fi and fantasy celebrities sprinkled in. From Freddie Prinze Jr. voicing the mighty Iron Bull to Kate Mulgrew as the mysterious Flemeth, one cast member landed the job with a very unconventional audition tape.</p><p>Claudia Black, who made her mark in sci-fi as Aeryn Sun in Farscape, auditioned for the part of Morrigan in Dragon Age: Origins by sending in a recording of her doing a beat poetry version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back." Dragon Age creator David Gaider said that the character went through several concepts, but couldn't deny Black the opportunity and listened.</p><p>"I lost my goddamn mind," Gaider said on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbdpsilhg22c" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> account. "Yes, I still have the recording. No, you cannot have it."</p><p>Gaider continued with bringing Black on board and adjusting the character to fit her voice. "Naturally, we jumped on that immediately. As I recall, this was met with resistance from higher up--they had this image of Morrigan as young, like 18 years old (no idea where this came from), and complained that Claudia sounded 'too old.' [Voice director] Caroline [Livingstone} and I were determined, so we pushed ahead. We had to agree to get Claudia to sound 'younger,' which I was dubious about. The first two sessions we asked her to pitch her voice up and it was awful."</p><p>When both Livingstone and Gaider were working with Black to get her to focus on "sounding right," they told her to use her natural voice. It worked. "We loved her performance so much we had the feeling that the team would love it too and forget their nonsense," Gaider added. "They did."</p><p>The character of Morrigan was a touchstone for Gaider and opened up the door for Black to continue her video game voice work in big game franchises like Uncharted and Destiny. She reprises the role once again in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p>"[Morrigan] is the heart of [Dragon Age: Origin]. Way beyond her initial inspirations. Some said 'she's just an ice queen' like some I'd written (Viconia, Bastila, etc.) but such categories are very reductive, I find. She had a voice I could instantly slip into, every time, without fail."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-cd-projekt-red-confirms.1040808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that it currently doesn't have any plans to release a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>PS5 Pro patch, so if you were hoping the game was about to get cyber-augmented for Sony's beefy new machine, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, CDPR crushes the dreams of anyone who was hoping for a PS5 Pro-enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in just nine words (or ten if you consider "PS5" two words): "we currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch".</p>

<p>Of course, CD Projekt Red is fully entitled to do whatever it likes with its games, but the lack of a PS5 Pro patch for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>feels a touch disappointing given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-opencritic-page-will-warn-players-about-technical-issues" rel="nofollow">history of technical issues</a> (although those issues admittedly weren't anywhere near as bad in the PS5 version).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=nRZbaz4E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-coming-combat.jpg?itok=sME3GoAc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>isn't getting a PS5 Pro patch anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>CD Projekt Red also hasn't said anything about its seminal action-RPG&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>getting any kind of PS5 Pro patch, so whichever of the studio's two biggest RPGs you're into, you're out of luck if you're a PS5 Pro owner.</p>

<p>It's likely that production on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-team-relocating-to-boston" rel="nofollow">sequel</a> is taking precedence over further major changes to the original game. Last we heard, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-sold-43-million-copies-as-dev-team-for-sequel-is-being" rel="nofollow">development team for said sequel was being assembled</a>, although naturally, we don't know what the game will be called or when it will launch yet.</p>

            <p>One of my proudest pictures of a 2018 trip to Croatia wasn't of me and my pal. No, it wasn't of the beautiful scenery or the glistening sea either. It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn't seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume <em>together</em> in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there's a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neko-odyssey">Neko Odyssey</a> on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It's nice!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Neko Odyssey goes for a familiar nostalgic Japanese game look, employing a 2D pixellated style overlaid on a 3D backdrop. It really captures the heart, what with pleasant boppy music and an authentic-seeming town in the demo. Solid vending machine work. Good ramen restaurant layout. Strong abundance of cats.</p>
<p>Cats that you'll want to take photos of, largely by walking up to them and pressing the space bar. The aim? To grow your Insta following for an audience who demands more cat pics, with those likes viewable at the press of a button and a quick doomscroll of your feed.</p>
<p>One of my favourite pics was of a cat whose face was wedged in a crack in a wall.</p>

<p>And I like this one of a cat who was sat opposite his owner in a ramen restaurant, clearly annoyed at his lack of a portion.</p>

</figure>
<p>Some cats aren't that easy to take photos of, though. Some demand cat food, while others are perched in hard-to-reach places you'll need to figure out a route towards. According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2476350/Neko_Odyssey/">Steam page</a>, there's also a "storyline where you'll unravel the mysteries of the town based on the information you capture in your cat photos". I can't say mine have much truth to them.</p>
<p>No, I won't pretend that Neko Odyssey is going to be the next big thing. But <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2476350/Neko_Odyssey/">the demo</a> is pleasant enough for a quick jaunt and a quick hit of the dopamine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl is out today. As you may have read, it's on the buggy side. Buggier than a bucketful of locusts. Buggier than Kafka's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a>. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl review</a>, wasteland wanderer James called it "easily the most borked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> I've played in years", detailing such issues as HUD elements disappearing, stuttery performance, flashing textures and character mouths not working properly. 
</p>
<p>
James didn't encounter any outright game-breaking bugs, and as he noted, a bit of technical scruffiness is to be expected from developers who are weathering the real-life invasion of their country. Still, it's good to hear that GSC Game World have already addressed a number of issues in "the last few days", and there are of course patches on the way.
</p>
<p>
In an email today, GSC Game World claimed that they'd fixed 1125 individual issues since dispatching the review code, ranging from crashing problems to full-on progress blockers. 
</p>
<p>
Some highlights from the changelog: they've quashed a softlock dialogue issue that left you unable to leave one conversation, a problem with missing weapon sound effects, and a glitch that made dead bodies behave in unsightly ways, such as striking A-poses. They've also stopped the game spawning quest scenarios right under the player's nose, and nixed an issue whereby players would accidentally change their reputation with one NPC faction.
</p><p>
As for cosmetic enhancements, GSC Game World say they've cleaned up the UI and animations during dialogue and tweaked the lighting. They've also addressed some performance issues, including a freezing problem during busier cutscenes or when exploring crowded areas, while working to improve the overall frame rate and loading times.
</p>
<p>
Going by James's review and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 reviews in general, all this is just scratching the surface. GSC Game World sending us a list of things they've already fixed right before the embargo lift feels a bit cheeky - they're trying to head off criticism at the pass. But I can't blame them for wanting players to get a sense of the game's current status as it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">lands on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few wasteland gremlins GSC Game World hope to corner and slaughter in the first few patches - there's one coming "shortly after release", to be followed by a series of hotfixes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Just Like the Good Old Days: Emitter in Faust's Cell is indistinguishable from regular mesh and surroundings making it difficult for the player to notice important quest item while progressing through" quest.
</p>
<p>
- The Freedom Colosseum: Player unable to take a part in the fourth round on the arena despite having all preconditions met 
</p>
<p>
- Game Settings &amp; Controls: Keybinding for flashlight activation can not be changed upon entering keyboard settings
</p>
<p>
- Title stability: On some rare occasions title may close unexpectedly right after choosing difficulty setting
</p>
<p>
- Memory Leak caused issues with facials: a memory leak and a visual bug that occurred when the tick of montage instances was disabled while the Face was not rendered.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I personally enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hello-rockstar-please-make-an-open-world-based-on-my-unplayable-xbox-edition-of-red-dead-redemption">roving around in very buggy gameworlds</a>, especially post-apocalyptic landscapes that are subject to reality distortions, where the dipping of the frame rate and the deranging of the textures just feels like scene-setting. But that comes with the important caveat that I am generally being paid to play them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Heart Of Chornobyl appears to be an engrossing shooter for all its programming warts and bunions. Here's a closing excerpt from James's review: 
</p>
<p>
"I've been battered and sometimes frustrated by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, but ultimately there is something admirable about its commitment to challenging you - especially when it simultaneously provides just enough tools to avoid becoming unfair. Between that, its punchy shooting, and some properly superb atmosphere-building, it's done enough to earn the mantle of Good Game."
