            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have just released a trailer for the first season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> post-launch content, including a peek at the massive Blackwell Fields map and a new game mode.</p>
<p>Blackwell Fields is a gigantic map set on an air base in California, where air and land vehicles will be available in large-scale game modes. Covered in oil wells, much of the map will be on fire too, which should add some spice to your online matches.</p>
<p>In addition Season One is coming with Strikepoint. This new game mode is a 4v4 occasion, where each player gets one life per round. There are also going to be new weapons and vehicles coming with the Season One update, including the APC, the SQR-300 Carbine, the Mini Fix sniper rifle, and the GGH-22 pistol. Lastly, two new attachments are coming to the game. These are the LPVO sight and the Rail Cover.</p>

			<p>The next-gen Xbox system will be <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium and high-end experience</a>, but it sounds like the experience won't be the only premium element of the console. As suggested by known AMD insider Kepler L2 on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/">NeoGAF forums</a>, the price of the system could easily hit well above the $1000 mark, due to a few reasons, including its high bill of materials, which is considerably higher than that of the Xbox Series X.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000">Next-gen Xbox "Magnus" Bill of Materials May Push its Price Well Beyond $1000</h2>



<p>Commenting on the next-generation system, which will be powered by the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">AMD "Magnus" APU</a>, the known AMD leaker, who has provided accurate information in the past and pointed insights into upcoming AMD hardware, said that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-sarah-bond.1689342/post-270918219">the price of the next Xbox will 100% be over $999.</a> </p>



<p>As things stand, the system's bill of materials (the raw cost of the physical system) is over twice that of the Xbox Series X, which is currently $650. As if this weren't enough, if the next-gen Xbox Magnus will indeed support Steam and 3rd party stores as rumored, Microsoft won't be able to subsidize selling the system at a low or near brea-even price with the guaranteed 30% cut on every game sold on the system.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-gen-xbox-magnus-high-price-may-impact-sony-s-playstation-6">The Next-gen Xbox "Magnus" High Price May Impact Sony's PlayStation 6</h2>



<p>The high price of the next generation Microsoft system, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-prices-and-a-sense-of-broken-trust-will-likely-have-lasting-consequences-for-the-wider-xbox-brand-says-analyst/">current perception of the brand</a>, which is at an-time low following price increases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">Xbox hardware</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass service</a>, and the cancellation of multiple projects which have led to studio closures and multiple waves of layoffs, may also impact the PlayStation 6 and Sony's general strategy for the next generation.</p>



<p>Asked about the possibility of the release of a PlayStation 6 Digital Edition without a disc drive at a lower price that the main edition of the system, Kepler L2 said that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-sarah-bond.1689342/post-270919867">it would only be possible at a significant loss</a>, as the Japanese company essentially no longer has competition, considering the current state of the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Although the next-gen Xbox may end up being one of the most expensive gaming systems ever released, the system has a high chance of being the most powerful to date as well. Judging from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">leaked system specifications</a>, the console won't massively outperform the PlayStation 6, but will still be able to offer the premium version of the performance the Sony system will offer, something that would definitely fall in line with recent statements from Xbox CEO Sarah Bond.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-thumbs-up-for-new-conquest-maps-thumbs-down-for-the-new-modes.1331671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Battlefield 6 is out and in players hands, EA and Battlefield Studios are ready to look to what's next for the game, beginning with its Season 1 update, which comes with three stages of updates that'll carry Battlefield 6 through to the end of this year.</p>



<p>Season 1 for Battlefield 6 begins on October 28, 2025, and ahead of that arrival, I got the chance to get a closer look at everything that's coming to the game beginning October 28 all the way through to December 9, and go hands on with the new modes, vehicles, maps, and weapons that'll be added throughout Season 1.</p>



<p>As a note, I got ample time to review and go over the details EA shared of what's coming in Season 1 for Battlefield 6, and only three hours to play the new content for myself. I also had time to go over the details before I went hands-on with the Season 1 content, which is why the first section of this preview is an overview of everything broken up by each of Season 1's main updates, followed by my impressions.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-1-preview-thumbs-up-for-new-conquest-maps-thumbs-down-for-the-new-modes">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Preview - Thumbs Up for New Conquest Maps, Thumbs Down for the New Modes</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-leadoff-rogue-ops">The Leadoff - Rogue Ops</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Blackwell Fields. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Season 1 will last for at least the rest of 2025, but all of Season 1's content won't arrive in one big batch on October 28. It'll arrive in three separate content updates, with Rogue Ops on October 28, California Resistance on November 18, and Winter Offensive on December 9. </p>



<p>Starting with Rogue Ops, the key additions of which are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blackwell Fields (new map)</li>



<li>Strikepoint (new game mode)</li>



<li>Traverser Mark 2 (new ground vehicle)</li>



<li>SOR-300SC (new carbine weapon)</li>



<li>GGH-22 (new sidearm pistol)</li>



<li>Mini Scout (new sniper rifle)</li>



<li>Rail Cover and LPVO (new attachments)</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest addition that comes with Rogue Ops, only because Rogue Ops is the first of Season 1's updates, is the addition of Battlefield 6's battle pass. The battle pass will have four different paths for players to work through, each with their own free and premium rewards. It's EA and Battlefield Studios' attempt at giving you more choice, so you're working towards the rewards you want sooner, instead of going through a single long list of rewards, many of which you might not care about. You also get a fifth path after finishing the first four.</p>



<p>Though it's worth wondering if breaking up that one long list into five shorter ones will actually make you feel like you're not drudging through rewards you don't care about to get to the ones you do. I guess we'll find out on the 28th. </p>



<p>Rogue Ops' other two highly notable additions are its new map, Blackwell Fields, which Battlefield Studios describes as a map "<em>built for all-out warfare</em>," adding to the maps designed especially for Battlefield's signature Conquest game mode.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Blackwell Fields. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Strikepoint is the second of the two notable additions to Battlefield 6 in Rogue Ops. It is a 4v4, no-respawn mode in which teams compete to capture a single control point. Rounds are won by either eliminating the enemy team or capturing the control point. The first to win six rounds wins the match.</p>



<p>It's a play on the classic search-and-destroy game mode we've seen for years, and it'll be interesting to see how the combat meta changes since it's not necessarily about defusing or arming a bomb, but controlling an area of the map.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-s-on-deck-california-resistance">What's on Deck - California Resistance</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Eastwood. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After Rogue Ops, California Resistance will arrive on November 18, bringing along with it:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eastwood (new map)</li>



<li>Sabotage (new limited-time mode)</li>



<li>Battle Pickups (new gameplay feature)</li>



<li>DB-12 (new shotgun)</li>



<li>M357 Trait (new revolver sidearm)</li>



<li>Troy Angled (new attachment)</li>
</ul>



<p>Eastwood doesn't bring players to a large field for its battles, but a California suburb where you'll be running through living rooms and across suburban hills and running through a nearby golf course to try and get an angle on your enemy.</p>



<p>Unlike Strikepoint, which is a new permanent mode for Battlefield 6, Sabotage, the mode that'll be coming with California Resistance, will only be available for a limited time. Sabotage is an 8v8 mode where one side has to defend supply caches and the other attacks them, with teams switching sides between attacking and defending each round. The team that destroys the most caches the quickest wins the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lastly, Battle Pickups are a key addition in California Resistance. They're a new form of weapons cache coming to Battlefield 6 matches that are high-powered weapons with limited ammo that can help give players an edge in a match if they find one of them.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-the-hole-winter-offensive">In the Hole - Winter Offensive</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Brooklyn Winter Event. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For some reason, in what I thought would be a look at everything to come in Season 1 for Battlefield 6, EA and Battlefield Studios shared no details during this embargoed preview time for Winter Offensive. </p>



<p>We know<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/">, based on the roadmap image we saw ahead of the game's launch</a>, that the Brooklyn map is getting a snowy refresh as a limited-time event map, and that there will be a limited-time event called Ice Lock with the arrival of Winter Offensive. Players will also get a new melee weapon, an ice climbing axe.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Brooklyn Winter Event. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But beyond that, we didn't see anything else about Winter Offensive, which was pretty disappointing. Maybe the team wants to hold something back because by then, Battlefield 6 will be going head-to-head with Call of Duty, and EA wants to have some major surprise to keep players from jumping over to Black Ops 7.</p>



<h3 id="h-hands-on-impressions">Hands-On Impressions</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the good, the Conquest variants of the new maps, Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge. Admittedly, I'm a little upset that Eastwood isn't coming until November 18; it's arguably the best map in Battlefield 6, and it's technically not even in the game yet, but Blackwell Ridge is no slouch.</p>



<p>Its sunset setting and rolling hills make it a classic sniper and vehicle playground, and it's genuinely one of the most eye-catching maps in the whole game because of its constant sunset.</p>



<p>Eastwood, for its part, is just a lot more fun to run around in and has a few great hubs where battles for control points can flow throughout a match and find that sweet spot of Battlefield where there's an exciting ebb and flow to the gameplay between both sides. Also, it's just fun to drive around in a golf cart and get kills as you go.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1 Eastwood. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The new SOR-300SC carbine rifle is a solid addition to the arsenal though it doesn't immediately shoot up to being above my regular choices, even when I tried out different versions with all of the attachments available.</p>



<p>The Mini Scout is a different story, however, since it's arguably going to be the best sniper rifle in the game when it arrives on October 28. Easily my favourite sniper rifle to use, and incredibly powerful.</p>



<p>Overall, I'm just thrilled that the large-scale versions of Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge are as good as they are. Which is why the variants you play on for both the new permanent Strikepoint mode and the limited-time Sabotage modes are all the more disappointing.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Strikepoint and Sabotage both took place on linear, small-scale versions of Eastwood and Blackwell Ridge. While Eastwood retains the neighbourhood feel, with its high walls and corners to duck around, the Blackwell Ridge map is much more open and feels much less suited for the mode. Both maps have one respawn point at either end, making it easy for either team to start shooting at you the moment you respawn (particularly when playing Sabotage), and neither feels like they successfully shrunk down what's appealing about the full, large-scale map in these condensed versions.</p>



<p>The poor quality of the maps also further exacerbates the fact that Strikepoint and Sabotage are just plain boring, really. Paired with the lacking map variants, Strikepoint's play on classic search-and-destroy make it nowhere near as enticing as the best search-and-destroy game modes. I'm not asking for Battlefield Studios to add an economy system, buying weapons and armour each round, etc., just something more than a single control point in the middle of an uninteresting map (particularly the Blackwell Ridge map) that keeps the matches from becoming deafeningly repetitive and boring.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I think the switch from making it about bomb arming and defusal to making it a point you have to defend is an interesting one, but due to Strikepoint's setup of one control point in the same place every match, it was genuinely putting me to sleep during the last hour of the three-hour play session we had with the Season 1 content. It was a major letdown after having a blast playing on Conquest on two excellent new maps for two hours.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this isn't the part where I say, 'don't worry, Sabotage is actually fun.' It's fine. It can be a good time, particularly because the 8v8 structure allows for a bit more dynamic and chaotic combat simply because there are more people in the match, but overall, the mode didn't make for exciting matches.</p>



<p>I think part of my problem with both these modes is that neither of them is what I look to Battlefield for. It's not that I don't appreciate EA and Battlefield Studios trying new things; I just don't like what they've tried. I'm happy with the new weapons, I'm happy with the new maps, but I can live without the new modes. I'll certainly give Strikepoint another try, especially if there are better map variants for it from maps like Brooklyn, Mirak Valley, and New Sobek City. But if you're a fan of search-and-destroy, you're probably better off sticking with whatever your go-to shooter is for that mode.</p>



<h3 id="h-keeping-up-the-momentum">Keeping Up the Momentum</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6, Season 1. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now that Battlefield 6 has been in players' hands for nearly two weeks and we're days away from its live service engine springing to life with the introduction of its battle pass, the goal for EA and Battlefield Studios is to keep the momentum that <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">its stellar commercial launch started</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see if the pacing of Season 1's content on top of everything else players already love about the game is exactly what Battlefield 6 needs to keep itself in fighting shape for when Call of Duty arrives. I think Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood will both be huge for the variety of what's available in Battlefield 6, and hopefully, for EA's sake, people like Strikepoint a hell of a lot more than I did when it arrives.</p>



<p>As a side note, while I can't wait for Eastwood, I can't help but appreciate the timing of its arrival. Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, four days before Eastwood is set to launch in Battlefield 6. The headquarters offices for both EA and Activision are based in California, not to mention Ripple Effect, one of the teams that worked on Battlefield 6, is also based in California. A map all about a battle on Californian soil launching on November 18 can't help but feel a little symbolic of what's to come.</p>

The news comes in the aftermath of a disappointing launch for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/689333/fbc-firebreak-review-xbox-ps5-steam"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, the Finnish studio’s first foray into multiplayer gaming. Virtala will be replaced on an interim basis by Markus Mäki, Remedy’s chief product officer and one of the studio’s co-founders. The studios says it will “initiate a search process for a new CEO immediately.”</p><p>Virtala took over the role back in 2016, and was a key figure behind Remedy’s transformation over the past decade, as it shifted from a work-for-hire studio to one that developed multiple projects simultaneously and owned and published its own games. This period was highlighted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the launch of <em>Control</em> in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the long-awaited sequel to <em>Alan Wake</em> in 2023</a>.</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> was meant to be a major part of this transformation, a self-published spinoff of <em>Control</em> that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox">an attempt to marry the studio’s worldbuilding and storytelling with a live-service co-op shooter</a>. However, the combination didn’t win over players and, despite launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/784967/remedy-fbc-firebreak-update">a major update in September</a>, two weeks ago <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy issued a profit warning</a> due to “weak sales” of <em>Firebreak</em>.</p></div><p>Part of the impetus behind Remedy’s shift to a multi-project studio — in addition to <em>Firebreak</em>, it’s also currently developing <em>Control 2</em>, remasters of <em>Max Payne</em>, and a mystery game — was to help it deal with potential flops like <em>Firebreak</em>, though Virtala told me ahead of the game’s launch that, even still, each release was still significant for the independent studio. “Every single game is highly important for us,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/691964/remedy-entertainment-profile-alan-wake-control-fbc-firebreak">Virtala told <em>The Verge</em></a>. “There is no question that we are not fully insulated.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2006’s <i>Scarface: The World is Yours</i> is back! Well, maybe. It’s complicated. Possibly illegal. See, the <i>Vice City</i>-lookin’ open-world action-adventure game for PS2, Xbox, and Wii recently resurfaced on Steam and the Epic Games Store. That’s (possibly) good news if you like diving into some gaming deep tracks from the early 21st Century. But it’s bad news if you’re the rights holder to this game because you didn’t give anyone permission to do this.</p> <p>Arriving on Steam and EGS, the loose adaptation of the legendary gangster film is back courtesy of a publisher named EC Digital Entertainment, who promises some graphical upgrades to the 2006 game (yes, they’re “AI-assisted”). But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scarface-pc-re-release-unintentionally-pushed-live-early-on-epic-with-steam-to-follow-but-i-may-smell-a-rat">as <i>Rock Paper Shotgun </i>documents</a>, EC Digital Entertainment doesn’t have much of a history. Based in Hong Kong, their website is blocked for whatever reason, and their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube page</a> is filled with so many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">tumbleweeds</a> it’s giving me <i>Arc Raiders</i> PTSD flashbacks. What’s more, this version of <i>Scarface</i> includes some QoL mods baked in <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">without permission from its creators</a>, one of whom is clearly stating “the holder of the <i>Scarface </i>license wasn’t willing to re-release the game.” So how did this happen?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This release reportedly ships SilentPatch and Fusion Fix, and none of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice).</p> <p>I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. <a href="https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p">https://t.co/eDCWkKys4p</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>We love a mystery.</p> <p>As flummoxed as any of us by this strange news, the creator of <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> dug in a bit more to <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465">find out that the author</a> of one of the included mods was contacted. However, they also found that the “Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware [of the Steam and EGS listing]” and that the store pages launched prematurely.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's what I found out so far:<br>* TAG (Fusion Fix author) WAS contacted, they were unable to reach me because of a lost Discord friend invite (despite my e-mail being public)<br>* Movie IP rights holder appears to be unaware of this<br>* Store listings were put early in error</p> <p>Oh boy. <a href="https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A">https://t.co/1aaYiyOD2A</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1980979864707719465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weird stuff for sure. You can buy the EGS version right now, though the Steam listing still says “coming soon.”</p> <p>As for the game itself, I faintly remember seeing the box art on store shelves back in the 2000s and at the time thought, “Why wouldn’t I just play <i>GTA</i>?” Al Pacino lent his likeness and personally chose his voice replacement for Tony Montana, but a few other actors from the movie did reprise their roles. Critical reception of the game was mostly positive, hovering around 7’s out of 10’s, with the occasional 6 and one 4.5 out of 10 from <i>Official Xbox Magazine</i>. Sequels and a PSP and Xbox 360 version were planned, but later scrapped.</p> <p>I like seeing old games, possible hidden gems, return from eons past. But it sounds like this rerelease of <i>Scarface</i> might be best avoided for now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose-2000638177</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-dumps-the-1000xm4-at-50-off-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-or-bose.1331653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones typically demand $400 or more, and Apple’s AirPods Max is sitting at $549. Sony just quietly <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropped the WH-1000XM4 to an all-time low of $198 on Amazon (down from $348)</a>, which makes these legendary headphones <strong>roughly three times cheaper than AirPods Max</strong> and significantly less expensive than current Bose or Sonos models.</p>
<p>Sure, Sony released the newer 1000XM6 but the upgrades are incremental at best, and this model cost more than double what you’ll pay for the XM4 right now. For daily commuting, office work or travel, the 1000XM4 delivers the same core noise-canceling technology that made Sony’s 1000X series the benchmark everyone else tries to match.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the XM4 Still Competes with Newer Models</h2>
<p>Dual noise sensor technology <strong>employs external and internal microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate ambient noise</strong> with surprising accuracy. External mics pick up external noise such as airplane engines, traffic, or air-conditioning systems, and internal mics are listening for what actually ends up in your ear and make adjustments on the fly. This dual-pronged attack creates an area of silence that’s truly impressive, eliminating low-rumble growl of engine noise and higher-pitched chatter of nearby conversations. <strong>Noise cancellation of the XM4 stays on par with the XM5 and XM6 in practical application</strong>, where the variance is slight enough most people would only pick up on the difference by direct comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 30 hours with noise cancellation active</strong>&nbsp;which covers multiple cross-country flights or weeks of daily commuting before you need to recharge. Quick charging adds another convenience layer: a 10-minute charge via the included USB-C cable delivers five hours of playback, so even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up during breakfast gets you through the day. <strong>This battery performance beats AirPods Max</strong>&nbsp;which manage around 20 hours and lack any fast-charging capability.</p>



<p><em>Speak-to-Chat</em> is one of those features where you think it’s just gimmicky until you actually use it every day. The <strong>headphones sense you beginning to speak and instantly mute your music</strong> and lower noise cancellation so you can hear the person on the other end perfectly. Once you’ve finished speaking, music plays again instantly once silence has lasted for some seconds. This comes in super handy for short conversations with baristas, coworkers visiting your desk, or your family questioning you, so you don’t have to physically mute and take off your headphones to have short conversations.</p>



<p>Excellent call quality results <strong>from five integrated microphones and sophisticated audio signal processing</strong> that separates your voice from noise. Those on the receiving end of calls are able to hear you naturally even where the situation is noisy, e.g., on busy roads or windy situations. Beamforming technology in the microphone array zeroes in on your voice and mutes the noise, and this is key where you are working from home or where you take your calls while commuting.</p>
<p>Multipoint connection <strong>allows you to pair the XM4s with two devices at once</strong> so you can be connected to your laptop to get your job done and your phone so you can take calls. Audio seamlessly switches to whatever device actually has content playing, so the phone call cuts your laptop music without you having to switch it by hand. This ends the constant dance of re-pairing your single-connection headphones have to go through every time you switch between devices.</p>
<p>At $198, the <strong>1000XM4 represents roughly 36% of the price you pay for AirPods Max</strong> but provides the same or superior noise cancellation, increased battery life, and additional features.</p>

<p>With less than a week until its launch, the Battlefield 6 Season 1 trailer has been released, previewing what’s to come for players. </p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives players a first look at the new Blackwell Fields map along with the Strikepoint game mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Season 1 rolls out in three phases with new hardware, gadgets, maps, and monthly drops for Portal,”</strong> EA said. <strong>“Blackwell Fields spans besieged facilities and homesteads under a burning horizon, supporting all combat sizes with land and air. Eastwood turns a quiet villa and golf retreat into a frontline, with land vehicles and helicopters in play.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 starts with the aforementioned new map and mode, along with three new weapons, a new attachment, and a new vehicle. The new weapons coming to the game are the SOR-300SC rifle, GGH-22 pistol, and the Mini Scout sniper rifle.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-review.1331644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have time to talk about my lord and saviour, PowerWash Simulator? The unexpected cult hit hooked weirdos like me back in 2022 with its relaxing, satisfying premise; clean dirt off things. Has the sequel, PowerWash Simulator 2, changed the fundamental act of power washing? Has it given new meaning to slowly blasting graffiti off a wall? Will it make you question what it truly means to be filthy in 2025? No. And thank Mr. Clean for that, because it's the simplicity that makes it so satisfying. What you do get is what fans like me - I've got over 400 hours logged in the original - really needed; some quality of life upgrades and lots of new things to wash. I can see myself racking up another 400 hours on this installment easily. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed out the first time, it really is as straightforward as it sounds. You are given a vehicle or location to clean, a selection of power washers (they all function the same way, just with varying power), soap, and if a level is feeling saucy, some ladders. You choose your washer, your nozzle (I'm a green girl, yellow for detail work, any one who uses white wasn't loved enough by their mother), and you're left to clean at your own pace, sluicing down sections in whatever way you please. One of the real beauties of PowerWash Simulator is that you can't eff it up. As long as you're blasting water at dirt, eventually things will get clean. Even if you never upgraded anything, you'd still get there in the end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big headline for the sequel is all the new cleaning jobs to work your way through, and they don't disappoint. There are vehicles like a mobility scooter or a car decorated like a dog; there are buildings like bandstands, public toilets, and grand houses; and there are even new multi-stage jobs where you'll need to clean a particular part of a map to reveal a new area. There is the perfect balance of large buildings and complex structures, for when I wanted to spend a solid hour spraying, alongside smaller vehicles for a quicker splash of dopamine. Less exciting for purists like me is the addition of a home base you can decorate (with items you get to wash first) and some pet cats. I mean, everyone likes virtual pets, but unless I can tie mops to their feet I have no interest in them when I'm busy jetwashing a billboard. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's the perfect balance of large buildings and smaller vehicles to clean. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll understand the beautiful mundanity of this game when I tell you that one of the most exciting innovations is that soap is now free and multipurpose. Not just a blow against capitalism, it actually removes one of the biggest annoyances about the first game. Soap had to be purchased, came in limited quantities, and a different soap was required for each surface. Now you just switch to the soap attachment and any surface, on any job, can be your own personal foam party as it breaks down tough stains. I've gone from a soap dodger to a detergent dilettante. While you're cleaning there are also new icons to help you track down things that still need polishing up, which might sound minor, but as someone who spent hours of their life looking for a 1% speck of dirt on a huge restroom wall, I am hugely grateful for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other new tricks in your cleaning kit similarly make things that were a bit of a fiddle or a grind easier, without letting you skip the work. There's an abseiling rig for large structures like billboards, a cherry picker lift so you're not balancing on ladders to get to hard to reach areas, and a spinning surface cleaner - you know, like school janitors mysteriously push around after hours - to make polishing up large flat surfaces a little less daunting. There are even tiny tweaks, like that tall scaffolding now has a ladder on the outside when you just want to get to the top, no more zig zagging up and down. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PowerWash Simulator 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's key is that the improvements aren't about speeding you through the jobs more quickly or letting you skip chunks, because the whole point of PowerWash Simulator 1 and 2 is the meditative flow state you achieve just working away at the grime and graffiti, back and forth, up and down, all with the gentle hiss of water accompanying your progress. It's underrated as an ASMR experience, although you will need to pee every 10 minutes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've yet to discover the wonders of jet washing random buildings and vehicles, good news; there's no lore you have to catch up on. The loose story is delivered through text messages while you're working, but you could skip them all without a problem. They usually explain why you're cleaning, for instance, a street sweeper covered in huckleberry jelly, or will give you weird information about the area. There are some nice touches for devotees of the original, too. A shooting gallery has miniature versions of the landmarks you'll recognize, and the chatter will reference the iconic merman statue or strange temple. It's nonsense, but it's nonsense I appreciated. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Line up ladies and gentlemen, and see the rare example of a sequel to a special game that knew just what to tweak, and what to leave well enough alone. The meditative motions of cleaning, the silly sense of humor, and the sense of satisfaction. There's enough here to justify slapping a big old 2 on the end of the title, but the key mechanic and feeling of the first game lives on.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-2-review]]></content:encoded>

It guides players towards the new space wrecks, is a great way to salvage some new rare ship parts, while uncovering a spooky story - suitable for the Halloween season!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No Man's Sky Breach Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has been a crazy year for the No Man’s Sky team and we’re so proud and pleased to be able to continue working on this game we all love so much nine years after launch.Seeing so many folks enjoying Voyagers has really inspired us, and we can’t wait for you to see what we have in store in future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years"><u>explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Man's Sky Breach update 6.10 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">BUG FIXES AND QOL</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that could cause the player to be ejected into space if on an internal stair in a corvette while the pulse drive was active.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the corvette "current flightpath" autopilot from cancelling when the ship came into proximity of a large object such as a Space Station.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented exiting the corvette pilot seat in the Space Station and Space Anomaly when using the Quick Menu in VR.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented stairs in corvettes from being traversable using VR teleport movement.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused weapons to be misaligned with the crosshair when flying a corvette in first person.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the corvette teleporter to persist after the corvette had landed on a planetary surface.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause water to behave erratically when teleporting from a corvette into water.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused newly-assembled corvettes to appear at the wrong scale if another owned Corvette was docked nearby.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause corvette interior doorways to become blocked.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the corvette Torpedo Launcher module from correctly installing the Rocket Launcher weapon.</li><li>Fixed some corvette structural modules appearing under the exterior decoration category of the build menu.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue that could cause corvette assembly data to be replaced with planetary base data.</li><li>Improved the placement of corvette-class ships when teleporting to a Settlement with a corvette as the primary ship.</li><li>Improved the behaviour of floating exotic creatures, especially in response to being offered Creature Pellets.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could prevent biological monstrosities on derelict freighters from reacting aggressively to nearby Travellers.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could prevent some varieties of hazardous flora appearing on planets.</li><li>Fixed a timing-specific issue that could cause the player's wanted level to get stuck when using the pulse drive to exit planetary atmosphere.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the current primary ship's thrusters to be used for launch fuel calculations when attempting to summon other ships from the Quick Menu.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused refiners to reset their requested output value to the maximum when refining was started.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the Personal Refiner from automatically starting when an input substance was inserted from the Inventory screen.</li><li>Improved the error messaging when attempting to install duplicate technology in the inventory.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused rain to be audible when standing inside a corvette.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could prevent the Corvette Assembly tutorial from starting in abandoned star systems.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause Exosuit upgrade stations to lose their interaction prompt after a single use, especially in Abandoned Mode.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause misleading instructional text during missions requiring planets with extreme weather conditions.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused some markers to persist unnecessarily in excavation and flora extermination missions from the Corvette Mission Radar.</li><li>Fixed a number of minor messaging inconsistencies in missions requiring the player to prepare ingredients in the Nutrient Processor.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ART AND VISUALS</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that could cause large waves to abruptly appear and disappear on the surface of water.</li><li>Improved lighting transitions when changing environments -

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/news/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> will officially launch on December 1, and two more characters are joining its roster. Tribute Games and developer Dotemu revealed that Phoenix and Iron Man will team up with fellow heroes like Captain America, She-Hulk, Wolverine, and Spider-Man, increasing the total number of playable heroes to 15. Phoenix--X-man Jean Grey's cosmic powerhouse alter-ego--can dish out telekinetic blasts, while Iron Man uses bleeding-edge technology to clear the field of enemies.</p><p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth's mightiest mortals take on Annihilus as he launches a new campaign to take over the galaxy. Dotemu had previously worked on another licensed property, the well-received Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge for PC and console.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itVLfmX3Ts8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589194,1300-4589195,1300-4589196,1300-4589197,1300-4589198,1300-4589199,1300-4589200" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"></figure><p>The Marvel game has a beat-'em-up design at its core, and each character can pull off unique attacks.

                <p>In a <a href="https://rollingstone.com.br/noticia/hideo-kojima-criar-jogos-e-cansativo-mas-sinto-que-estou-realmente-vivendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, game creator Hideo Kojima kicked off a firestorm on social media as he shared his thoughts on the future of the industry. Kojima warned that relying too heavily on remaking old franchises is creatively risky and that, in the future, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI will likely be used to create these kinds of projects</a>. </p><p>Kojima has already said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he doesn’t see AI as a threat</a>, though. Instead, he believes it can be a helpful tool for handling repetitive tasks, allowing human creators to focus on more imaginative work. Kojima explained that he sees AI as a "friend" in development, one that improves efficiency without replacing human leadership in creativity.</p><p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto strongly disagrees with Kojima's prediction. Okamoto stated that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=gamespot+silent+hill+f&amp;udm=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill f</a>, the latest game in the franchise, could not have been made by AI. While AI might be able to generate ideas for sequels, Okamoto believes it cannot make bold creative decisions, such as changing the setting to 1960s Japan or involving acclaimed horror writer Ryukishi07. These choices, he says, came from human insight and vision--something AI simply can't replicate at this point.</p><p>"AI may be able to put together a project for a sequel that takes place in the Silent Hill universe, but things like changing the story's setting to Japan or getting Ryukishi07 on board as a writer are the kind of bold choices AI would never be able to make," Okamoto said (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ai-could-never-come-up-with-a-sequel-like-silent-hill-f-series-producer-joins-discussion-on-ai-generated-remakes-and-sequels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton translation</a>). </p><p>Silent Hill f is a significant shift for the series, moving away from the familiar town and instead focusing on a deeply personal horror story set in historical Japan. The game follows Hinako Shimizu, a teenager dealing with overwhelming pressure from those around her. Since its release in late September, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/" data-ref-id="1100-6535077">has sold over 1 million copies</a> and received mostly positive reviews. </p><p>The debate surrounding AI in gaming has gained momentum recently, particularly with advancements in generative AI, such as Sora. Fans have utilized these tools to create parody content featuring popular franchises such as Mario and Pokemon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sora-2-ai-mario-and-pikachu-videos-seem-primed-for-nintendo-lawsuits/1100-6535191/" data-ref-id="1100-6535191">sparking concerns from companies like Nintendo regarding copyright infringement</a>. Despite the controversy, developers like Kojima and Glen Schofield (creator of Dead Space) continue to advocate for AI as a valuable tool. Schofield said that after experimenting with AI for two years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he sees it as a way to improve speed</a>, reduce costs, and support developers, not as a replacement for them.</p>

<p>Not only is this price coming into effect immediately, The Verge understands this will impact developers in Europe and elsewhere, not just the US.</p>
<p>The price hike follows price increases in recent months for both the Xbox console and its flagship subscription Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>
<p>In the US, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">cost of both the Xbox Series X and S consoles increased</a> from 3rd October - the disc-playing Series X model now costs $649.99, an increase of $50.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">Game Pass Ultimate, meanwhile, increased by over 50 percent</a> - in the UK it now costs £22.99 per month. This is the top tier of the subscription, though PC Game Pass also increased in price. Some countries are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-wont-affect-existing-subscribers-in-some-countries-for-now-microsoft-confirms">yet to see the price increase</a>.</p>
<p>As The Verge explained, the Xbox dev kit is already expensive due to additional hardware to allow developers to test their games for both the Series X and S models.</p>

<p>"Microsoft is thriving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">claimed CEO and chairman Satya Nadella</a>, following layoffs across the business in July.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a free update to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> coming next month, but it doesn't include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>The update will add a Photo Mode using the new field camera item, with players able to adjust angles and customise images with various decorations.</p>
<p>Decor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> will also be added. Originally seen in mobile game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a>, these Pikmin are hidden around levels to be discovered and transferred to your squad - they can also be transferred to the mobile game.</p>

<p>Lastly, new Creature Activity levels will be added. In Relaxed mode, enemies won't attack unless you attack first, allowing for a breezier challenge, while in Fierce mode they'll be more aggressive.</p>
<p>Though there's no date, the update will arrive in November along with a new demo to try out.</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-posts-cute-and-mysterious-animated-short-film-but-is-it-teasing-pikmin">mysterious animated short shared earlier this month called Close to You</a>, which showed a baby being (somewhat) terrorised by invisible creatures. Fans rightly guessed these were Pikmin, and a revised version including the plant critters was published the following day.</p><p>As such, some form of Pikmin news has been expected. But most fans had anticipated an upgraded version of Pikmin 4 for Switch 2 - something Nintendo has released for many of its games, including the two open-world Zelda games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is also getting an expanded version next year.</p>
<p>But not so Pikmin 4. While the game is playable on the Switch 2, there's no specific upgrade.</p>
<p>Still, it remains a brilliant game on the system. "The Pikmin series blossoms anew, in a bouquet of fresh gameplay and the best bits from its roots," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pikmin-4-review-nintendos-oft-overlooked-garden-strategy-reaches-near-perfect-evolution">five star review of Pikmin 4</a>.</p>

		<p>Hello Games has announced and launched a new update for No Man’s Sky, calling it Breach. The Breach Expedition is a limited time event that will run for three weeks, taking players to an abandoned universe filled with corvette wrecks that can be salvaged for parts. The end goal of the expedition is to find the Fireship Arcadia, but to get there players will need to venture into hostile environments including the purple star systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Breach Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNaY10DQkJw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The purple star solar systems were first teased in the Worlds Part II update, and players venturing to these areas will need to be fully prepared as these are pretty hostile areas environmentally. The prizes of stripping the Corvette wrecks may be worth it though. Equipped with your multi-tool laser you will able to take parts from the wrecks and use them to build ships at a Corvette Workshop. The items you can get as scrap include landing gear, shields, weapons, connectors, and wedge-shaped modules. The rewards going into the Breach include Event Horizon, Eternal Serpents, and Siren of the Stars posters, Aeron Cowling and Aeron Diffuser hull plates, the Atlas-themed Wings of Aeron wing module, the Aeron Drive &amp; Aeron Blade,&nbsp; the decorative Aeron Winglet, Aeron Pillar &amp; Aeron Pyramid, the Aeron Starship exhaust trail and the Aeron Powershield which can boosts your ship’s defences.</p>
<p>Fixes have also been released since the launch of Voyagers, with Hello Games improving snapping, making collisions more robust, and adding the option to apply a colour palette to a Corvette at the workshop.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-cuts-50-off-for-final-clearance-sale-2000638162</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Missing a package delivery because you didn’t hear the doorbell or weren’t sure if someone actually rang feels frustrating, especially when you’ve been waiting days for that shipment. The Ring battery doorbell <em>Plus</em> solves this by giving you real-time alerts, two-way communication with visitors and a full head-to-toe video view of whoever’s standing at your door – all accessible from your phone no matter where you are. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/">just slashed it to an all-time low of $79 (down from $149), making this one of the most affordable ways to add smart home security</a> to your front entrance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4926/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Video From Head-to-Toe Really Matters</h2>
<p>The wider-angle view through the Ring <em>Plus</em> doorbell captures visitors from the head down to the heel, rather than cutting them off at chest level, like most standard doorbells. That makes all the difference when delivery personnel deposit packages at your feet and go or when you’ll be able to determine whether someone’s holding something. <strong>HD+ video resolution gives you higher definition than standard HD</strong> so you’ll be better able to distinguish faces, read package labeling, or make out identifying characteristics on cars parked nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Color night vision</strong> eliminates the guesswork of nighttime visitors. Old-time infrared night vision provides you with grayscale video, making it harder to distinguish clothing colors, type of vehicle, or other details useful for identification. Color night vision performs better under ambient light and amplifies what light you have, providing usable color video even where the light gets low.</p>



<p>Motion detection triggers alerts the moment someone enters your field of view of your doorbell camera so you have early notification even before they press the button. You have the ability to block off some of the zones within the camera view, like your neighbor’s window or the busy sidewalk, so you only get alerts of motions you actually are interested in.</p>
<p>The Quick Release Battery Pack makes recharging simple: You remove the battery,<strong> charge indoors through the normal USB cable and click the battery back into place without removing the whole doorbell</strong>. This setup eclipses hardwired doorbells where your current doorbell cabling is poor or doesn’t exist, and eliminates the requirement to call an electrician to install the doorbell. <strong>Recharge time covers several weeks to months</strong>, dependent on the level of use, and some owners have a second battery kept charged so they can switch immediately without downtime.</p>



<p>Installation involves setting up the doorbell to your door frame or wall by using the hardware provided and plugging it into your WiFi through the Ring application. <strong>Installation typically takes 15-30 minutes</strong> or so for the average person, and you won’t require any special equipment aside from the use of a screwdriver.</p>
<p>With two-way audio, you can speak to delivery people, say to visitors you’ll be there in just a minute or deter suspicious individuals without having to open your door. The quality of the speaker and microphone is good enough for average conversation, and the lag between someone speaking and you hearing it is negligible. Your real-time communication makes the doorbell system an intercom system you can use anywhere you have internet access.</p>
<p>At $79, the Ring doorbell <em>Plus</em> is cheaper than most of the bare-bones doorbells available without any smart features whatsoever.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-offloads-its-xbox-controller-2025-edition-now-cheaper-than-buying-one-game-2000638170</link>

              <p>Controllers wear out, drift develops and replacement costs add up quickly when you’re paying $60-70 for a new one. Microsoft’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Xbox wireless controller just dropped to an all-time low of $49 on Amazon (down from $64)</a> and this isn’t just an Xbox accessory anymore. This controller works across Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android and iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs and even VR headsets which makes it one of the most compatible gaming controllers available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What Makes the 2025 Edition Worth Upgrading To</h2>
<p>The modernized design refines the ergonomics that made Xbox controllers comfortable in the first place with s<strong>culpted surfaces and updated geometry that reduce hand fatigue</strong> during extended gaming sessions. The changes are subtle rather than radical, maintaining the familiar Xbox layout while improving grip points and button placement based on years of user feedback. <strong>Battery life extends up to 40 hours</strong> on a pair of AA batterie, which translates to weeks of gaming for casual players or about a week for heavy users before needing replacements.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid D-pad</strong> is an evolution of functionality beyond earlier Xbox controllers: It integrates the precision of an old-school cross-shaped D-pad and the smooth motion of a circular disc, providing you with increased control while playing fighting games, platformers, and menus. Faceted construction gives you tactile feedback so you’ll be able to learn which way you are pressing without glancing down which makes the difference in fast-paced titles where keeping your eyes on the screen and off your thumbs makes all the difference.<strong> Textured grips on the triggers, the bumpers, and the back case enhance control</strong> while you’re handling intense situations where your hands are likely to be sweaty or you are inputting fast movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>Share button is a quality-of-life addition</strong> that simplifies content creation. Instead of memorizing button combinations to capture screenshots or start recording gameplay, you press one dedicated button. The controller communicates with your device to trigger the native capture function, so screenshots save directly to your Xbox, PC, or mobile device’s storage. For streamers or anyone who shares gameplay clips on social media, this one-button approach eliminates fumbling with menus mid-game and reduces the chances of missing the moment you wanted to capture.</p>
<p>Xbox<strong> wireless and Bluetooth dual connectivity</strong> makes this controller fully cross-platform compatible. Xbox Wireless provides the lowest possible latency connectivity to Xbox consoles and Windows PCs along with Xbox Wireless adapter, and Bluetooth takes care of the rest, including smartphones, tablets, Fire TV sticks, and play-capable smart TVs. You can pair the controller to multiple devices and jump between the same without having to re-pair them every time you switch, and this comes in useful should you play your Xbox in the evenings and your PC during break times.</p>



<p>The 3<strong>.5mm headset jack is still compatible</strong> with any wired gaming headset, so you won’t be bothered with the use of USB adapters or wireless dongles whenever you want personal audio. You just plug in your headphones and audio comes through the controller immediately with volume and chat mix controls accessible through your system settings. The dual-role function of the USB-C connector is to not only have direct wired hookups to consoles or computers for zero-lag input and zero-battery concern, but you can also charge replaceable battery packs should you be using the Play and Charge Kit by Microsoft or even third-party alternatives.</p>
<p>Custom button remapping using the Xbox Accessories app allows you to map any button to another action and this is invaluable for accessibility or personal expression. If you don’t like certain button layouts or would like to map controls better suited to the layout of another game, you have the ability to do so without resorting to the in-game options or those that do not exist.</p>
<p>At $49, the controller is l<strong>ess expensive than budget third-party controllers</strong> but provides you with first-party quality and compatibility on a crazy list of hardware.</p>

<p>Build A Beehive’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, with cash being the most sought-after resource. Read on to find out what the latest Build A Beehive active codes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Build A Beehive is a popular simulation-based tycoon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-ink-game-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where the player is in charge of the complete operation of a bee farm. This includes activities like growing plants, attracting and tending to the bees, producing honey, and, in the end, selling the honey that’s been produced for the maximum possible profit. Players begin the game with a tiny plot of land and are tasked with buying some flavors to plant. </p>



<p>These flowers attract different kinds of bees, and maintaining the right balance is of utmost importance. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to upgrade both their land as well as their farm, using some Build A Beehive codes to get a small boost will certainly be worth the while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Roblox Build A Beehive is a fairly straightforward process, as the developers do not impose any prerequisite steps on the players.

This game, however, has no such steps, and it’s just a matter of inputting one of the codes into the correct text box by navigating through the menus. </p>



<p>For players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming these codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Build A Beehive.</li>



<li>Click the Shop icon on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes into the ‘Codes’ text box.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape From Duckov may sound suspiciously like another game, but it’s very different. It’s why the game has sold like hotcakes, PC players can’t get enough of it, and why its indie status has PlayStation and Xbox owners don’t know if it’s on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>At first glance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Duckov</a> sounds like a novelty rip-off movie from the mid-2000s where everyone was trying to do their own Scary Movie imitation. However, at the core of Escape From Duckov is a very competent extraction shooter with a cute and cuddly theme that bolsters its game world, rather than hindering and overshadowing it.</p>



<p>It rightly takes the bill at launch, and we’re going to duck here so we don’t catch any strays from Escape From Tarkov fans. If you want to know if Escape From Duckov is coming to consoles—specifically PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—let’s take a look at what we know.</p>

<p><strong>As of writing, you can’t play Escape From Duckov on any PlayStation consoles, and this includes the PS4, the PS5, and any of the PlayStation Pro models.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not a matter of consoles being unable to run Escape From Duckov, so you can toss that theory into the pond. Quite simply, Escape From Duckov was coded and developed with PC in mind. First and foremost, it’s a PC title, and it needs to be coded differently for PS4 and PS5 consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-xbox-one-or-xbox-series-s-x">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On Xbox One or Xbox Series S|X?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s the same dilemma for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S owners as Escape From Duckov isn’t on any Xbox device, but the possibility of it arriving in the future can’t be ruled out.</strong></p>



<p>If Escape From Duckov is a huge success (which it more than likely will be), it would make complete sense for a console release. This means the extraction shooter flying onto PlayStation, as well as Xbox consoles—maybe on Game Pass?</p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-escape-from-duckov-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Escape From Duckov On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans are also down bad for Escape From Duckov as the shooter isn’t available on Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>It’s pretty much a case of rinse and repeat for Escape From Duckov on either Nintendo generation. Team Soda’s extraction shooter is probably testing the waters on PC first, and then all console ports could arrive later down the line.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have the latest news on this as and when it happens.</p>



<p>We’ll have the newest details if Escape From Duckov does get a console port right here. Given that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-sold-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 200,000 copies in 24 Hours</a>, and still continues to smash it, we don’t see why it won’t happen.

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is seemingly shutting down Call of Duty-inspired Battlefield 6 Portal maps.</p>



<p>At least one instance seems to show a map based on the Call of Duty map Shipment. In what appears to be a warning email from EA, the company says that after reviewing the user’s account, it saw content it deemed <strong>“inappropriate”</strong> due to it referencing <strong>“third party products in Battlefield 6.”</strong></p>



<p>When going into <a href="https://x.com/GhostGamingG/status/1980936800303468657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more details</a>, the warning specifically mentions <strong>“Shipment first test”</strong> that had a description of “Shipment 2019 edition”.</p>



<p>The email goes on to say that the user can still play, but any future violations will have restrictions put on the account, such as “temporarily or permanently” removing access to EA games and services.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to EA and Battlefield Studios for comment on whether they’re removing all references to other games in the Battlefield 6 portal or if it’s specific to Call of Duty. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts To Palworld’s Guns</p>
      </div>
<p>"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it," he said. "We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."</p><p>It's a bold position, to be sure, especially since other big-name publishers like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA are pushing AI on their workers</a> hard. Still, Buckley is aware that the AI floodgates have opened and believes it'll worsen in time.</p><p>"I think over the next two or three years we're going to get into this weird era--and you can see it slowly happening now on Steam--of really low-quality, AI-made games," he said. "It's something that has plagued other stores but Steam had been good at keeping them out. But it's happening. This wave is coming, and I think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say, 'No, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."</p><p>Pocketpair has been accused of using AI since bursting on the scene in January 2024 with its Pokemon-but-guns game Palworld. Buckley and the rest of the Japanese studio are intimately familiar with AI scrutiny, explaining that instead of fighting the allegations, he hopes Pocketpair's position and overall work ethic prove that the developers aren't down with AI in the slightest.</p><p>"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," he said. "That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."</p><p>Pocketpair is currently in the middle of a tense lawsuit with Nintendo over Palworld, with the latest in the litigation being that the Pokemon maker believes mods don't constitute "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">prior art</a>." This motion essentially invalidates Palworld as a mere copycat of Pokemon, not something wholly original like Pocketpair argues.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced that there will be a free update for Pikmin 4, coming in November, and it has released a trailer to confirm what will be present. The main takeaways are a photo mode, Decor Pikmin, and new difficulty levels. In addition, the Pikmin 4 demo will be updated on the same day on the main game’s update release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pikmin 4 – Update Overview – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pikmin 4’s photo mode, you can take pictures anywhere using the Field Camera. This will let you capture moments from the game, and customise those photos with frames and stickers. The world of Pikmin 4 will also see the introduction of Decor Pikmin, which are Pikmin with unique features hiddent around the world. There will be clues present to find them, and when you do you can export them to Pikmin Bloom. Finally, the two new difficulty levels are Relaxed and Fierce. In Relaxed mode, creatures will not attack you unless you attack them first. They will also be easier to defeat compared to normal mode. Lethal mode is for players who want more of a challenge from Pikmin 4, with creatures being more aggressive and harder to take down.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/19/pikmin-4-review/">Pikmin 4 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Pikmin 4 review, Stefan wrote, <em>“There’s a pleasing mixture of the familiar and the new within Pikmin 4. The fresh camera view and tweaks to the gameplay make it feel more accessible, but for returning players, the focus on the Dandori ethos of planning, efficiency and adaptability provides new arenas to test your skills. Oh, and Oatchi’s a real cutie too.”</em></p>

<p>Both versions!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Nintendo followed up on its recently 'Close to You' short with another version that confirmed the presence of <strong>Pikmin</strong>, the company annoyingly kept it locked to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Well, not anymore, because both versions of the film – Pikmin and invisible Pikmin – have been uploaded to YouTube in one 8-minute-long video. Nice!</p>
<p>In case you happened to miss the whole thing, Close to You was uploaded with no warning and depicted a young child happily playing about with objects that seemed to be moving on their own. With some familiar background music, however, many had deduced that this simply <em>must</em> be Pikmin-related in some way.</p>
<p>Turns out it was! The video was uploaded to Nintendo Today!, but updated to show that the moving objects were actually being manipulated by lots and lots of Pikmin.</p>
<p>Many (including us) had hoped that this might be some indication of something more from the Pikmin franchise, but it was subsequently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sorry-nintendos-recent-pikmin-videos-arent-hinting-at-something-more">confirmed to be the first project from Nintendo Pictures</a>, the video production team previously known as Dynamo Pictures. The same company had also produced several Pikmin shorts back in the mid 2010s.</p>
<p>Having said that, Nintendo has just recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> will be receiving a free content update on Switch, adding in new Pikmin designs, a photo mode, and more. Pretty cool, huh? So we guess it wasn't all for show then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft RedLynx, the Finland-based Ubisoft team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-rising/">Trials Rising</a> that also largely operates as a support studio for Ubisoft projects, who recently helped Massive Entertainment bring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars: Outlaws to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, is expected to layoff 60 developers from its team in Helsinki as the studio shifts to specializing in "<em>small screens</em>."</p>



<p>A statement <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/">posted on the Ubisoft RedLynx website</a> sticks to the corporate standard by not calling the cuts 'layoffs' but instead "<em>a restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company's global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company's worldwide studio network.</em>"</p>



<p>The final decision on the layoffs will be made after negotiations with the production and administration teams, who are most impacted by the proposed cuts. The RedLynx developers working on the Snowdrop Engine do not seem to be impacted by these proposed layoffs.</p>



<p>These cuts aren't just part of an effort to cut costs, as they are also part of RedLynx being reshaped from its current multiplatform focus to becoming a studio that specializes in "<em>small screens</em>," which surely means mobile devices, but also probably means the Nintendo Switch 2 and optimizing for PC handhelds, particularly after RedLynx's efforts to bring Star Wars: Outlaws to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>If implemented, the proposed changes would refocus Ubisoft RedLynx from a multiplatform setup to a studio specialized in small screens,</em>" the statement reads. "<em>This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio's unique expertise, starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading</em>."</p>



<p>RedLynx began its life as an independent studio in 2000, with a focus on smaller mobile and browser titles. Its Trials series is what the studio is known for, and part of what led Ubisoft to acquire the studio in 2011.</p>
