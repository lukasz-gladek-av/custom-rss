                <p>The battle royale genre dominated 2017. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, PUBG, Apex Legends, and other games came out around that time and took over the gaming zeitgeist. We're almost a decade out from the golden age of battle royales and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes it is the best shooter genre out there.</p><p>"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," Sweeney said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Battle royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented -- and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p>

<p>Sweeney also spoke about the fact that people still view Fortnite as just a battle royale and not an "everything game." Epic Games considers Fortnite a platform that includes creator-made modes as well as developer-created modes like Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing. Battle royale, including it's multiple spin-offs like Zero Build, is still the game's most popular mode.</p><p>"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><p>While Fortnite does include a number of other game types and genres, none have come close to the popularity level that battle royale has reached. In other Fortnite news, the game's Unreal Editor will soon get brick-by-brick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-is-getting-lego-brick-by-brick-building/1100-6532057/" data-ref-id="1100-6532057">Lego building.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/out-of-nowhere-arcsystem-works-sends-the-fighting-game-genre-into-chaos-as-the-outlook-suddenly-changes-for-riots-2xko<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>During last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play</a>, the show concluded with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. A superhero tag-team fighter from Arc System Works, the community of die-hard fighting game lovers celebrated the announcement, with some making comparisons to Riot Games' upcoming release: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a></p>
<p>2XKO, itself a tag fighter that has been in development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment">since Radiant Entertainment was acquired by Riot back in 2016</a> had largely had the tag-fighter space to itself for the foreseeable future, with the exception of the endearing but budget title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a>.</p>
<p>However, with this announcement, it looks like Riot Games has a real Marvel rival to contend with. Social media was abuzz with excitement for Marvel Tokon. Justin Wong, perhaps North America's most prominent Marvel vs Capcom player, <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930380603524034820">wrote</a>: "Holy shit MARVEL FIGHTING GAME IS BACK?!".</p>

<p>Yipes, himself a beloved figure in the professional fighting game scene and a legendary Marvel vs Capcom 2 player, was lost for words. <a href="https://x.com/IFCYipeS/status/1930382431057784971">He posted</a>, "!??!?!?!??!?!?!", an apt measure of the overall feeling following the State of Play.</p>
<p>This reveal brought with it immediate comparisons to 2XKO, due to the unavoidable rivalry between the two games. <a href="https://x.com/Alioune85/status/1930405418137727416">Former pro player Alioune</a> summed it up with "If « fuck you 2xko » was a game", whereas <a href="https://x.com/Nushinator24/status/1930382031797792861">one fighting game fan</a> on Twitter reacted by stating: "Game already has a bigger roster than 2xko".</p>
<p>Indeed in the run up to 2XKO's release later this year the game has been seen through a more critical lens following recent announcements and play tests. Game director on 2XKO Shaun Rivera revealed in a Discord Q&amp;A earlier this year that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why">2XKO will have 10 champions at launch</a>, a relatively small number for a tag fighter. That game currently has seven announced fighters, whereas Marvel Hokon blasted out the gate with eight on display.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can’t wait to play it.</p>— Shaun Rivera (@Unconkable) <a href="https://twitter.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However rather gritting their teeth or keeping thoughts close to their chest, several members of the 2XKO development team praised the new game. Unsurprising, as the team is composed of several former professional fighting game players. Rivera<a href="https://x.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550"> congratulated the Marvel Hokon team on the reveal</a>: "Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can't wait to play it."</p>
<p>Ben Forbes, 2XKO's editor-in-chief, <a href="https://x.com/draggles/status/1930380440315277393">shot out an initial</a> "oh fuck", before following up with: "sorry i was in meetings and had to pay attention MARVELLLLLLLLLLLLLL I'M THERE DAY ONE IRON MAN LOOKS SO SICK AAAAAAAAAA also star lord is dante???? LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO".</p>
<p>All in all it appears to be a "two cakes" situation, with two somewhat similar games clashing in the future resulting in more options for those who love diving deep into 2D brawls. <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930392702568317181">As Wong puts it</a>: "Too many fighting games what a time to be a fighting game fan".</p>
<p>If there are any companies catching strays right now, it's actually Capcom. The developer responsible for the Marvel vs Capcom series up until the poorly received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite</a>. Folks reacted to Marvel taking the IP to another company with the sort of humour you'd imagine. Take Evo champion Sonicfox, who posted the following image:</p>

<p>Ultimately Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls has made the next year or so dead interesting. Whether Riot Games can capture the hearts and minds with a live service approach, or Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls can cut itself a slice of the pie with some of its own boundary-pushing twists on the genre, is something the two will have to fight over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft also confirmed seven games that will be leaving Xbox Game Pass this month on June 15, 2025. Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dordogne - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Isonzo - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Keplerth - PC</li>
<li>My Time at Sandrock - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Depersonalization - PC</li>
</ul>
<p>With Xbox's big summer showcase event in just a few days from the time of this writing, this first batch of 10 games joining Game Pass this month might not be the only ones that'll hit the service in June. As Xbox has proven before, it's not adverse to doing a shadow-drop, with games capping off their trailers with a very welcomed 'available on Game Pass now' message. We'll have to see what Sunday holds.</p>

Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.”<br></p><p>While that’s not confirmation of local splitscreen, it did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some the impression</a></span> that free roam would be a multiplayer-friendly mode. But it turns out that’s not really the case. There are essentially two versions of Free Roam. One is single-player and includes all of the challenges and collectibles. The other is a glorified online lobby where you drive around in-between matches but there’s not really anything to do. And neither lets you play with another person sitting next to you.</p><p>Now, F<em>orza Horizon 5 </em>doesn’t support local co-op either. Rendering an open world is very resource intensive, and duplicating that for a second player in a second screen on the same system even more so. There are probably very valid technical and logistical hurdles that explain why Free Roam doesn’t have local splitscreen co-op. Is it still a bummer? Definitely. </p><p>As <em>Remap</em> co-host Patrick Klepek alluded to on X, the limitation will be especially galling for families who want to play together, or for parents with kids who struggle with taking turns. My own children, at least, love undirected play in video games. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are the games they spent the most time with for that exact reason. Free Roam was by far the thing that they were most intrigued with when it came to <em>Mario Kart World</em>. They like racing but they’ve done it before (and have trouble with losing). </p><p>Free Roam, with its undirected and uncompetitive gameplay, looked poised to answer both of those needs, making <em>Mario Kart World </em>something they’d love messing around in just for fun. Unfortunately, when it comes to multiplayer at least, the meat of the $80 sequel is still very much in traditional racing modes, just with some new open-world twists. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's backward compatibility feature is looking more interesting than expected before launch, as it manages to fix the massive performance issues of Batman Arkham Knight, one of the worst ports released for its predecessor.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2-back-compat-fixes-batman-arkham-knight-switch-1s-worst-triple-a-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the new-generation system from Nintendo, which has launched worldwide today, runs the horrible port of the third main entry in the series developed by Rocksteady without the massive performance issues it has on the original system. As such, the translation layer that is being used on the new system to run the original code has proven to be effective, allowing the game to put the better specs of the Switch 2 to good use. Ultimately, there's no fixing for the compromises the port's developer had to make in terms of texture quality and lack of antialiasing, and there are still some stability issues, but the fact that the Switch 2 can brute force better performance in backward-compatible titles is quite promising.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid game, Batman Arkham Knight has been somewhat infamous since its release due to the horrible state it launched in on PC, which required multiple patches to fix. The late Nintendo Switch port of the game, which launched last year, is equally infamous for being absolutely terrible, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">running at a whopping 0 FPS in certain scenarios.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally launched worldwide, but not everyone is having a good release day. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-here-and-for-some-players-their-consoles-are-already-damaged-thanks-to-stores-stapling-holes-into-the-switch-2-screen/">earlier today</a>, some early adopters found their unit's screen damaged because store employees stapled their receipts in front of the console's box.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have revealed the new gear that'll be arriving in the game with its next warbond on June 12, and there's an armour set that seems inspired by another franchise high on authoritarian satire, Judge Dredd.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm surprised it's taken that long for one of the warbonds - which as plenty of people have pointed out often amount to giving players a way to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldiver-2s-next-warbond-will-let-you-look-even-more-fascist-than-normal-adds-in-a-literal-sword">look even more fascisty</a> than you do by default in Helldivers 2 - to dip into something Dredd-ish.</p>

<p>As you can see towards the end of the trailer above, this armour set  - dubbed the BP-77 Grand Juror - will become purchasable from the game's superstore once this latest warbond goes live. There's a cape, pistol and player card to go with it, if you want to complete the look.</p>
<p>It's interesting, if understandable given how many HD2 players have been clamouring to dress up like Dredd, that Arrowhead's opted to sell this set separately to the similarly-themed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/05/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-launches-june-12/?sf277523410=1">Force of Law warbond</a> it's dropping the same day. Both are about looking like a militarised cop (or a regular cop, given the times we live in), after all.</p>
<p>As it stands, if you spend your Super Credits on the warbond, you'll get the usual little collection of fresh stuff all in one bundle. There are two armours - the medium BP-20 Correct Officer set and light BP-32 Jackboot set, the former of which looks to have drawn some visual cues from Robocop with the shape of its helmet's visor, potentially ticking yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">beloved satire box</a>.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there's the AR-32 Pacifier assault rifle and G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which sticks to enemies and downs them with electrical pulses. There's also the AX/ARC-3 'Guard Dog' K-9 stratagem, which is basically a gun taped to a drone that follows you around and makes sure an enemy doesn't lay down the law on your backside while you're distracted by some Super doughnuts.</p>
<p>As some of the folks on Reddit who're trying infer an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ko4aag/my_take_on_the_recent_warbonds_are_telling_a/">extra bit of story</a> from Arrowhead's warbond deployment have pointed out, it's arguably a bit weird to get military police gear just as the Galactic War's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">moved away from Super Earth's streets</a>.

The idea of getting a new game in the franchise, even after the woefully irrelevant <em>Thief </em>(2014), is thrilling. But god, no, not as some VR gimmick. But no, I’m not going to wallow! Instead, I’m going to take this opportunity to celebrate what we already have, and what we can still enjoy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Look, I’ll be honest.

Covering the embarrassing awfulness of Embracer Group’s handling of every property it mindlessly snaffled up, and indeed the mediocrity of 2014's peculiarly missing-the-point Eidos-Montreal-made entry, Fraser articulates why this is the opposite of what anyone should want to do with the franchise. So kudos there, and go give it a read. Although I will repeat the vital point here: sure, <em>Half-Life Alyx </em>and <em>Superhot VR</em> are great, and maybe by some miracle <em>Thief VR</em> will be the third game worth owning the tech for, but if you don’t own a PSVR2 hat, then this is a game that’s going to cost you $400+ minimum!</p><p>(And can I make clear, this is no qualitative judgement on <em>Thief VR</em> which I obviously haven’t played, nor is it one on the no doubt enormously talented, incredibly hard-working people who are making this game. I wish them the very best. I also wish they’d been given the chance to make a full <em>Thief</em> game that everyone could play.)</p><p>But we’re here to be optimistic! Yes, it’s horrendous that the rights to one of gaming’s greatest franchises—the games that began the stealth genre, and indeed inspired everything from <em>Deus Ex</em> to <em>Hitman </em>to <em>Dishonored</em>—are in the hands of a management so inept that the only ambition they have for it is to waste it on a VR game that only a handful of people will play. But that doesn’t make the original games disappear. They’re still with us. And they’re still utterly amazing.</p><p><em>Thief </em>is about a guy named Garrett. Growing up as a homeless orphan, Garrett is now a master thief, living in The City, set in a fantasy version of the Middle Ages; part steampunk, part wizardry. There are three factions: The Keepers, the Pagans and the Hammerites, with Garrett assigned to none, and willing to steal from all. The games see Garrett reluctantly get involved in the complex storylines betwixt the trio of groups vying for power, doing his best to have nothing to do with any of them, but profiting from the mayhem.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-recommend-id="image://1b475501d576679a2f33034b24f16a61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The box art for the first Thief game, with Garrett holding his bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>1998's <em>Thief: The Dark Project</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is an astonishing creation</a></span>. You might think, being 27 years old, that it has long since stopped being playable, but I’m delighted to tell you that you’re wrong. Thanks to the wonderful work of modders, the definitive version of the original game—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/211600/Thief_Gold/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211600/Thief_Gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Thief Gold</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>(which, by the way, is 97c on Steam at the time of writing)—plays in glorious widescreen and works on modern machines with projects like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewDark</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/forum/thief_series/legacy_olddark_patches_for_thief_1_2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/forum/thief_series/legacy_olddark_patches_for_thief_1_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OldDark</a></span>. As with any classic game, it’s always worth checking the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCGamingWiki page</a></span> for all the best patches and improvements before starting to play.</p><p>That done, believe me, the incredibly dated graphics matter for about 13 seconds. Heck, <em>Thief</em>’s graphics were criticized for being dated when it was released in ‘98, and it didn’t matter then any more than it does now. Because <em>Thief</em> is a game about atmosphere, and by “atmosphere” I mean “darkness,” and it has that by the metric ton. Seriously, the textures on the walls in the Hammerite temples matter very little when the first thing you do on entering any room or corridor is snuff out all the torches. Light is your enemy, shadows your only safety, and you’ll immediately embrace the darkness.</p><p>It’s incredible how quickly this draws you in, how soon you’re entirely in the role, scooping up every piece of loot as you nip from corner to corner, bonking an enemy on the back of the head to slip through to a passageway. It’s totally absorbing, and absolutely compelling.</p><p>But what I think makes <em>Thief</em> such a stand-out game almost 30 years later is a philosophy that far too few games have had the courage to try: this is a game where the higher you make the difficulty, the fewer people you’re allowed to kill. Garrett absolutely <em>can </em>murder in these games, and should you choose to, you can go through a level killing each and every guard you encounter. But turn up the difficulty, and rather than the enemies getting stronger or more difficult to kill, you’re not allowed to hurt them at all! That’s revolutionary! It’s still revolutionary 27 years on. Instead of demanding better twitch reflexes or greater amounts of durability, the harder the game, the better you had to be at being a thief.</p><p><em>Thief II: The Metal Age</em> is very similar game, but in the best possible way. It’s more! It’s more of one of the best games ever! Where the first <em>Thief</em> rather over-relied on the presence of zombies (it was as if developers Looking Glass didn’t quite dare not to include a traditional gaming enemy), here there are fewer monsters and instead more humans to avoid, set in larger, more sprawling levels with astonishing variety in how you can approach a challenge. It was, I would argue, the emergence of the immersive sim.</p><p><em>Thief II</em> came out in 2000, when I was at university, and one of my most profound memories of the game took place outside of it. I had been playing it a great deal, just delighted to be back in The City, loving every second. On this particular evening, I was going to see a friend, and so I walked into town. As I went down the street, I found myself walking only in shadows, looking ahead to see where streetlights were shining, and calculating a path that would avoid them as best as possible. It was a concerningly long time before I realized what I was doing. (Another real-world symptom was starting to view the world by the potential of its rooftops, looking out windows to plan paths where I could get between buildings, before remembering that I probably ought not.)</p><figure id="" data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-recommend-id="image://a1a33b78784bd93190334ec4da26272a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Garrett crouched with a dagger from the Thief 3 box art." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>2004's <em>Thief: The Dark Shadows</em> was, on its release, embroiled in some woefully unnecessary complaining. At this point, with the voice of the internet becoming an unavoidable thing, people were determined to find everything they could to be pre-emptively cross about. Looking Glass Studios, the legendary development studio that gave us <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Thief</em>, had tragically come to an end in 2000. Ion Storm Austin may have given us the extraordinary <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2000, but they’d also given us follow-up <em>Deus Ex: Invisible War</em> just a year before <em>Thief III</em>, a game that had unquestionably been restricted in scope by 2003's need to co-develop for the fledgling Xbox. (It remains massively underrated, but it also undeniably didn’t match its predecessor due to the wild constraints and tiny levels imposed by the weakness of the Xbox as a machine.) So people were ready to absolutely unload on <em>Deadly Shadows</em>.</p><p>Yes, the levels were smaller than in <em>Thief II</em>. Yes—and dear god, it’s incredible to remember just how much stupid asinine fuss was made about this some two decades on—the loot did glint. But <em>oh my goodness</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thief-deadly-shadows-will-still-have-you-fearing-the-light-some-16-years-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is an extraordinarily good game</a></span>. <em>Deadly Shadows</em> may not have had the acres-wide playing areas, but instead it sported some of the finest level design in all of gaming, boosted by stunning storytelling, and one of the most memorable levels ever created in any game ever, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/making-of-thief-deadly-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cradle</a></span>. It was, and is, one of the most all-consuming games you’ll ever play, where you’ll lose yourself into the character you’re playing like nothing else, fearing all forms of light for weeks after you play.</p><p>So yes, it sucks beyond all belief that Embracer has the rights to this greatest of series. The company could be offering established indie teams the opportunity to craft a new <em>Thief</em> game in the spirit of the original three, or even trying to get the band back together and offering Looking Glass/Ion Storm alumni the chance. It could be doing so much, and instead its decision is to make a VR game that’s already buried under the logo of the unloved 2014 game that had so little to do with the games before it, for a format that most people are long over.</p><p>But it cannot take away what we already have, and that is something to be treasured. And right this moment, by sheer lovely coincidence, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/1459/Thief_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get all three games for less than a dollar each!</a></span> That’s <em>incredible</em>! (You can even get the daft, goth-ridden, watched-<em>The-Crow</em>-too-much-as-a-kid 2014 <em>Thief </em>for $3.)</p><p>And you should. You’ll be so glad you did.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-requires-pricey-extra-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-to-fully-complete<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Welcome Tour arrives today alongside the launch of Nintendo's new console, though it cannot be fully completed without also purchasing extra accessories - and a 4K TV.</p>
<p>The minigame collection has already drawn criticism for not being a pack-in game, considering it is designed to show off the capabilities of the Switch 2. Instead, it'll set you back eight quid. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime waded in</a> on the debate.</p>
<p>Yet as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/products/soft.html#other">Nintendo has stated on its website</a> (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-to-require-a-few-accessories-for-100-completion/">Nintendo Soup</a>), some of the 34 minigames and tech demos require peripherals which are sold separately.</p>

<p>One minigame requires a USB camera; another requires the GL/GR buttons on the Switch 2 Pro Controller (although they're also on the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip with the console); and a 4K TV is required for both a minigame and a tech demo to experience the proper resolution.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that all 12 areas of the game can still be accessed without these accessories, but to 100 percent the game you'll need three medals in every minigame.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back £74.99, an extra Charging Grip costs £29.99, while the Switch 2 Camera costs £58.99 - although a cute Piranha Plant alternative is £34.99 if you don't mind a poor resolution.</p>
<p>As for a 4K TV, that could cost you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Over in the US, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo even raised the price of its accessories to combat US tariffs</a> on the console itself.</p>
<p>"From my slightly extended but still brief time with it, it feels like Nintendo has created, if not the most wildly entertaining, at least the most spiritually accurate take on visiting an actual museum dedicated to a games console," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell on Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>"You read a bit, you play around a bit, you go, 'huh,' and have a little ruminate on what you've learned, and move on. If it weren't for all the Joy-Con waggling I'd ideally play this thing with my arms clasped behind my back, head slightly cocked to one side, assuming the official position of the museum attendee."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Bertie has already had some time with The Alters. "It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p>
<p>As for Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, our Chris called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles" following his time with the game earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>.</p> <div>

			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch day, a day that's supposed to be exciting for players and developers alike, with a new Nintendo console in the market and hopefully, plenty of new experiences on the horizon.</p>
<p>Some players though, are definitely getting the kind of 'new experience' with their Switch 2 they didn't ask for, and that's the experience of their brand-new console already being broken, before they even opened the box.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">IGN</a>, some players who went to retail GameStop locations to pick up their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles through midnight launches got home to discover that there were <a href="https://x.com/Rudeboy__NYC/status/1930568461014499667">holes in the console's screen</a>, from <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">store employees stapling their receipts to the front of the Nintendo Switch 2 box</a>.</p>
<p>This happened to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/comment/mw370bi/">number of players</a> who went to the same GameStop in Staten Island, where it seems everyone who was at that location walked away with their receipt stapled to the front of the Switch 2 box.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigr7gwt2ltcl3r7pyx4vblqsbjeofoz3uiszpux2kk5xsfizqyzlu">
<p lang="en">Apparently one GameStop store used a stapler to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes and the staple ruined the screen...another person commented their unit and others were affected at the same store www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/c...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed">Wario64 (@wario64.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed">2025-06-05T07:18:39.993Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately for everyone who went to that same GameStop, they will probably have to wait until that store gets its next shipment of Switch 2 consoles, to get their replacements. Though, the reaction online hasn't been all negative towards GameStop alone. Many players on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davefpg.bsky.social/post/3lqua356xqk23">social media</a> have also noted that Nintendo should've packaged the console better, and not have the screen facing up at the top of the box.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if Nintendo repackages the Switch 2 in response to these issues, or if any more reports of retail employees puncturing holes in the screen crop up. Plenty of stores across the globe had midnight launches, including the newly-separated, Canadian-owned <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-canada-has-been-sold-and-acquired-by-mcfarlane-toys-co-owner-stephen-tretrault-will-re-launch-as-eb-games-canada/">EB Games</a>, and more reports of this happening at other stores have yet to be spotted. For now, it looks like this lone Staten Island store is the 'what not to do' example for everyone else.</p>

			<p>Funcom's survival multiplayer sandbox game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a> launches today for those who have purchased the Deluxe and Ultimate editions and it features NVIDIA DLSS 4 support for maximum performance.</p>
<p>The game includes support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (available on all RTX GPUs), Frame Generation (available on RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs), and Multi Frame Generation (available on RTX 50 Series GPUs). According to NVIDIA, performance in Dune Awakening can be enhanced by an average of 4.9X at 4K resolution and max settings while activating all the above with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode. The official benchmarks show the RTX 5090 surpassing 338 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 averages 270 FPS, the RTX 5070 Ti 239 FPS, and the RTX 5070 198 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Optionally, users can turn on the NVIDIA app override to improve DLSS quality in the game with the new transformer model. Lastly, Dune Awakening also supports NVIDIA Reflex, which NVIDIA says can reduce system latency by up to 50% in this title. As a reminder, if your PC simply isn't strong enough to run Dune Awakening, you can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-dune-awakening-fbc-firebreak-mindseye-and-rematch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play it via GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, Codemasters launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports F1 25</a>, this year's edition of the licensed Formula One racing game. This title actually supports the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite. On top of the aforementioned DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, the game also includes Ray Reconstruction, which can be enabled to replace the built-in denoiser to greatly enhance the quality of the ray tracing/<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">path tracing</a>. NVIDIA says that enabling all DLSS technologies can multiply performance in F1 25 by an average of 7.9X at 4K with Ultra High settings and path tracing during a race around a wet Bahrain at night with 20 cars. The RTX 5090 breaks 372 frames per second, the RTX 5080 averages 246 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 206 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Lastly, NVIDIA confirmed that the GeForce Summer of RTX promotion <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/contests/summer-of-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is returning</a>. They encouraged users to follow GeForce and GeForce NOW accounts on social media to stay up to date on prize bundles featuring GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, GeForce RTX gaming PCs from Falcon Northwest, Maingear, and ORIGIN, and even more prizes coming later this season. Also, they are kicking off a new promotion titled RTX Watch &amp; Win: when new trailers drop during the biggest shows like the upcoming Summer Game Fest, participants have a chance to win Steam gift cards via NVIDIA's social pages.</p>

The pictures showed the receipt stapled to the front of the box, the puncture holes it left in both the cardboard and the plastic wrap, and the ensuing dents in the Switch 2's screen. </p><p>The GameStop in question was reportedly located in Staten Island, New York. Like at most of the company’s stores, the midnight launch brought out tons of Nintendo fans excited to be some of the first in the world to go hands-on with the new hardware. It’s unclear if the stapling was being done by everyone at the store or just one person, and how many people were ultimately affected. Other users who were at the event shared similar horror stories, though. </p><p>“GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box, FML,” Oadhan Lynch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span>. “Genuinely insane now I’m gonna have to wait 3 months for the restock. And yes we were there for the midnight release so I bet everyone in this line is gonna have this same issue.” Another customer from the same location who faced a similar situation commiserated with them in the comments. </p><p>While stapling anything to a video game console box is unnecessary and lowkey unhinged, anyone working a console midnight launch at GameStop is probably part-time and making barely $15 an hour, especially as store closures and high turnover have continued to hollow out more seasoned staff. For many employees across the company at thousands of locations, this was probably the first console launch they’d ever worked through. It was certainly the biggest. </p><p>Nintendo, on the other hand, has experience not just with launching new consoles but boxing and shipping hundreds of millions of them all around the world. So it should be noted that it’s equally wild that the company known for its meticulous attention to detail would box the Switch 2 with the screen facing up and only covered by 1.5cm of light cardboard. </p><p>I know because I measured. I was surprised by just how exposed the Switch 2 seemed after I unboxed mine last night. The packaging is so thin that even the box falling from a certain height onto the wrong object might be equally damaging. Others were kind of horrified, too. “You’re going to hear about a few damaged screens in the coming days,” one new Switch 2 owner <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AncientArgonaut/status/1930552016545390644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AncientArgonaut/status/1930552016545390644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted on X</a></span>. “They are at risk just being stacked in shipping.”</p><p>Maybe not. Maybe Nintendo actually did testing on the box layout and found that, for structural reasons not obvious to the naked eye, the Switch 2 remains safe from just about anything that might normally happen to it during transit, except, clearly, someone taking a stapler to it. The consoles can be replaced but the wait will be a pain for those who thought they’d finally gotten their hands on a console that would last them for another eight years. “Totally killed the excitement of the night,” wrote Oadhan Lynch.</p><p> It’s worth noting that at least some Switch 2 consoles ordered directly from Nintendo came packaged in a second, much sturdier outer box, as contributing editor John Walker discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ht7hc64fzee5fhoo456t3t2v/post/3lqu4kjeq7s2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ht7hc64fzee5fhoo456t3t2v/post/3lqu4kjeq7s2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when his arrived earlier today</a></span>. GameStop and Nintendo did not immediately respond to request for comment. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Next month marks the 43rd anniversary of the original Tron movie, but players won't have to wait any longer to reenter the Grid. Ahead of its full release later this month, the demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tron-catalysts-shift-to-isometric-action-feels-like-a-nice-change-in-perspective/1100-6531077/" data-ref-id="1100-6531077" data-mce-href="/articles/tron-catalysts-shift-to-isometric-action-feels-like-a-nice-change-in-perspective/1100-6531077/">Tron: Catalyst</a> has debuted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>According to Tron: Catalyst director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lqpkd2zztc2l" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lqpkd2zztc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mike Bithell</a>, the demo covers roughly the first hour of the game. Bithell also noted that the game supports ultrawide monitors, which he felt was appropriate for the franchise.</p><p>Catalyst is a departure from Bithell Games' previous title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/" data-ref-id="1900-6418054" data-mce-href="/reviews/tron-identity-review-gone-in-60-millicycles/1900-6418054/">Tron: Identity</a>. That game was essentially an interactive cyberpunk novel, while Tron: Catalyst has switched genres to isometric action. Players will be able to utilize their Identity Discs and their Light Cycles while facing The Core, a militant faction that's holding on to power in the Arq Grid.</p><p>It's unclear if Tron himself will make any kind of appearance in the game, as players will be stepping into the role of a new hero named Exo. She's taken it upon herself to carry on Tron's legacy by protecting the Grid and doing everything she can to bring down The Core. Exo can face her enemies with melee moves, but her most versatile weapon remains her disc, which can be used for both offense and defense.</p><p>Tron: Catalyst will launch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on June 17. But it won't be the only Tron media coming this year. The next feature film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-reveals-first-tron-ares-footage-at-d23/1100-6525696/" data-ref-id="1100-6525696" data-mce-href="/articles/disney-reveals-first-tron-ares-footage-at-d23/1100-6525696/">Tron: Ares</a>, will hit theaters on October 10. Last year, the star of that film, Jared Leto, shared his experience at Walt Disney World where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-tron-ares-star-jared-leto-ride-tron-lightcycle-at-disney-world/1100-6526123/" data-ref-id="1100-6526123" data-mce-href="/articles/watch-tron-ares-star-jared-leto-ride-tron-lightcycle-at-disney-world/1100-6526123/">he rode the Tron: Lightcycle ride</a> for the first time.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's multiplayer shooter XDefiant has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-xdefiant-is-officially-shut-down/1100-6532087/" data-ref-id="1100-6532087">officially closed down</a>, and now game director Mark Rubin has announced he's leaving the games industry overall. He also discussed what he believes went wrong with the game, including claiming that Ubisoft gave the game "little to no marketing" and that Ubisoft didn't give the team enough resources to help it succeed after launch.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" rel="nofollow ">post on social media</a>, Rubin said, "It's a sad day for fans of XDefiant and for all the passionate devs that worked so hard on this game." He said he thanks fans for playing and promoting it. "Every voice mattered," he said.</p><p>"I would say something remarkable happened with this game in that although we had very little marketing, we still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title just from you guys all talking about and promoting the game," Rubin said.</p><p>He's likely referring to how XDefiant was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d2mt2e/8_million_people_played_xdefiant/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported to have reached 8 million players in its first week</a>. That momentum was not sustained, and Rubin blamed this in part on Ubisoft providing "little to no marketing" support, especially after launch.</p><p>Some may question this claim, as Ubisoft regularly promoted XDefiant before and after launch, and the game featured characters based on Ubisoft's biggest franchises, including Far Cry, The Division, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed, and Watch Dogs. On YouTube, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/search?query=xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published more than two-dozen XDefiant videos</a> aimed at hyping the game. The game's social media pages had <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of thousands of followers</a> that received all the newest details as they were announced.</p><p>However, Rubin said XDefiant failed to acquire new users after its big launch, and contributed to the game's downfall.</p><p>Other issues that XDefiant faced included "crippling tech debt" in the form of the XDefiant developers "using an engine that wasn't designed for what we were doing, and we didn't have the engineering resources to ever correct that."</p><p>Rubin went on to question whether or not proprietary game engines make sense anymore. "This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he said. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn't handle it and you would have a bad experience."</p><p>The developer added that his team also struggled to have "the right resources to make content for the game." He said Seasons 4 and 5 would have "completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch," but the team did not have the resources to deliver it.</p><p>He said XDefiant's developers and Ubisoft leadership had their hearts "in the right place," but the game struggled because, "We just didn't have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p>Some may also wonder about external factors that could have contributed to XDefiant's inability to sustain and grow its audience. It's been reported that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/10-live-service-games-made-up-more-than-40-of-last-months-us-playtime-on-playstation-and-xbox/1100-6529723/" data-ref-id="1100-6529723">huge percentage of total play time in multiplayer games is dominated by only a few titles</a>, making it challenging for new games to break through.</p><p>XDefiant's development team was laid off in 2024, including Rubin, and he's now leaving the gaming industry overall to spend time with his family.</p><p>"So unfortunately you won't be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say," he said.</p><p>Rubin rose to fame in the gaming industry for his work on the Call of Duty series. He was a producer on the hugely popular 2007 game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, before producing its sequels as well. He left Infinity Ward after Call of Duty: Ghosts came out in 2013.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-brings-great-justice-next-week.1208253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead and Sony have revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's packed with new gear and emotes to make your next battle for Super Earth all the more stylish.</p>

<p>Following on from last month's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony</a> and March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a>, the Force of Law Warbond will launch on June 12th. It'll bring new weapons, armor, and patterns, as well as new emotes to communicate with your squad.</p>

<p>Your first new weapon is the AR-32 Pacifier, a high-capacity assault rifle that promises to be an excellent crowd-clearing machine. It's joined by the G-109 Urchin stun grenade, which can attach to enemies and dispense periodic electrical pulses to knock them out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-g-109.jpg?itok=zVCe863d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond-g-109.jpg?itok=W4Sv07k- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is here, and it's got an explosive new surprise for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Also being added to the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>arsenal in the Force of Law Warbond is a new Guard Dog drone, the AX/ARC-3 K-9, which dispenses electric arc shots. Like other Guard Dog weapons, it's capable of friendly fire, so don't stand in its way.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new support weapon in the form of the GL-52 De-Escalator, an appropriately-named grenade launcher that fires arc grenades. You can probably sense a theme emerging here, right?</p>

<p>As with previous&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds, new armor will also be added in Force of Law. The BP-20 Correct Officer medium set has "protective padding and roomy pouches", while the BP-32 Jackboot set is a lighter outfit with "an official-looking tailored jacket and sturdy pauldrons".</p>

<p>Both sets will grant you the Ballistic Padding passive, which will reduce chest damage, as well as explosive and bleed damage. No longer will you suddenly bleed out without realizing exactly how you've died (guilty as charged!).</p>




<p>This Warbond comes just a couple of weeks after two major&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>updates; the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization" rel="nofollow">introduced new enemies</a> and weapon customization systems, while the second <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update" rel="nofollow">sent you and your squad to Super Earth</a> to defend it from the Illuminate faction.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The Force of Law Warbond launches on June 12th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/680294/switch-2-gamestop-launch-event-nintendo-america-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m standing outside the GameStop at Union Square in New York City on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon, with plenty of cars rolling by and people basking in the late spring sun. On the corner of E 14th Street and University Place, a line has formed around the block.</p><p>Tonight is the official launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, a console people have been waiting for years to arrive. Some publications and influencers received theirs one day early, but for the rest of the world, tonight is the first opportunity to play it. And for a lot of the people in this line, that means they’re willing to wait a little longer.</p><p>By 7PM I’ve talked to plenty of people queued up, and the overwhelming sentiment is that everyone is excited for <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left, Andrea. Right, Kyle.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>“It’s been forever since the last one,” Kyle and Andrea tell me. “It only makes sense to get it now. Might as well.”</p><p>The last version, <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, first launched in 2014 for the Wii U, eventually becoming <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> when it launched on the Nintendo Switch. <em>Mario Kart World</em> is the first truly new console edition in a decade, and fans are eager to start playing.</p><p>Chris has been waiting in line for about four hours and brought his own chair. He tells me that his friends have been working all day, so he’s trying to hold them a spot.</p><p>“These are crazy hard to get. I don’t have a lot to do today, so I’m gonna see if I can save a spot in line for them.”</p><p>Finally, I find one fan who tells me he’s excited for the Switch 2 because of its power. “I had the Switch and then the Switch OLED, and I’m honestly pretty stoked to run this thing at 4k 60fps. It’s a huge jump,” Anthony tells me.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Anthony (left) and his girlfriend, Mary (right)</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>Inside the store, staff has been working since 11AM, pre-processing customers to make tonight’s launch go smoothly. They take four people at a time from the line outside, check them out with consoles and accessories, and hand them a ticket with a number to come back and claim later. There are still a few hours to go, so most people are walking down the street to grab dinner or drinks.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A body painter (left) paints a customer’s arm (right).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To tide over patient customers, GameStop has set up various stations. There’s a body painter giving people Nintendo-themed paint-jobs, a <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> set up, and, of course, <em>Mario Kart</em>. Kids flank the stations while their parents check out, and the store even lined up a DJ to keep people entertained.</p><p>GameStop has completely outfitted the store with <em>Mario</em>-themed ornaments. There are full-sized cardboard cutouts of various characters spread throughout, and a map of <em>Mario Kart World</em> embedded into the floor. It’s clear the retailer knew this would be a massive launch, and it decked out the store to help fans celebrate.</p><p>Around 9PM, Doug Bowser, the CEO of Nintendo of America, makes a surprise appearance. Bowser talks to customers and recites a likely pre-scripted conversation with GameStop staff on camera which will probably appear in a LinkedIn post, then moves to the mural on the wall for a photo with employees.</p><p>I asked Bowser what he was most excited for, and he blasts off a quick speech about <em>Mario Kart</em>. It’s expected at this point — a theme of the night.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Doug Bowser (second from left) makes a surprise entrance</em>.</figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Doug Bowser (center) poses with Gamestop staff.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Doug Bowser (left) poses with a fan (right)</em></figcaption></p></div><p>People start merging back into the line at 11PM, now stretching down the block and around the corner. Earlier in the night, GameStop employees handed out raffle tickets for free games, and they start calling numbers for the winners. If you won, you were graced with a copy of <em>Splatoon 3</em>, a game not currently updated to take advantage of the Switch 2’s superior hardware.</p><p>At 11:55PM I head inside, alongside the first few customers awaiting the midnight release. Dawn is the first to receive his Switch 2 after waiting outside this GameStop since 4:17AM.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Dawn walking away with the first Switch 2 of the night.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>“I can’t really believe I’ve been waiting this long, but it was worth it.” Everyone cheers and the line starts flowing faster. Crowds of people who didn’t pre-pay for the console continue to show up and get in line. They’ll probably be here until morning.</p><p>I left the store about 30 minutes after release, wondering how many instances of anecdotal evidence it would take to make the console a success. But if this store is anything to go by, the Nintendo Switch 2 is already a hit.</p><p><em>Photography by David Imel.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The Kingdom Come kind of simulation ... there's so many options, you can change the world, it's super great," Badowski continued. "We'd like to follow this trend as well. So these are our next steps for sure, and it's kind of a similar challenge to what we have in The Witcher 3 because of the open world and storytelling here, freedom of choices. But at the same time, we would like to build very fleshy, very well-motivated characters. So it's kind of in contradiction from time to time. That's a great design challenge."</p><p>Badowski doesn't think Larian's D&amp;D blockbuster Baldur's Gate 3 has as much in common with the CDPR style. "It's turn-based so it's a different kind of game, and the way you interact with characters is totally different," Badowski explains. "Because there's freedom of choice in Larian's work, it pushes you to use different tricks than ours. But I think we observe each other, and there are not that many games like that, so ... we see how players react to those tactics."</p><p>CDPR co-CEO also expressed admiration for Baldur's Gate 3, even though it's different from what the studio wants to do with The Witcher and Cyberpunk. "We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did," Nowakowski said. "That's the kind of game they can make. But a lot of stuff with how the characters can interact with the world and what it does was for sure some inspiration to us."</p><p>CD Projekt Red just released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">gorgeous-looking new tech demo</a> for The Witcher 4 as part of State of Unreal 2025, though the actual game still seems to be a while off.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Nightreign has been widely recognized as a difficult game with bosses that can easily kill you with any number of attacks. But just as people struggled with Margot during the opening of Elden Ring, there is a near-endless amount of room for improvement. As Ishizaki says, you'll eventually succeed if you stick with it.</p><p>Richard Wakeling applauded From Software and the studio's creative approach to multiplayer in his GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">review of Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p><p>"Elden Ring Nightreign's announcement was a genuine surprise. The details explaining the kind of game it was were even more surprising," he wrote. "This peculiar mix of a From Software RPG spliced with elements of roguelites and battle royales sounds like the kind of experimental concept no game studio would actually devote money to. But here's From Software, tapping into its creativity to put its own weird, bold spin on a thrilling cooperative multiplayer experience. Even if the end result were middling, this is the kind of risk worth celebrating, but doubly so now that it turned out to be such a fantastic, anomalous <em>thing</em>. The part of From Software's collective brain that created oddities like Metal Wolf Chaos and Otogi: Myth of Demons is still very much alive and well."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-include-promised-improvements-for-solo-play/1100-6531974/" data-ref-id="1100-6531974">Nightreign's most recent patch</a> brought several changes and fixes to the difficulty of solo play in the multiplayer roguelike. The patch adds the "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat" effect that allows players to revive once per nighttime boss battle.</p>
