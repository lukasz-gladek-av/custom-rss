            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5 release date, and the turn-based gacha RPG's latest content drop officially arrives next month, bringing new characters and more with it.</p>
<p>Following on from the (roughly) monthly release cadence that saw&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-24-release-date">Version 2.4 arrive in late July</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date">Version 2.3 before it launch in mid-June</a>, Version 2.5 will arrive on September 10th across PC, PS5, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's bringing a continuation of the ongoing&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>story, and this time, you'll be uncovering "long-buried secrets within the Shackling Prison", bringing what HoYoverse calls a "trailblazing silkpunk saga" to a climax.</p>

<p>As ever, new five-star characters are also joining the fray in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.5. The first of these is Feixiao, a warrior trained in "all forms of martial arts" who can deal heavy damage with her gunblades or her axe.</p>
<p>She's joined by Lingsha, a summoner who's able to call up the incense beast Fuyuan to assist her in combat. She can deal damage, heal allies, and debuff enemies as well, so she's a valuable ally on the battlefield.</p>
<p>A new four-star character, Moze, is also making his debut in Version 2.5. This update will see reruns for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-characters-robin-and-boothill-version-21-will-be-revealed">Robin</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-honkai-star-rail-story-trailer-shows-how-deliciously-bad-kafka-can-be">Kafka</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-black-swan">Black Swan</a> in the first half of the cycle, while <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-showcases-new-fire-character-topaz-her-pet-warp-trotter">Topaz</a> will make a return in the second half.</p>

		<p><em>Recently, Rob and Patrick found themselves </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/the-old-internet-was-better/" rel="noreferrer"><em>remembering what it was like on The Old Internet</em></a><em>, a period of loud dial-up modems and sketchy but surprising ways of <s>pirating</s> discovering music. In the same way, it's never been easier to "discover" movies and television shows, but doesn't it feel overwhelming and weird, too?</em></p><p><em>This conversation was prompted </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/my-turn-o-brother-where-art-thou/" rel="noreferrer"><em>by our recent My Turn episode covering O Brother, where art thou?</em></a><em>, a movie Rob, Patrick, and Cado hadn't watched since it came out more than 20 years ago. There's plenty of movies, and plenty of reasons, to go a  long time before revisiting a film, but back in the day, the cycle was different. You had less choice of what to watch, but it also meant a world of curated entertainment by an invisible had of TV executives, or the local video store clerks.</em></p><p><em>Different doesn't mean better, but this week, we tried sitting with what we found attractive and interesting about that time, and considered ways to introduce movie spice into our lives. A little friction, so to speak.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Now that's a damn movie. Image Credit: Touchstone Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Rob, there’s a moment in the latest episode of My Turn where I ponder why it took me more than 20 years to return to <em>O Brother, where art thou?</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Part of my explanation—or theory—is that it’s not a movie where I sit down at the end of a long day and go “okay, time to watch <em>O Brother, where art thou? </em>It’s a weird, charming movie that I’m glad to have spent a few hours revisiting, but upon reflection, what I was most taken by was discovering I hadn’t rewatched it within the confines of, say, a hotel room looping Starz or because it accidentally came up while browsing cable channels a decade ago and going <em>huh</em>.</p><p>We talked about this in the context of music recently, but it’s got me thinking about movies, too. I miss the days of flipping on cable, landing on a movie I’d seen before and getting sucked into a scene, only to find another 90 minutes had gone by and I’d rewatched. Heck, if it was airing on something like TNT, there’s a good chance I watched it with commercials <em>and</em> it was edited up. I discovered new films by renting them at the store and revisited old films chopped up on cable.</p><p>The difference between movies and music is that I keep up with the newest movies. I listen to several movie podcasts with spoiler discussions that I keep in the podcast chamber until I’ve had a chance to see it myself. This combination of internal and external factors are useful motivation for seeing Alien: Romulus but less useful for revisiting O Brother, where art thou?&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite holiday is Halloween, and thus, one of my favorite traditions is coming up with a list of movies for my wife and I to watch over the course of the month. The list is important, because it serves as a guiding post and a checklist of shame for movies that we planned to see in October. (But if we’re being honest, the horror movie watching begins in earnest sometime in September, since it’ll take me nearly two months to watch more than 20 movies, anyway.)</p><p>That list ends up being a combination of films I hold dear that I want to revisit, movies with a significant historical milestone like a 30th anniversary, older movies I’ve overlooked, and new movies that are timed to drop around Halloween time. But one of the core services of the list is an opportunity—a push—to rewatch old movies! It’s my own curated cable channel of horror, in a world where I’m otherwise always looking forward and rarely find myself in situations where I’m revisiting a classic. Actually, let me amend that. Part of the reason I miss cable surfing is because it was full of <em>stuff, not</em> just <em>classics</em>. It’s easy to find reasons to rewatch a movie that holds a special place in your heart, but much harder to find reasons for, well, everything else.</p><p>Do you have a different method for revisiting older movies? Is your relationship to movies different from music, too?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hellraiser is one of the movies we rewatch every year. Image Credit: Clive Barker</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>ROB: </strong>To quote a movie I suspect we’re not actually going to watch before <em>Megalopolis</em>, “I don’t see any method at all.”</p>

It was a live-service game that players and critics thought lacked substance, and the memes began to pour forth poking fun at the “AAAA” statement. Now, <em>Skull and Bones</em> has launched wide, releasing on Steam to the masses. While the reception hasn’t appeared significantly better many months after its initial release, there is still potential for the game to improve and win over more players.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195805,196406" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That said, many genuinely enjoy the game, and a few took to the Steam reviews section to voice their opinions. Of course, they’re intermingled with extremely loud negativity. There’s even a bit of faux objectivity, as one reviewer included Ubisoft Connect, a boring story, and lackluster ship battles among the game’s cons and left their list of its pros completely blank. And, despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-joke-meme-reviews-unhelpful-steam-update-changes-1851622567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-joke-meme-reviews-unhelpful-steam-update-changes-1851622567">Valve’s best efforts</a></span>, there are the usual joke reviews.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocket-league-leak-teases-possible-%E2%80%98urban-legends%E2%80%99-event.968319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rocket-league-leak-teases-possible-urban-legends-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1829504366086123873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new post</a> on X today, reliable leaker SamLeakss claimed that Rocket League devs could be planning an event featuring Urban Legends.</p>



<p>Both SamLeakss and SpushFNBR state that this information is based on a leaked blog post from the devs. They claim the blog is titled “Rocket League Season 16 Urban Legends Emerge from the Arenas Darkest Depths.”</p>



<p>SamLeakss adds that “This Blog might go live this week, or could be the name of the upcoming Halloween event.” The Halloween season is quickly approaching, so the timing would certainly make sense. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Rocket League will soon be getting an "Urban Legends" Event, according to an upcoming leaked Blog Post 👀 </p><p>This Blog might go live this week, or could be the name of the upcoming Halloween event! Slenderman and Bigfoot are extremely likely for collaborations, as Season 16 is set… <a href="https://t.co/Fl4DyJrhMa">pic.twitter.com/Fl4DyJrhMa</a></p></div>— Sam (@SamLeakss) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamLeakss/status/1829504366086123873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The leaker also lists a few potential urban legends, such as Bigfoot, Mothman, and Slenderman. While this only appeared to be speculation, SamLeakss points out that the corresponding season will be set in a forest.</p>



<p>Notably, SamLeakss and SpushFNBR also suggest that the event’s themed cosmetics could end up in Fortnite, too. That’s based on previous events similarly coinciding with Fortnite.</p>



<p>At this time, the devs did not officially confirm the Urban Legends event or release the leaked blog.</p>



<p>Most recently, Rocket League just released a new Season Rush for Season 15 this week. Psyonix also revealed some competitive rewards, ahead of Season 15 concluding on September 4, 2024.</p>



<p>Rocket League recently appeared at the Esports World Cup 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-bds-wins-the-rocket-league-esports-world-cup-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team BDS won against Team Falcons</a> for the championship. The team earned $200,000 in prizing for their victory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-debuts-the-princess-sword-fighter-form<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo has released another trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, giving us our first look at the princess embracing her inner-Link, and wielding a sword and shield.</p>
<p>On the game's release, Zelda will find a mysterious sword hidden within the lands of Hyrule, which will allow her to transform into her sword fighting form. She will be able to fend off enemies and clear obstacles that block her path. However, while certainly handy, this form isn't permanent, and Zelda will need to replenish the sword by collecting energy for it from the Still World.</p>
<p>And, what is the Still World? I hear you ask! Well, this is the world found within those strange, purple aura rifts that now litter the kingdom. The land in this world is "distorted", and Zelda must work with Echoes of Wisdom's companion Tri to negotiate the many twists, turns and dungeons within.</p>

<p>Of course, when not using her sword to overcome any ordeal in her way, she will be able to use her Tri Rod, which allows her to copy and paste items she finds in the world. This can be seen again in the most recent trailer, when Zelda mid-battle whips out a bed to have a little lie down on. I mean, why not. Also, it sure does look like she is going to face off with Volvagia at some point during Echoes of Wisdom. I am sure I recognise <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>'s Fire Temple dragon.</p>
<p>Speaking of returning characters, Dampé will also show up in Echoes of Wisdom, as an "engineer of clockwork gizmos", who has a "knack for creating automatons". The automatons can be used in battle. But, enough from me. You can check out the latest trailer for Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom in the video above. And, I have thoughts on that final frame...</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on 26th September, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sits.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gearboxs-first-risk-of-rain-2-dlc-is-apparently-a-complete-disaster.968292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gearbox-risk-of-rain-2-dlc-review-bomb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gearbox has released its first&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>DLC since acquiring the IP almost two years ago, and it's safe to say that the release has not gone well for the studio at all.</p>
<p>Former owner Hopoo Games sold the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain&nbsp;</em>IP to Gearbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gearbox-acquires-risk-of-rain-ip-from-hopoo-games">in November 2022</a>, and the game's first DLC since that transfer,&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">out now</a>. Unfortunately, it's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attracted a Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam in the three days since its release.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/gearboxs-first-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-gets-hammered-on-steam-as-developer-admits-the-pc-version-is-in-a-really-bad-place/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PC Gamer report</a>, Gearbox's woes began when players pointed out that the price of&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm&nbsp;</em>was disproportionately expensive when compared to previous expansion&nbsp;<em>Survivors of the Void</em>. To Gearbox's credit, it did <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4575181680239699091" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post an update on Steam yesterday</a> addressing this issue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/risk-of-rain-2-dlc-gearbox-disaster-combat.jpg?itok=y9SrxE-J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/risk-of-rain-2-dlc-gearbox-disaster-combat.jpg?itok=7uCrTAzU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not going well for Gearbox when it comes to the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that's not where Gearbox's woes end with regards to&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>. As noted by PC Gamer, an update released with the expansion has effectively broken the base&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>game, whether you've bought the DLC or not.</p>
<p>According to PC Gamer's report, said update has "tied&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2</em>'s physics systems to its frame rate", essentially breaking a number of elements in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These elements include an <a href="https://x.com/FunyonD/status/1828666364036346029" rel="noopener" target="_blank">entire character seemingly failing to function</a>, an issue which Gearbox head Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1828917052955922737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subsequently referred to</a> as "jank we've just sort of tolerated", pledging to "have another look". How magnanimous of you, Randy.</p>
<p>Per PC Gamer, a Gearbox developer told those in the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>Discord server that "all the ramifications on balance/physics/attack speed/movement/etc. were not intentional", advising that players lock the game to 60fps to prevent further issues.</p>

<p>This is an issue Gearbox will likely want to fix as soon as it can. Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/632360/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB's charts</a>,&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>hit an all-time player high of 75,406 when&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm&nbsp;</em>launched, so it's clear this DLC has attracted lots of new and returning players to the game.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, Pitchford himself <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1828916842200740113" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> he's "super, super proud" of what Gearbox accomplished with&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm</em>, inviting players to "blame [him]" for any problems they experience. Then again, he does also sign off with "whatever the case, don't be a hater", so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what happens next with regards to&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, but if you do want to check the game out (and don't mind that it appears to be broken), you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on PC via Steam</a>, as well as on consoles.</p>

After finding the blade, Zelda will gain the ability to shift into a very Link-like swordfighter form that’s timed to a magical energy gauge. In her swordfighter form, Zelda seems to be a bit more nimble and able to block enemy attacks with a shield, but she can only maintain the form for a limited amount of time before needing to refill her magic with mysterious energy found throughout the game.</p><p>While Zelda’s new form will give players a way to hack and slash their way through enemies, the new trailer really spotlights how sword fighting is just one of the skills you’re meant to cleverly deploy while exploring the world. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>hits the Switch on September 26th, 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Clearly, you should set all of these to whatever difficulty you feel most comfortable with, and very impressively, none of them impact things like trophies or achievements.</p><p>Remember:<strong> the entire goal of a video game is to have the most fun possible</strong>, and only you can decide what that looks like for you.</p><h2 id="h116730"><a id=""></a><strong>Access for everyone</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-recommend-id="image://1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nix, looking up from the floor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nix, looking up from the floor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-recommend-id="image://1c17baa933f15b0d3a077f029ae736ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nix, looking up from the floor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has an abundance of accessibility-focused settings, too, including Cognitive, Colors, Vision, and Hearing. Each is home to an impressive number of options that can be deeply customized to your liking. Some of these options cross over with the general difficulty settings mentioned above, but you’ll find that there’s more granular control over those features under their respective settings.</p><p>Each person’s accessibility needs are different, obviously, but some settings we’d recommend <em>everyone</em> look over are related to mini-games. While slicing and lockpicking can be fun on their default settings, you can opt to adjust their intensity, or have them autocomplete if needed. Additionally, turning on “fast mode” for the Kessel Sabacc card game will speed matches up considerably, while swapping the card headers to “simple numerals” will make the cards much easier to identify (at the very minor cost of a bit of authenticity, perhaps).</p><p>Regardless of the accessibility needs you have, though, here’s an idea of what to expect when you dive into <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>’s detail settings.</p><h2 id="h116731"><a id=""></a><strong>Gameplay settings</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-recommend-id="image://b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gameplay settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gameplay settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-recommend-id="image://b2697abeb757a1a86c48b39ea66e4dac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gameplay settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, it’s possible to change the difficulty such that you can boost your own health and lower that of enemies, or if you prefer, reverse than and make the challenge far harder. Or any combination. You can also switch on Fall Protection if you find fall damage misery-inducing, and tweak every minigame, including Galactic Street Food challenges and Fast-talk time challenges. There’s also a collection of options to make space flight less dangerous.</p><h2 id="h116732"><a id=""></a><strong>Cognitive and Vision settings</strong></h2><p>The Cognitive and Vision settings overlap in a few different ways, granting you control over things like HUD size, contrast modes, and the aforementioned mini-game settings related to lockpicking, slicing, and more. You can also turn on full menu narration, and enable audio descriptions that will tell you the major events of any cinematics that play.</p><h2 id="h116733"><a id=""></a><strong>Color settings</strong></h2><p>The Color settings let you individually customize dialogue text color, speaker name color, and caption text color. Alternatively, it offers presets for multiple types of colorblindness, including protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia.</p><h2 id="h116734"><a id=""></a><strong>Hearing settings</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="7fb0ca3250e86a006820c482d3393b36" data-recommend-id="image://7fb0ca3250e86a006820c482d3393b36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hearing settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hearing settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fb0ca3250e86a006820c482d3393b36" data-recommend-id="image://7fb0ca3250e86a006820c482d3393b36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hearing settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Hearing settings are largely related to subtitles. You have the option to change the background color and opacity of the subtitle background, as well as decide whether you want to see subtitles for background sounds. You can even turn on additional visual cues for the lockpicking mini-game here.</p><p>For those with cognitive or motor control needs, when you first boot the game, you can save yourself a bunch of time by selecting the “Motor Preset” and “Cognitive Preset,” which automatically enable all of the above, along with lowering trigger intensity and reduces the need for repeated button tapping, or improving clarity, adding more markers, and control setting reminders.</p><p>It’s wonderful to see so many accessibility settings available in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, and here’s to wishing for a day when all of these customizable options will be the default in every game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a <a href="https://puck.news/how-the-wbd-fire-sale-could-play-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> via Puck, WB could be working on a new game based on the Penguin that is set in Matt Reeves’ popular The Batman universe. </p>



<p>The report claims that “various WBD divisions are beginning to collaborate more closely on properties like the upcoming Penguin HBO show and game, both seeded in the 2022 The Batman movie.”</p>



<p>They add that “when Zaslav took over, many advised him to offload games,” but Zaslav “still sees the games unit as strategic.”</p>



<p>At this time, official sources did not confirm anything about the potential Penguin game nor issue a statement about the report. Also, Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify the rumor.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Further, Puck’s own report mentions that Zaslav’s “assessment could change soon” regarding Warner’s games unit. So, nothing is concrete about the Penguin game.</p>



<p>HBO plans to premiere its limited series based on Matt Reeves’ iteration of the Penguin in late September 2024. It will run for eight episodes, through November 2024.</p>



<p>HBO has already released a couple of trailers for the anticipated show. Many praised Colin Farrell as a highlight of Reeves’ The Batman film, and could certainly enjoy a game based on that version of the character.</p>



<p>Just last week, Meta Quest 3 exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow also got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-gameplay-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay trailer</a> and an October 2024 release window.</p>



<hr>



<p>For more of the latest gaming industry news, you can read about a new report claiming that NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-developer-ouka-studios-reportedly-facing-possible-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to shut down</a> Visions of Man developer Ouka Studios, and sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming newsletter</a>.</p>

    <p><span>Introducing the Still World, Swordfighter form, and the engineer Dampe.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,732 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has released a new trailer for <em><a title="Games > The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> introducing the Still World, Swordfighter form, and the engineer Dampe. <span id="more-911247"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>The land of Hyrule has been torn apart by mysterious <a title="Platforms > Rift" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/rift">Rift</a>s. In search of Link and the king of Hyrule, both of whom were stolen away, Princess Zelda must borrow the power of an ethereal creature called Tri. Together, they enter the tears that scar the land in order to save her kingdom. On her journey, Zelda will explore what lies within the Rifts.</p><p><strong>Navigating the Still World</strong></p><p>This is the Still World. Here, trees, fragments of land, people, and other items that were swallowed up by the Rifts float in the void. It’s said they will eventually vanish completely. Exploring the farthest reaches of this world is no easy feat. To do so, Zelda will have to traverse eerie floating terrain. Because the path is broken up, the Echoes you’ve learned can come in handy. Forge your own way forward by creating Echoes to use as platforms to bridge the gaps.</p><p>Massive dungeons can also be found deep within the Still World. Zelda will use her wisdom and Echoes to take on enemies and puzzles that stand in her way, then confront challenging bosses who await her arrival. What to do though? Overwhelm the boss with Echoes? Or combine them to find unique ways around the situation? The strategy is yours to devise.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Still World can be accessed through Rifts scattered across Hyrule, and each entry point leads to a location with its own defining features. On her <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,726 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, Zelda must overcome dungeons within the Rifts and the mysteries they hold. Without Link or the king, Hyrule’s fate rests squarely in Zelda’s hands.</p><p><strong>Swordfighter Form</strong></p><p>When Zelda finds and picks up a mysterious sword, she takes on the Swordfighter form, allowing her to attack directly. With its mighty power, she can forge ahead when her path is blocked, strike down enemies on her own, or battle alongside Echoes. However, she can only stay in Swordfighter form for a short period of time. When or where you choose to wield this power is up to you. The sword’s gauge can be replenished by collecting energy found in the Still World, so be sure to grab any you find.</p><p><strong>Inhabitants of Hyrule</strong></p><p>This is Dampe, an engineer who crafts clockwork gizmos in Hyrule. His extravagant creations are called Automatons, and they can be activated by winding them up. They can unleash powerful effects that differentiate them from Echoes, but be careful—they’ll break apart if they take too much damage. You’ll meet many other quirky characters during your travels, and there’s no doubt they’ll be of great help to the princess.</p><p>On a journey to traverse and save Hyrule, Princess Zelda’s wisdom is key to undertaking this adventure.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,919 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on September 26.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><h2><span>Into the Still World, a Journey Continued</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Into the Still World, a Journey Continued — Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUdJF8gyO4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="ゼルダの伝説 知恵のかりもの | ハイラルのあるきかた3 無の世界篇" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHALE0nvhl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-vii">Civilization VII</a> is coming at a really interesting time for the historical 4X genre, with a bunch of rivals having sprung up in the last few years, and everyone trying to explore similar concepts to better translate the passage of time and evolution of nations into video game form.</p>
<p>We got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/">hands on with the opening few turns at Gamescom 2024</a>, and alongside a breakdown by Firaxis for the overarching concepts and changes, it feels like an exciting new chapter for the storied franchise. But there’s always more to ask and to find out, and we had the opportunity to sit down with Creative Director Ed Beach to dive into what’s new, different and what’s staying the same in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-7">Civ 7</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><strong>TSA: So, change is very difficult for people to accept…</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed Beach:</b> We’ve noticed! Our forums are abuzz with that!</p>

<p><strong>TSA: [laughs] I mean, we’ll obviously talk about what’s different with Civ 7, but what kind of security blankets are there for people? What’s staying consistent and staying true to Civilization?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> The number one change that seems to have thrown our community, and that we were expecting to throw our community, is that your civilization changes are you get to each age. I think the security blanket that they’re going to realise is there, is that they’re thinking “I’m starting as Egypt, and the game is asking me to switch to India.”</p>
<p>They saw that in some of our competing products, and it was very jarring, but we have a historical pathway system that’s really going to make a lot of those choices much more logical within history. So certain areas of the world, like India and China, that have their own ecosystem of dynasties that evolved over time, a lot of people are thinking there’s one India in the game, but that’s not necessarily true anymore. We are not revealing our whole lineup of civilizations, because that’s part of our marketing campaign to roll that information out, but in an area where it makes sense for us to have a representation of, say, India in all three ages, that’s very much what we might want to do.</p>
<p>So that’s not that much different to playing India before, but now its much richer, because you might have not just abilities through one slice of the game. Like all of our empires before, you’d get to play America or England and have to wait for your abilities to come online, and you’re hoping in a multiplayer game that you don’t get crushed and wiped off the map before you’re relevant – now you have this much richer portrayal of a particular historical pathway, because you’re playing through three layers and they all have bonuses.</p>
<p>I think players will realise that’s actually very cool and very much improved over what was there before. Obviously there’s going to be cases where players can unlock a strange pathway, and some players will love doing that, while players who love the historical immersion may shy away from that. And that’s fine. Everyone should play the game the way that they want. But it should cater to both those historical enthusiasts who want it to be more traditional…</p>
<p><strong>TSA: Like those who want Egypt to always be exactly how it was…</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> But even then, Egypt ended up getting entirely conquered by the Ottoman Empire later in history, and how should that be represented?</p>

<p><strong>TSA: I think another part that might not be grasped on a surface level is that it’s called Egypt in the game, but obviously Egypt now is very different from Ancient Egypt.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> And if you look at something like Rome, Rome had influence everywhere and there’s a lot of modern empires that can say they did start with a big Roman influence, and that makes sense for me.</p>
<p>We’re launching the game with more civs than we’ve ever had before, because the more civs we have, the more of these pathways we can have, but it’s going to benefit even more as the mod community and our DLC packs start pumping even more into the game. It’s going to be really interesting all the ways you can navigate your way through history.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:&nbsp;</strong><strong>You alluded to your competitors, the rivals to your crown let’s say, and it’s a really interesting time for the historical 4X genre. Is it encouraging that so many minds are exploring a similar direction to yourselves? Especially as everyone has their own particular way of representing ages and evolving cultures.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> I feel like there was a catalyst to this, and maybe it’s slightly egotistical on our part to think that Civ 6 was a driver, but it was very successful, and obviously we sold lots of units, we have a big install base, and that’s the kind of situation where anyone with business sense is thinking “We can grab a piece of that pie and it’ll be very profitable for us too!”</p>
<p>There’s tons of activity in this space, which is good for everybody.</p>
<p>As we developed this product, we didn’t know we were going to have four competitors when we started. We had actually gotten very used to, the first ten years I was at Firaxis, we didn’t have competitors and they stayed away from the historical space. Like “We don’t want to take Civ on, so we’ll go and do Sci Fi or Fantasy”, and they did some very good jobs at those other genres, but the competition directly in the historical space was limited.</p>
<p>What we saw was one by one those competitors were popping up, and we were like, how much attention do we have to pay to them? We knew we wanted to break the game up into chapters to make it more manageable for players to get through to the end, because we had data on how many people bail out, and we wanted to address that problem directly.</p>
<p>We ended up being distracted a couple times by some of these competitors, but we ended up in the final analysis was that we stick to our plan. […]
</p><p>You can tell that we’re all poking at the same problems, because the name Ages is in our game as it is in Millennia, Influence is in our game and i think in Humankind. So we’re coming up with the same solutions, we’re trying to name things the same, even if they’re slightly different things, so we’re all poking at this idea of what makes a great historical strategy game and how to structure it. We had the advantage that Civ 6 was out there and still performing well, so we didn’t have to rush, so we could iterate on things quite a bit, and I think that’s been helpful.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: The Civ 6 expansion Rise and Fall tried to deal with this kind of, well it’s in the name really, rise and fall of empires. What can you say about how those ideas morphed into the Ages here.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> It’s a really good observation, because the thing we wanted to do with Rise and Fall was to not represent human progress as this ever-ascending ramp where players or empires are never being challenged and they can just keep on getting bigger and stronger. That’s traditionally what a Civ game has been, but it’s not really the way history works.</p>
<p>It’s much more, you grow so big that you don’t know how to control your empire anymore, outside invaders see that you have weaknesses and poke it, and so there’s some kind of crisis. You typically end up having to retrench, regroup and push forward again, but you’ve taken a step back.</p>
<p>Rise and Fall we experimented with that. We had the loyalty system where if you went into a dark age, you would lose cities at the edge of your empire. We’re taking inspiration from that idea, we have a Crisis system so there is a challenge at the end of each Age, and a natural reason why your empire starts to fall apart.</p>
<p>We have historians on the team and they’ve looked at when those time periods across the world, where there was a Dark Age everywhere, not just in the Roman Empire, but in the East where none of the big empires were surviving. So we’ve tried to slot the times that the crisis happens in, so there’s a historical story to tell there.</p>
<p>But there were a few things about Rise and Fall that we didn’t like, and you’ll notice in this game that a couple things have disappeared from Civ 6. The points system to get just enough Era score to evaluate if you go into a dark age or a golden age, and the tech and civic boosts –&nbsp;those systems did some good things, but they made players chase mini objectives almost to a level that was distracting from their strategic vision as an empire, so we’ve backed off that.</p>
<p>There’s still quests in the game – advisors give you quests, you can get quests from the narrative system –&nbsp;and there’s always the need to explore the map more to find discoveries, so we think we have enough short term objectives in the game without making the players keep track of all these little scores.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: I was also going to ask diplomacy and how some games will present all the numbers and how stats add up, other games will try to obscure it a little bit, and these mini objectives</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> You can just get an overload of too many little numbers and trackers and progress bars to fill up, and I don’t think that’s a fun game.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: I’ve mentioned it now, so let’s talk about diplomacy and if there any key ways that you’re shifting this side of the game?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> I didn’t feel quite as passionately about it as some members of my design team, but i agreed with them: the one thing they felt was unrealistic about Civ games all the way back to Civ 4… 3 actually, was the deal table. If you’re a great leader, you’re Augustus Caesar, you shouldn’t be haggling over the price of figs when you’re trying to trade them to your neighbour! That just didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>The diplomacy systems in Civ games had this weird incentive where the more time you spent going around to different leaders and trying to negotiate those deals with them? That was the best way to play, because you could go, “Oh this guy’s a little friendlier to me, he’ll give me a better deal. I just got this new commodity, let me get as much gold as possible.” There was this weird min-maxing game that A) took a lot of time, and B) didn’t feel like something a world leader should be doing.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: It’s more like a space trading game where you go from one port to another.</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> Exactly, and then the third thing about it was you were trading your luxury goods to other leaders through that interface, but we also had a trade route system and you establish routes to other players, but there was no connection between them. We always wanted them to be unified.</p>
<p>We have unified those, and when you set up a trade route to another player, that’s how you get their resources. There’s no deal table where you’re haggling over prices, now your merchants go out and bring commodities back. Everything you buy from another player, they’re going to earn gold from, and you get one free trade route with everybody, but if you want more trade routes with somebody, you need to be friendly enough that they’ll allow it. So diplomacy and trade are very tightly tied together, but it’s a brand new system that unifies a lot of what we felt needed to be unified.</p>

<p><strong>TSA: Finally, you’re keeping the unpacked city style from Civ 6, which was so visually arresting, but with the new transitions between civs, how are you evolving it for Civ 7?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> There’s three big changes. The first one is that each urban tile is not assigned a specialty –&nbsp;it’s not a science district or a culture district –&nbsp;you get two building slots there and you can put whatever building you want there.</p>
<p>There second thing is cities have to grow out from the centre. It used to be that you had the centre of your city here, and your first district could be way out on the edge of the [city’s area], and players were like, “That doesn’t feel like the same city, that feels like little suburbs.” So now your city has to grow out from the centre.</p>
<p>The third thing is that as you go from one age to the next, the city buildings from the previous age lose their power. The new buildings from the new age are much, much better, and you want them to be in the choice spots where you put the earlier buildings for adjacency bonuses and things like that, so we have this system where you over-build. In the presentation we talked about how London was built in layers, and that’s very interesting because now the same part of the map you’ll get to figure out how you want to lay out your cities on it multiple times through a game, and that gives you all sorts of opportunities for this building gameplay to evolve and improve as you’re working on it.</p>
<p><strong>TSA: Extending from that, is there anything where you visually merge the civilisations together?</strong></p>
<p><b>Ed:</b> If you play as Egypt and you get the special necropolis mortuary complex built on a tile, that’s permanent, and so even if you move on from Egypt to another empire, that Egyptian quarter remains. Think about cities that have, you know, Latin quarters, Jewish quarters and that was an inspiration to have these old quarters that are vestiges of the empire that used to live there, and as you go through the ages, your whole lineage starts to reveal itself to you on the map.</p>

			<p>The developers at GSC Game World are in the final stretch of development for STALKER 2 after going through lots of hardships. At Gamescom 2024, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov and Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka to discuss what's left before launch, and the optimization of the Xbox Series S version (with the help of the Xbox team) stood out.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>Well, our team is mature enough to take care of many aspects of the game themselves. Yet, the Xbox team knows best how the Xbox performs and what's better to do in a case like we need to go deeper into the optimization. The Microsoft team visited several times, providing essential expertise on what else we could do that we didn't think of. It's not over yet. Aside from Xbox Series X, we're still working on optimization for Xbox Series S. It's going well, and the Xbox team is contributing a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>On Xbox Series X, we have two available modes. One of them is Performance Mode, where STALKER 2 is running with 60 FPS and slightly different graphics than in Quality Mode, which looks super awesome with all the reflections and high-resolution textures, but runs at 30 FPS. We are trying to achieve a similar experience on Xbox Series S by combining these two approaches. So far, we have it at 25ish FPS on the Xbox Series S, but we still have space to optimize.</em></p>
<p>I also asked about the Game Pass partnership with Xbox, and GSC Game World expressed gratitude for all the support they've received from Microsoft during the making of STALKER 2.</p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong>&nbsp;That's right. That's a Game Pass partnership and Microsoft is not pushing us in any way to release on any date or just put the content out of the game or something like that. Actually, Microsoft, they are super supportive of us. We didn't exactly ask someone from Microsoft to be our friends, but Sarah Bond is obviously a friend of the game. Phil (Spencer) was super supportive, all the teams from Microsoft were. They didn't put any additional pressure on us.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out November 20 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, available on Game Pass from day one. Based on info from the Epic v. Apple legal fight, the game should be a console <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive</a> for Microsoft's platform for three months, although this was never acknowledged by either Microsoft or GSC Game World.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-studio-hit-by-huge-layoffs-on-release-day-per-report.968259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-layoffs-netease-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has alleged that&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>developer Ouka Studio has been hit by layoffs on the very day the game launched across the world.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Takashi Mochizuki</a> (who, in turn, cites the old chestnut "people familiar with the matter"), Ouka's owner NetEase has "cut all but a handful of jobs" at its Tokyo studio, with a view to eventually closing the company completely.</p>
<p>Mochizuki goes on to say that NetEase's plan is to "shut the Shibuya outfit" (i.e. the Tokyo branch), with a handful of employees remaining to oversee the rollout of Ouka's final games before it "winds down".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-layoffs-report-creatures.jpg?itok=9HC3IuSP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-layoffs-report-creatures.jpg?itok=jblHS9oF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s developer has reportedly been hit by huge layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>What makes this layoff report particularly cruel is the timing.&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date">launched just yesterday</a>, earning itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/visions-of-mana-review-exceptional-venture">a very favorable review</a> from our very own Brittany, so the studio behind the game suffering layoffs feels especially unfortunate in light of that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Ouka's owner NetEase hasn't officially confirmed these layoffs; in a statement given to Mochizuki and Bloomberg, NetEase said it had "nothing to announce" with regards to Ouka's closure.</p>
<h2>Ouka's layoffs are reportedly part of a wider trend</h2>
<p>Per the Bloomberg report, the layoffs at Ouka are part of a wider trend concerning Chinese companies pulling out of Japanese investments amidst a resurgence of the Chinese game market and a lack of success in Japan.</p>
<p>Mochizuki says that both NetEase and gaming giant Tencent are reconsidering investments in Japanese studios. The report gives the example of&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending">recently canceled in the West</a>; Tencent was to develop and publish the mobile version of that game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-tencent-netease-report.jpg?itok=u_bUauwB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-tencent-netease-report.jpg?itok=e5DenCQ4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol&nbsp;</em>is one of the games that has frustrated Chinese companies like Tencent with regards to Japanese investments, according to Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure><p>Bloomberg quotes analyst Robin Zhu as saying that while Tencent and NetEase have no intention of pulling out of partnerships with big studios like Capcom and Bandai Namco, the gaming giants are perhaps "scrutiniz[ing] their returns more closely".</p>
<p>Zhu says that Tencent and NetEase may be following a wider industry trend of scaling back headcounts or investments, and also that "anecdotally", Japanese studios' "desire to tightly control" their IP has been a "source of friction" between Japanese outfits and Chinese companies.</p>
<p>The Chinese gaming market has also opened up in recent months. GameScience's&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million">topped 10 million sales</a> just a few days out from release, and HoYoverse games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>have also seen success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss.jpg?itok=k3gcAklc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-boss.jpg?itok=J7yGO_I8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is spearheading a Chinese gaming industry resurgence.</figcaption></figure><p>In recent years, NetEase has made big investments in Japanese industry legends like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on"><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>producer Ryutaro Ichimura</a>, former Capcom exec <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease">Hiroyuki Kobayashi</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios">Toshihiro Nagoshi</a>.</p>
<p>Whether this reported shift in the company's strategy will make a difference to these investments remains to be seen, but NetEase told Bloomberg it's always "making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions". Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/tencent-netease-rethink-japan-approach-as-game-strategy-stalls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> via Bloomberg, NetEase could potentially shut down Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios.</p>



<p>The report says that NetEase possibly “intends to shut the Shibuya outfit.” It adds that NetEase “has cut all but a handful of jobs at its Ouka studio in Tokyo.” </p>



<p>Bloomberg later elaborated <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1829342570042048776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that NetEase has issued these staff reductions “since this spring at least.”</p>



<p>Both Tencent and NetEase are also reportedly reconsidering a variety of investments in Japanese studios. This may be because “years of spending yielded few hit games.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Tencent and NetEase are rethinking their Japan investment as Japanese developers failed to produce hit games. NetEase cut many staff at Ouka Studio with a plan to shut it down while Tencent backed off from funding commitments on several projects.<a href="https://t.co/89nXAwVFYa">https://t.co/89nXAwVFYa</a></p>— Takashi Mochizuki (@6d6f636869) <a href="https://twitter.com/6d6f636869/status/1829320388817686780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At this time, neither Tencent nor NetEase issued official confirmation that there are plans to shut down Ouka Studios. However, the new report does include statements from each company.</p>



<p>Tencent said that it “remains committed to its partner studios and developing its business in Japan.” NetEase stated that it has “nothing to announce” regarding Ouka Studios closing down. </p>



<p>However, a NetEase spokesperson said that “we craft our strategy based on our goal of providing better gaming experiences to local and global players.” They added that NetEase is “always making necessary adjustments to reflect market conditions.”</p>



<p>Ouka Studios only just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-launches-on-august-29-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released Visions of Mana</a> a day ago, and it already has solid critic reviews on Metacritic. Visions of Mana is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is not currently available on Xbox Game Pass, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-not-releasing-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as previously announced</a>.</p>

As the brand-new trailblazing journey on the Xianzhou Luofu continues to unfold, players will have the opportunity to recruit new five-star characters, including Feixiao, the General of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, who will also feature in the Echo of War, as well as Lingsha, the new Cauldron Master from the Alchemy Commission of the Xianzhou Luofu, and Moze, the reticent and silent Shadow Guard of the Yaoqing, who has already played and will continue to be an important role in the upcoming adventure.</p><p>Following a recent prison break in The Shackling Prison, the Cloud Knights have swiftly arrived to initiate rescue efforts. General Feixiao will personally lead her troops to capture the escaped Borisin criminals and secure the surface of the Luofu. Meanwhile, General Jing Yuan will investigate the incident, while General Huaiyan will oversee the Luofu’s Six Commissions. As long-buried secrets within the Shackling Prison are revealed, this trailblazing silkpunk saga will race toward its climax. Meanwhile, the Luminary Wardance is set to ignite in Version 2.5, attracting numerous participants, including familiar faces like Luka, who is visiting Xianzhou Luofu for the first time. Trailblazers who engage in activities related to the Luminary Wardance can earn the charming pet “Tuskpir” as a companion. Alongside the Wardance ceremony, the Xianzhou will host other exciting events, inviting Trailblazers to dive in and explore!</p><p>As the excitement of the Wardance unfolds, a formidable new ally emerges on the battlefield. Feixiao, the Merlin’s Claw of Xianzhou Yaoqing and one of the Seven Arbiter-Generals will enter the battlefield as a 5-star playable character. Renowned for her unrestrained and straightforward nature, Feixiao is a master of all forms of martial arts, having refined herself into the ultimate weapon. Revered by both Xianzhou soldiers and civilians, she is celebrated as “The Vanquishing General.” During battles, General Feixiao fights across the cosmos and works closely with her allies. After her teammates strike an enemy, she follows up with a powerful attack. She accumulates “Flying Aureus” with every few attacks. This Spiritus, granted by the Reignbow, fuels her power and duty. Not only does Feixiao gather “Flying Aureus” from her attacks, but she also benefits from her teammates’ strikes. When she uses her Ultimate, Feixiao consumes the Flying Aureus and carries out a series of powerful attacks on the enemy with her gunblades or battle-axe. These strikes reduce the enemy’s Toughness while bypassing their Weakness Type and enhance her Weakness Break Efficiency. In Version 2.5, Feixiao will also introduce a new trial for Trailblazers: “Echo of War: Inner Beast’s Battlefield.” In this trial, players will face a shadow of Feixiao and the apparition of Flying Aureus—Ecliptic Inner Beast.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_911218"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Another highly anticipated five-star character from the Xianzhou allies, Lingsha, will join the playable roster. With her keen sense of smell, she diagnoses illnesses and uses incense to soothe others. Skilled in managing complex social interactions, she maintains a calm and serene demeanor even when she’s agitated inside. In battle, Lingsha stands out with her ability to summon Fuyuan, an incense beast she created. Fuyuan assists in combat, but dissipates after a few actions. Lingsha can use her Skill to extend Fuyuan’s actions, allowing it to perform follow-up attacks. This attack not only deals damage to all enemies, but also dispels one debuff from allies and restores their HP as well. When Lingsha uses her Ultimate, she deals damage to all enemies, heals all allies, and inflicts the Befog state, which increases Break damage on enemies. As a reliable Cauldron Master, Lingsha ensures her allies are well-protected.</p><p>In addition, Moze, the 4-star Shadow Guard of the Yaoqing will make his debut as a playable character. Known for his reticence- and solitary nature, Moze operates in secrecy, rarely revealing himself. In battle, he marks a single enemy as the Prey and then enters the Departed state while the Prey is on the field. After allies attack the Prey, Moze deals additional damage. Additionally, Moze’s Ultimate deals DMG to enemies and launches a follow-up attack. With his elusive tactics and deadly precision, Moze brings a new level of strategy and intrigue to the battlefield.</p><p>A special Warp Event will kick off in the first half of Version 2.5, featuring the return of limited 5-star characters Robin, Black Swan, and Kafka. The Warp count for the guaranteed 5-star will be shared across rerun and current limited banners. Switching banners won’t reset the guarantee count. In the second half of Version 2.5, the limited 5-star character Topaz will have a rerun.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,838 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/creation-of-parallax-occlusion-mapping-pom-in-unreal-engine-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s still a problem understanding such a complex approach in materials like POM and we’ll try to deeply understand how to use POM and as short as possible. Also we’re going to explain what each node does and why we use each one of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s start with what materials are in Unreal Engine? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Materials in Unreal Engine define the surface properties of the objects in your scene. A material is something like a "paint" that defines the visual appearance of an object.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now what is POM? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) is a complex texture-based approach to add more details for meshes.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> With POM we get more depth visually than we could get just with Normal maps, because we get three-dimensional shapes without adding any additional vertices to meshes. POM uses Ray Tracing to find the correct offsets at each point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So why is Parallax Occlusion better than making subdivision to meshes?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s faster than modeling since you can put it on any mesh;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Easy to set - you can do it with all textures if they’re correctly made.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are also some things that you should remember:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POM adds texel height data, separately from the texel normal data;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each fragment of data is ray-traced on the GPU to determine the correct visual result, resolving all of the above limitations. This gives an exceedingly realistic result under many viewing conditions, at the expense of substantial GPU time;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We still use the same textures that we would. The difference is we also add a displacement map and a few more nodes to our material;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POM doesn’t really work with overlapping UV and can look bad if you have wrong UV;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On low scalability POM won’t be visible at all. You should have AT LEAST medium scalability;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POM is a complex function and we need a lot of nodes that should be also correctly configured, otherwise we’re going to get artifacts;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">POV doesn’t work very well with shadow maps, so PROBABLY you have to untick “cast shadow map” for a mesh to which you have given a POV material.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So let’s create a POM material. First, let’s create a material. Press the right mouse button in “Content browser” and pick “Material”, now you should name it. Since it will be a master material, let’s name it M_POMbricks or MM_POMbricks. The difference between “Master Material” and “Material Instance” is like a parent to a child in programming. If a parent has some values a child will get them too, but a change of values of a child won’t affect a parent. The connection between them is called a “Parameter”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve got now a completely clean material and we need textures. We can make our own textures, but our main subject is POM , so let’s press the right mouse button on “Content Browser” and pick “Add Quixel Content”. Find a brick material. In my case it’s “BRICK WALL”. Download it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After downloading it, open the material that we created before by pressing the left mouse button twice. To have these textures, you have to select the textures of “BRICK WALL” and move it to the Material Graph. Then you should connect them all like in the screenshot below.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The texture with usual colors without any information about light (Albedo) belongs to “Base color”, it gives colors that we need to see in a brick wall in this case. The blue texture belongs to “Normal”, because it gives depth. But the yellow texture that we call “ARD” texture differs from others, because it has a few textures inside in different channels, so we’re going to use some of them. ARD = Ambient occlusion + Roughness + Displacement, that’s why we connected like what’s on the screenshot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s create more nodes so we could finally have a POM effect. To create a node press the right mouse button inside of the material graph and write the name of your node. Or press the palette and find the nodes that you need. In the screenshot there are names for each node.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Constant - is a number that we’re going to need to give a numerical value. It’s a little green node. Press the right mouse button and type “Constant”, then press the left mouse button on it. Names of other nodes you can see in screenshots below.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s continue. You see that constante nodes have different names in the screenshots? It’s because they’re not just nodes, they’re Parameters. Now you have to press the right mouse button on them and press “Convert to Parameter”, then you name them like in these screenshots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let’s explore each node. What does each of them mean?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1)Channel (it’s called so because we named it like that after making this node a Parameter) - is a four-vector constant, to create it you need to write not just “constant”, but “constant4vector”. As we wrote before, this node controls which channel is going to be provided to ParallaxOcclusionMapping. If you remember what we wrote about ARD, then you can guess that we’re going to use “B” channel, which means we have to make it completely Blue, so it should be 0,0,1,0. Also we used the node “Append”, because ParallaxOcclusionMapping expects us to give value of constant4vector (that’s why there’s written V4) and since four-vectors constantes have Alpha channel we give the color (B channel) and alpha.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2)Texture Coordinate controls scaling of the texture. Create another node and connect it to “Multiply” (this node multiplies two connected values), create another node and connect it too. Now you can scale it. We need texture coordinates and the scale depends on the scene you’re creating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3)Height Ratio (Parameter of one-vector constant) - controls values of our height map, in other words controls how much POM this material will be. We will write 0.3 as a default value and we’re going to change it in a material instance that we’re going to create, because everything depends on the textures that we use.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">4)Min Steps and Max Steps - Values for making POV smooth. The more steps we have, the more smooth it becomes, it’s like the modifier “Subdivision” in Blender.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you see we connected ParallaxOcclusionMapping to the textures, but we also connected “Pixel Depth Offset” of both nodes. We did it because otherwise we won’t have any POV effect. But again as I mentioned before, since we use Pixel Depth Offset, most likely you should turn off “Cast shadow” on actors on which we’re going to use our materials since they don’t work together very well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We now understand why we created such nodes for the POM effect. Keep in mind that Material Instances with Parameters help us in making materials and this case shouldn’t be an exception either.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end of this article it would be great to add a few more things that could help you:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Texture resolution affects memory and bandwidth. They will cause lag and freezes. How you handle resolution depends totally on you;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you get the warning “The current material has compilation errors, so it will not render currently in feature level SM6”, then you probably forgot to make the node Constant4Vector (Heightmap on images in this article) a Parameter;</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Written by Alexander Mukhitdinov, game developer of Skyhell, mentor and co-founder of Cube of Skill.

Under the stewardship of CEO Wade Rosen, the company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-relaunches-infogrames-immediately-buys-totally-reliable-delivery-service">revived the Infogrames label earlier this year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to publish a "core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand," while also developing new collections and sequels.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about Atari's publishing drive at Gamescom 2024, Rosen said the company hopes to position Infogrames as a "preservationist" publisher that can acquire franchises from developers who simply don't have the resources or bandwidth to support them anymore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Infogrames is pretty unique in that we had a lot of opportunities coming to us of games or IPs that people wanted to sell because they felt like they shouldn't just disappear," says Rosen, noting that's precisely why it acquired Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Awesomenauts, and Surgeon Simulator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As those deals started to stack up, Atari resurrected Infogrames to provide a home for a growing number of franchises that didn't neatly fit into other business segments. "We felt like Infogrames was the right place to have those series and carry them on. So, for Infogrames it's really about games that developers and publishers have moved on from–that probably still have some life in them," continues Rosen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal is to then [engage in] preservationist publishing. What that means for each title will be variable. Sometimes it's just making it accessible on more platforms. Sometimes it's remastering. Sometimes it's sequels."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Atari boss says the company must acknowledge its limitations in a 'tough' market">Atari boss says the company must acknowledge its limitations in a 'tough' market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a fascinating model in that Atari isn't really interested in speaking with developers about new projects. Rosen explains those deals wouldn't give the company a "competitive advantage." and notes that corner of the market is already dominated by major players like Devolver Digital and Annapurna. Atari has no intention of stepping on their toes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We're really interested in] IPs that have been out for a long time, that people have moved on from. The people who want to focus on their future projects and want to raise capital to make new games and focus on those–that's really what Infogrames is looking for," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Why we don't typically look at unreleased projects is I don't think we're more qualified to do that than anyone else. I don't think we have a competitive advantage. I don't think we're the best in the world at it. Best in class at it. So, really, why would we do it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen says Atari is targeting "straightforward" and "clean" IP acquisitions. He feels it's tough to work on a franchise if there are lots of "complications" and red tape. In the long-term, pursuing those deals should help the company mitigate risk. That's vital for Rosen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He acknowledges publishing is a "tough business" fraught with uncertainty, and that's why you have to carve out a visible niche. "There's not a really strong moat around this space, so competition can increase rapidly and decrease rapidly. The ones that survive have a strong brand," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think that's the only way indie [publishing] works. You have to become a publisher that transcends those games, and than have the discipline to choose games that support that [brand]. That probably means saying 'no' to games that could be commercially viable, but might be confusing to your target demographic. That's why we started Infogrames."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving forward, Atari is "definitely" in the market for more IPs and it's evident Rosen has a personal shopping list. He explains Atari's rich history in arcades means it's always interested in nabbing vintage morsels from that era. That tallies with the company's decision to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-acquires-the-rights-to-100-classic-franchises-including-bubsy-and-hardball">nab the rights to 100 classic franchises in one fell swoop last year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's always worth having a few moonshots in mind, too, and Rosen says he'd personally love to do something with Ogre Battle, the classic tactical-RPG currently owned by Square Enix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I loved Ogre Battle. I know Tactics Ogre, they just put out the remaster, which is basically a port of the PSP game. But love that world. I would love to see us to something with Ogre Battle at some point," he adds. "Tactics Ogre is pretty well covered. Even if it's not an acquisition–if Square is reading this please let us remaster Ogre Battle."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

The full patch notes are available below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Deadlock is a six versus six, third person hero shooter with a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) twist, taking inspiration from genre classics such as Leage of Legends, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm.</p><p>Valve seemingly looked to keep it a secret for weeks despite data showing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">thousands of players were already online</a>, but has now acknowledged its existence proper with an official Steam page.

This was released as the last 2D Final Fantasy game in 1994, before Final Fantasy 7 arrived on the original PlayStation and redefined the franchise in 1997.</p><p>"In terms of the Final Fantasy that I think is the ‘most complete'; I believe Final Fantasy 6 comes close, and does stand out above the other Final Fantasies, especially because it was the last Final Fantasy to use pixel art in all of its visual expression," Sakaguchi said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Screens - Final Fantasy VI (PC)</h3></div></output><p>Final Fantasy 6 is certainly among the most beloved in the franchise and introduced the now synonymous steampunk elements for the first time, moving away from the strictly medieval fantasy setting of previous games.</p><p>Though it's been ported to myriad consoles and devices already, fans are calling for Square Enix to release a full remake in the same vein as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-three-part-trilogy">the incoming third and final game</a>.</p><p>Final Fantasy 6 director Yoshinori Kitase didn't offer much hope when asked, however, as he said a remake akin to that of Final Fantasy 7's could take around 20 years to complete. Final Fantasy 6 features so much content that he estimated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-6-remake-would-take-about-20-years-to-make-original-director-says">it would take twice the length of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lots-of-square-enix-staff-want-to-remake-final-fantasy-6">Kitase previously commented on the popularity of the idea though</a>, even saying many developers within Square Enix are eager to work on a remake of Final Fantasy 6. The project would be very difficult, however, and Kitase said he couldn't think about it at least until the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy has wrapped.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Its popularity has been steadily increasing throughout August and will surely continue to do so, especially as the weekend approaches.</p><p>But what makes Deadlock's success particularly interesting and definitely strange is that it's not officially out yet. Valve seemingly looked to keep the game a secret for weeks despite, again, SteamDB showing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">thousands of players were already online</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It was released in this beta or playtesting equivalent state and still remains that way, with players only able to join if invited directly by Valve or referred by someone already playing. Those who did get in were asked to "not share anything about the game with anyone."</p><p>Valve has actually acknowledged Deadlock's existence now, however, by taking down that request and unveiling its official Steam page. "Deadlock is a multiplayer game in early development," it says, still vaguely.</p><p>Deadlock is actually a six versus six, third person hero shooter with a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) twist, taking inspiration from genre classics such as Leage of Legends, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm.</p><p>Valve hasn't shared when players can join freely or when a full release may come, but as its numbers grow, the "invite only" status becomes less and less meaningful.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth Wukong on PlayStation 5 uses AMD FSR 2 over TSR, and this is likely due to a few factors, including the usage of the very first version of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry recently talked about Game Science's decision to go with AMD's upscaler for the PlayStation 5 version of the game, highlighting how this could be a simple leftover from when the game was being developed in Unreal Engine 4. Frame generation, which is used in Performance mode, may also have played a part in the decision. The most likely reason, however, could be that Black Myth Wukong uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5. In this version of the game development engine, TSR is more demanding than in the latest, and it lacks specific optimizations for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Still, console users don't seem to be missing out much, as, while TSR looks better than FSR 2 in some scenarios, producing less ghosting and flickering, it still isn't particularly good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong - Why Did The Devs Choose FSR2 Over TSR Upscaling?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDdWyrgo0eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong has yet to be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as Game Science is reportedly dealing with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/">critical tech issues</a>, but Digital Foundry seems to be certain how the Xbox Series S isn't causing the delay. The game is not CPU bound, and Unreal Engine 5 is not heavy on VRAM, which should make it easy for the developers to scale things down and have the game run decently on the system, although features like Lumen and other visual settings, including resolution, will obviously get toned down. A subpar experience, however, could be caused by the team's inexperience with console development, as the PlayStation 5 version highlighted. As long as weird optimization choices aren't made, such as using frame generation in Performance mode to go from 30 to 60 FPS, everything should be fine. There's also the chance that Game Science could go with different choices, resulting in a slightly better experience than the one currently offered on PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/3/">first ROG Ally from Asus</a>, a $700 Windows-based handheld gaming PC, performed better than the Steam Deck, but it did so through notable compromises on battery life. The hardware also had a first-gen feel and software jank from both Asus’ own wraparound gaming app and Windows itself. The Ally asked an awkward question: “Do you want to pay nearly 50 percent more than you'd pay for a Steam Deck for a slightly faster but far more awkward handheld?”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/">ROG Ally X</a> makes that question more interesting and less obvious to answer. Yes, it’s still a handheld that’s trying to hide Windows annoyances, and it's still missing trackpads, without which some PC games just feel bad. And (review spoiler) it still eats a charge faster than the Steam Deck OLED on less demanding games.</p>
<p>But the improvements Asus made to this X sequel are notable, and its new performance stats make it more viable for those who want to play more demanding games on a rather crisp screen. At $800, or $100 more than the original ROG Ally with no extras thrown in, you have to really, <em>really</em> want the best possible handheld gaming experience while still tolerating Windows' awkward fit.</p>

<p>The ROG Ally X is essentially the ROG Ally with a bigger battery packed into a shell that is impressively not much bigger or heavier, more storage and RAM, and two USB-C ports instead of one USB-C and one weird mobile port that nobody could use. Asus reshaped the device and changed the face-button feel, and it all feels noticeably better, especially now that gaming sessions can last longer. The company also moved the microSD card slot so that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader">your cards don’t melt</a>, which is nice.</p>
<p>There’s a bit more to each of those changes that we’ll get into, but that’s the short version. Small spec bumps wouldn’t have changed much about the ROG Ally experience, but the changes Asus made for the X version do move the needle. Having more RAM available has a sizable impact on the frame performance of demanding games, and you can see that in our benchmarks.</p>
<p>We kept the LCD Steam Deck in our benchmarks because its chip has roughly the same performance as its OLED upgrade. But it’s really the Ally-to-Ally-X comparisons that are interesting; the Steam Deck has been fading back from AAA viability. If you want the Ally X to run modern, GPU-intensive games as fast as is feasible for a battery-powered device, it can now do that a lot better—for longer—and feel a bit better while you do.</p>
<p>The Rog Ally X has better answered the question “why not just buy a gaming laptop?” than its predecessor. At $800 and up, you might still ask how much portability is worth to you. But the Ally X is not as much of a niche (Windows-based handheld) inside a niche (moderately higher-end&nbsp;handhelds).                                                                        </p>
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>I normally would not use this kind of handout image with descriptive text embedded, but Asus is right: the ROG Ally X is indeed way more comfortable (just maybe not all-caps).</p><p>Asus</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How it feels using the Rog Ally X</h2>
<p>My testing of the Rog Ally X consisted of benchmarks, battery testing, and playing some games on the couch. Specifically: <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-will-mine-hours-of-auto-shooting-joy-from-your-life/">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a></i> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/tactical-breach-wizards-weaves-engaging-tactics-with-lively-dialogue/"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a> on the devices lowest-power setting (“Silent”), <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/deathloop-review-a-dishonorable-bethesda-discharge/">Deathloop</a></i> on its medium-power setting (“Performance”), and <i><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></i> on its all-out “Turbo” mode.</p>
<p>All four of those games worked mostly fine, but <i>DRG: Survivor</i> pushed the boundaries of Silent mode a bit when its levels got crowded with enemies and projectiles. Most games could automatically figure out a decent settings scheme for the Ally X. If a game offers AMD’s FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling, you should at least try it; it’s usually a big boon to a game running on this handheld.</p>
<p>Overall, the ROG Ally X was a device I didn't notice when I was using it, which is the best recommendation I can make. Perhaps I noticed that the 1080p screen was brighter, closer to the glass, and sharper than the LCD (original) Steam Deck. At handheld distance, the difference between 800p and 1080p isn't huge to me, but the difference between LCD and OLED is more so. (Of course, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">an OLED version of the Steam Deck</a> was released late last year.)</p>

            <p>Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus - the gorgeous 2.5D platformer with Metroidvania elements based on Japanese folklore - released earlier this year across PC and consoles. However, soon after its debut, its publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games faced "restructuring" at the company</a>, resulting in layoffs. (Eurogamer and Humble Games share a parent compamy, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>This had a knock-on effect for the game's developer Squid Shock. Soon after news broke about layoffs at Humble, Squid Shock assured its community it remained committed to Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, but the changes at the publisher could result in delays for updates, particularly on consoles.</p>
<p>"We are now in a difficult situation when it comes to updating the console ports, as both Porting and QA Support was tied into our deal with Humble," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus-console-updates-may-be-delayed-due-to-humble-layoffs-developer-warns">Squid Shock wrote in July</a>. "We are actively pursuing all available avenues to allow us to roll out updates to console versions, but we regret to say this may take some time to put in place."</p>

<p>Thankfully, a solution has evidently been found. Last night, Squid Shock shared an update on social media platform X, calling the recent ordeal a "long and arduous journey".</p>
<p>"The challenges we've faced over the past month were beyond anything we could have anticipated, leading to disruptions in our porting, QA, and console submission pipelines," it wrote. "But today, we're relieved and excited to tell you that we've overcome those obstacles. We're thrilled to announce that the patches for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus on Xbox X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch are now live!"</p>
<p>These patches will address a number of general issues across Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' console versions, including bug fixes and gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>"It's a testament to the dedication and resilience of our team that, despite everything, we've been able to bring these crucial updates to you," Squid Shock continued. "Our greatest hope is that these improvements bring you closer to the experience we always intended for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus. We want you to know how much your support means to us, and we're overjoyed to be able to continue this journey together.</p>
<p>"Thank you for standing by us through thick and thin."</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-final-release-before-restructuring-has-launched-a-patreon-in-these-uncertain-times">Squid Shock set up a Patreon to support Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a> "in these uncertain times". At this time, Squid Shock said whilst it did not fault the team's work, the changes at Humble "have meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support, which may put our studio's future at risk".</p>
<p>As for Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, I was rather enamoured with it when I gave the demo a go earlier this year. You can read more in my Wishlisted feature: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus-demo-reminded-me-of-the-sanctity-of-tea">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus' demo reminded me of the sanctity of tea</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
