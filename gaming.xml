<p>TechRaptor was given an exclusive sneak peek at four of the Environments that will be available in the full rulebook when it releases physically and digitally at the end of the month. We also had a chance to talk about Environments (among other things that will be saved for a later date) with Lead Designers <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b50b662-11ad-4fba-8903-ff76c59dea55" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/spenser-starke-is-bringing-cinematic-gming-to-candela-obscura-chapter-2" rel="nofollow">Spenser Starke</a> and Rowan Hall.</p>

<h2>Environments Help A GM Consider The World</h2>

<p>Environments are locations that a GM can put in play that will not only affect the story by posing potential challenges for the players to overcome, but also offer unique mechanical obstacles to engage in.</p>

<p>The four Environments that TechRaptor can exclusively reveal are the Cliffside Ascent, Local Tavern, Outpost Town, and Raging River. Each is a Tier 1 event, which means it's intended for a party of level 2-4. Set for a lower level of play we're able to see how each of these are able to impact the party, and how these can be scaled up.</p>

<p>Each Environment is comprises of the following features:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the Environment</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Tier and Style of Environment: </strong>Here we see both Traversal and Social giving you fast information for where you might want to include it</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Impulses: </strong>Describing the way that you could provoke your players with the Environment to help them more readily engage</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Difficulty: </strong>This indicates the average difficulty check that the area would have, the GM can then further scale this up or down based on the relative safety or danger of the character's actions</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Potential Adversaries:</strong> A list of creatures or monsters that a party might find while exploring that area</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Features: </strong>Key gameplay elements tied to the Environment, these can be related to social interactions, rules for how to overcome an obstacle, but also can be related to ways things like combat may change</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>"We like Environments because they allow you to create a stat block, but for a place" - Spenser Starke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting to talk with Starke and Hall they explained they wanted to create a way that you could have stats about a location, that were available for you next to Adversaries. In <em>Daggerheart</em>, as play moves back to the GM it's important that you're able to understand all of the moves you can make.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=3oE4lfMJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-environments-exclusive-page-spread.jpg?itok=kf9-RpNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Environments Enhance <em>Daggerheart </em>Combat</h2>

<p>Hall gave an example of how an Environment could be used "say you're taking your players to a graveyard, you know there's a big bad evil Necromancer raising a bunch of zombies, you've got maybe a horde statted up, but you also want to have hands reach up from graves and grab your players and restrain them. It could be a lot of work to stat up a bunch of zombies, but if you have an Environment you can make an Environment Action where on a certain trigger hands restrain your players"</p>

<p>In <em>Daggerheart</em>, the combat isn't linear in that every character and adversary has a turn in order before it all resets. There's a player's turn and a GM's turn. For the players, this promotes playing collaboratively to strike together, for the GM, that means when it's your turn, any of the Adversaries at your command can go at any time. So many abilities at any point in time can be difficult to track, letting an Environment clearly be part of your list of actions is simply helping the GM have less to manage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to pair down and streamline [combat], we're always looking for ways to give GMs all of the support that they need and also open enough doors that they might expand with their own narrative, their own choices, and have flexibility" - Rowan Hall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starke did highlight that Environments shouldn't be used everywhere "but if there's a place where you're like 'I can see how this environment itself really impacts the narrative, let me write down what this place is really about."</p>

<h2>An Environment Doesn't Have To Be A Place</h2>

<p>While the four that TechRaptor has been able to reveal were specifically places, Starke expanded that there were also Environments that it may not be "a particular place, it isn't like, an outpost but it is an Ambush. That can be placed anywhere, but it can give you the framing of what mechanically an Ambush might look like in <em>Daggerheart </em>for a scene you're interested in running."</p>

<p>When I asked what kinds of GM tools would be available for crafting their own Environments Hall paused for a moment before saying "One of my favorite parts of the book is a section where we go through how we build different adversary types and why we make the choices we do."</p>

<p>Describing it as 'popping open the hood' Hall continued to explain "We hope it's a conversation with the designers, the goal there was to make it as approachable as possible with as many examples as possible to people can refer to it almost like a recipe book. We have all different ways that people can approach that."</p>

<p>It's these kinds of behind the scenes looks and conversational understandings about why things are designed the way that they are that Starke and Hall are hoping it will make GMs crafting their own Environments possible.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Feven-more-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-and-updates-released%2F" rel="sponsored">has announced</a> a May 19th release date for its $299 RTX 5060 graphics card and the first laptops, which start at $1,099, that will feature it. The company says they’ll be available to buy from retail partners starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET.</p><p>At 3,840 CUDA cores, the RTX 5060 has nearly 800 fewer cores than the 5060 Ti Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">released last month</a> and is the most basic of the RTX 50-series. But like the Ti version, the 5060 has GDDR7 memory, supports DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and gets the latest ray tracing and tensor cores. The company says more games are being updated with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation before the 5060 launches, including <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans </em>on May 7th and <em>New World: Aeternum</em> on May 13th. </p><p>Whether the card is worth picking up, though, is another story. The RTX 5060 is limited to just 8GB of VRAM, and chances are good it’ll cost more than its suggested $299 retail price. Retailers started selling GPUs, including the other RTX 50-series cards, at a premium even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628332/amd-9070-xt-gpu-retailer-partner-scalping">before President Trump’s tariffs took hold</a>. And as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again"><em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister</a> noted recently, Trump’s removal of the de minimus exemption last week could also impact pricing via extra import taxes on shipments valued at or under $800.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rockstar have released a second trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It's one of those cinematic clip shows of scenes from the game, setting up the story and relationship between dual protagonists Jason and Lucia. It's horny and boring at the same time. Nope, there's still no word on a PC release, sorry. </p>

<p>In the video we see Jason "Do You Even Lift" Duval going to collect his partner in crime (and life) from her stint in prison. Once free, Lucia "Okay One More Butt Shot" Caminos fires many weapons, kicks people, and makes kissy faces at her criminal bae. This is all set to 1986 pop hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NnMl7NUmS8">Hot Together by the Pointer Sisters</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them," say Rockstar on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">the studio's website</a>, where they're finally sharing more about the game's story. "But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."</p>
<p>Other characters include conspiracy theorist pal Cal Hampton (basically Jack Black), bank robber Raul Bautista, gangster-to-musician Dre'Quan Priest, and two social media rappers known as Real Dimez. The developers have dumped a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/downloads/screenshots">ton of screenshots</a> of these characters and more.</p>
<p>The trailer follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">the game's recent delay</a>, which pushed the open world crime sim's release date back to May 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the film itself, the name “Thunderbolts” refers to a soccer team Yelena (Florence Pugh) was part of as a child, which her father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), uses as a placeholder name for their team of misfit toys. At the very end, the group is rebranded as the “New Avengers,” officially relaunching the superhero team after its previous lineup disbanded following the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) leads the team, which makes sense considering he’s the only person who was around as part of the initial group when Thanos was destroying half the known universe, but as seen in the post-credits scene, not every Avengers alumnus is thrilled by this development. Captain America (Anthony Mackie) is suing the group for copyright infringement after he was shown to be in talks to lead a new team under the Avengers banner in <em>Brave New World</em>. So it seems like there will be some tension between the group and other heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><em>Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></span><em> </em>next year.</p><p>Once the group is deemed the New Avengers, the end credits sequence reveals the film’s new, true title: <em>The New Avengers</em>. It’s a clever gimmick that finally contextualizes the asterisk in the movie’s original title. However, it wasn’t enough for Marvel to introduce a New Avengers team through the back door of what appeared to be more of a B-plot film about some of the outcasts of the MCU; the company is also making this a marketing beat and spoiling the movie after one weekend. This isn’t just sequestered into trailers or social media videos; real-world billboards for the film are being updated for people to stumble upon out in the wild.</p><p>I’m torn because, as a marketing campaign, it’s pretty great. From the outside, <em>Thunderbolts* </em>was already fighting an uphill battle as a team-up movie of mostly side heroes in a franchise that no longer has the same cultural cache it once did. So it’s fun to see the movie rebranded as something more seemingly central to the overall MCU as a cheeky acknowledgement of the “oh, you thought you could skip this one?” feeling that has followed it. But also, this movie is only days old, and Marvel is using its massive platform to just spoil it outright for anyone who didn’t have the time or cash to swing by the theater on opening weekend. I’m staunchly against a company trying to control the narrative and tell people not to talk about something they paid money to see (within reason), but I feel even weirder about Marvel making that executive decision collectively for its audience.</p><p>Spoiler culture has gotten out of hand, and people’s almost phobia-like aversion to even pretty basic narrative details has made it almost impossible to talk about media without a comical amount of self-policing in public spaces. But I don’t know if Marvel is the company to take a big, subversive swing on the matter just 72 hours after a movie launched. Maybe there’s something to be said about how the “Thanos demands your silence” nonsense was a trailblazer and that other companies have followed suit in the years since. Maybe <em>Thunderbolts* </em>could be a pivot point that encourages people to stop taking spoiler culture so seriously. But maybe it could have waited one more week or so. Some of us were busy last weekend, Kevin Feige. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After last week revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6's delay to May 2026</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">Rockstar has today released the second trailer</a> for its highly-anticipated open world game. 
</p>
<p>
Much of the new footage focuses on co-protagonist Jason Duval, glimpsed in Rockstar's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> trailer alongside his partner in crime Lucia. Today's trailer expands on his life, the couple's relationship, and introduces a few more faces from the game's cast. 
</p><p>

Alongside the trailer, Rockstar has also released a brief synopsis of the game's plot: "Set in Vice City, Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida - forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."

</p><p>
Let's dive in.
</p>

<p>The trailer opens with a look at this picturesque seafront area - vastly different to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s Los Santos.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's here we meet Brian Heder, who Rockstar desrcibes as a "classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling". He owns the property where Jason's living, rent-free, in exchange for help with his schemes.
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Brian's vaguely upset that Jason is living easy, when he should be off collecting rent from Brian's other, paying tenants. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's line here, "love you, Jason" is the first time his name has actually been confirmed - previously we just knew the name of his partner, Lucia. Jason's name now gets said a bunch more times in the next 30 seconds, just so you definitely know what it is.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Indeed, Jason is shown to be something of a popular guy around these parts. Jason doesn't seem too bothered.
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As you'd expect, rent collection requires a bit of convincing from some folk. Here, Jason slaps a weed store owner and helps himself to the money from the cash register.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I can hear the GTA 6 mapping enthusiasts scribbling notes from here. We're headed along the freeway with a left turn to Vice City airport and Ambrosia, a location beyond the city fans have suspected may represent Orlando. Straight ahead lies Vice City's Downtown area. To the right is the city's Southside, and then Peacock Bay. Bumper stickers on the car in front read "MyWays" and "#Unbuckled".
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Yep, Jason is definitely buff.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But he also likes beer! His T-shirt here reads Leonida Marine Center, reflecting his former service. The slogan reads "We support all marine life!", while the design sports a cigar-smoking eagle brandishing a gun with each wing. You can also buy lottery tickets for a prize draw declaring "a new billionaire every week!" And finally - note the cat on the right. Cats in GTA 6 confirmed. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's off somewhere - past cops pushing people around - to the jail we saw Lucia inside during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Grand Theft Auto 6's first trailer</a>. "I'm here for Lucia Caminos," Jason says. "She's supposed to be getting out." The prison guard recognises Jason, establishing that he has visited Lucia often. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And here Lucia is, GTA 6's other main character. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's safe to say Lucia and Jason have some things to catch up on. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Is this a flashback, or does Lucia get straight back to work? Masked, we see her threatening two men in suits. Jason is involved too.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"To new beginnings," Jason says, finally cracking open that beer with Lucia. (They're drinking a brand of cerveza named "Dayho".) The pair reminisce at sunset, seemingly remembering an occasion where one of them broke someone's nose. 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Contrast that talk of new beginnings and bright sunset with two nighttime shots of reality. Back at Brian's, Jason helps load something (presumably drugs) onto a small plane. Meanwhile, Lucia sports a fluorescent jacket picking up litter by the side of the road.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Trust me, this place is just a start for us," Lucia tells Jason, who looks unsure. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Ring the bells!" shouts Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, in a seedy-looking bar where the pair do shots. Cut to Lucia, now in a gold sequined dress, at a far more upmarket establishment, showing off her outfit to Jason.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"If we're doing this, we do it right," says Jason, as we see our characters holding hands, partners in... crime? A new life? Cut to Jason and Lucia, presumably later that night, dancing in a club. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In another scene, Jason and what looks to be new character Dre'quan Priest approach a contact. "Yo D, this fool a Fed?" the contact asks. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unclear what happens next, but these gentlemen do not look happy. Is this the easy score that goes wrong? Jason and Lucia are shown escaping from a window, as Brian remarks that their name and address are now known. But by who?
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
We're introduced to a cop character, prowling through a building toting a gun. "Us cops, we gotta protect each other," he tells someone in a boiler suit, presumably undercover.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
A succession of quick shots shows, among other things, Jason shoving someone into a car while Lucia fights in a kickboxing match. "You and me Lu, we got this," says Jason. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Cut to a police convoy exploding after someone fires a grenade launcher. It's safe to say they have not got this as much as they expect. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
More quick shots, including someone (Lucia?) wrestling someone else on the open cargo doors of a taxiing plane, a car chase where someone steals an ATM machine that was mentioned in an earlier leak, and various shots of people dancing/showing that Vice City is aptly named. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In the trailer's final sequence, Jason sits on the couch watching a commercial for Phil's Ammu-Nation, beer bottles and a fake PS5 in view. Lucia's just home from her litter picking job (her vest sports the letters LDC, presumably Leonida Department of Corrections). 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But there's no time to sleep. Jason's on a jetski! A motorboat shooting at a helicopter! A motorbike! 
</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">
<figure>

</figure>
<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Hey, if you got friends can you hook me up please?!" shouts Cal - a question hopefully the audience is also now saying of GTA 6, before we're reminded that the game is still over a year away. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that's it - what did you think?</p>
<p>
Accompanying the trailer, Rockstar has today also released new information further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">detailing GTA 6's large cast of charaters and some of the various regions you'll visit around Vice City and beyond</a>.

			<p>Getting Cyberpunk 2077 to run on Nintendo Switch 2 did not require a gigantic effort, although getting it to play well was among the challenges CD Projekt Red had to face during the port's development.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>, CD Projekt Red SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that the team managed to get the game running on Nintendo Switch 2 fairly quickly and without a gigantic effort. However, bigger challenges were to ensure the game would play well, use some of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features, and that it suited the handheld format. With the game's disastrous launch on previous generation consoles in mind, CDPR wanted to ensure the game played well on the system, even with some visual compromises that, according to Rosner, don't impact the game's artistic vision. In this regard, the CDPR SVP of Business feels the team achieved their goal of having a big AAA RPG on the go playable from start to finish without making any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch2-surpass-ps4-graphics/">significant compromises</a>.</p>
<p>The attention CD Projekt Red placed on the Nintendo Switch 2 release of Cyberpunk 2077 and the console's audience is well highlighted by the fact that the retail edition will include the full game on the cartridge and won't require any additional download. The team made this decision based on their experience with The Witcher 3 on the original Switch, which proved how important physical editions are for the Nintendo audience, and, as such, putting the entire game on the cartridge to offer a plug-and-play experience was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console debuts worldwide, with a few exceptions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2340520/view/535474378243048018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on PC via Steam Early Access on May 21st, and yes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">unlike&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, that's May 21st this year, not next.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, you'll be building your dream farmhouse, all while shapeshifting into various yokai forms in order to make exploration and day-to-day life easier. Think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spirittea" rel="nofollow"><em>Spirittea</em></a>, but where you get to transform into the creatures, and you're not a million miles away.</p>

Together with your sister Kon, you'll build a life among these mythical beings.</p>

<p>Forms you can shapeshift into over the course of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>include the Crow Tengu, which grants you flight, as well as the water-dwelling Slime and the farmland-tending Boar.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a life sim like this, you can grow and tend to crops, raise livestock, and build your homestead, kitting it out with custom-crafted furniture to add that all-important personal touch. Of course, you can also cook meals from the ingredients you grow and source from the local area.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>also features a romance system, with "a variety of romanceable partners" available, each of whom has "their own unique personalities and heartwarming stories". The game's "extraordinary" villagers will have a range of quests for you to complete as well.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 21st.

Again, how reflective that is of the finished game remains to be seen, but Rockstar Games has certainly earned itself the benefit of the doubt in many quarters over the years, especially between <em>GTA V </em>and <em>Red Dead Redemption VI</em>.

Here's the official blurb, alongside brand new screenshots.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto VI Characters</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Jason Duval</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Lucia Caminos</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes. A life with Jason could be her way out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Cal Hampton</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What if everything on the internet was true? Jason’s friend and a fellow associate of Brian’s, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The psychopaths are in charge. Get used to it. Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Cal Hampton Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Boobie Ike</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all about heart — the Jack of Hearts. Boobie is a local Vice City legend — and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio — Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Top quality cuts. Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in — now they just need a hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Boobie Ike Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Dre'Quan Priest</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Only Raw... Records. Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're with the label now. Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Dre'Quan Priest Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Real Dimez</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Viral videos. Viral hooks. Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school — girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One hit away from fame. An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, they’re signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Real Dimez Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Raul Bautista</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Experience counts. Confidence, charm, and cunning — Raul’s a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A professional adapts. Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Raul Bautista Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Brian Heder</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset. Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looks like a Leonida beach bum — moves like a great white shark. Brian’s letting Jason live rent-free at one of his properties — so long as he helps with local shakedowns, and stops by for Lori’s sangria once in a while.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Brian Heder Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar also released information and screenshots on the explorable places in the state of Leonida, GTA 6's take on Florida.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto VI cities, places, and environments</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Vice City</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything in Excess. We're a long way from the '80s, but Vice City is still the sun and fun capital of America.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city. Each neighborhood has something to offer, from the pastel art deco hotels and bright white sands of Ocean Beach, to the bustling panaderías of Little Cuba and the bootleg brands of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, out to the VC Port, the cruise ship capital of the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Leonida Keys</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gateway to Paradise. The dress code is casual, the bars are loaded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Life in this tropical archipelago isn’t flashy but it’s easy. Get your buzz on and pull up a deck chair but look out — you are right on the doorstep of some of the most beautiful and dangerous waters in all of America.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Leonida Keys Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Grassrivers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to the Wetlands. The untamable jewel of Leonida’s crown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You never know what lies beneath the surface of this primordial expanse.

This is Leonida’s forgotten coast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheap motels, shut-down attractions, and empty strip malls won’t bring the tourists back, but there’s a new economy in this once-popular vacation spot. It’s fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks. Jump on a dirt bike and hold onto your wallet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Port Gellhorn Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Ambrosia</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping Leonida Sweet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is the gaming industry's most anticipated game, but after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">last Friday's news that it would be delayed into May of next year</a>, it seemed like it would be a while before we saw any new details about the game. Today, Rockstar decided to surprise the internet once more, but with good news this time: a second trailer. You can check it out below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This trailer spends a bit more time introducing the audience to Jason Duval, the game's male protagonist, by giving us a glimpse into his day to day life. It seems to be as much about showing off the new and improved Vice City, as Jason lifts weights on the beach, cruises down the highway, and avoids police at night. Eventually, he picks up Lucia Caminos, the other protagonist, from prison, and the game wastes no time showing how head over heels they are for each other. It's almost an even split between action shots and intimate romance, further suggesting that GTA VI's story will have a Bonnie and Clyde vibe.</p>

<p>Additionally, developer Rockstar has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">updated its website</a> to include more information and images, including screenshots, new characters, and more. Here's the new synopsis of the game's plot, revealing more of the story's stakes:</p>

<p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is over a year away, giving ravenous fans plenty of time to dissect this new look at the game and mine it for more information. Regardless, we can't wait for May 26 of next year.

            <p>Rockstar has begun lifting the lid on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">new trailer today</a> that gives a deeper look at its pair of protagonists and the setting of Leonida.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">game's website</a> has also been updated to show off its cast of characters and locations - Vice City, and beyond.</p>
<p>Judging by its sexy trailer, it looks like GTA 6 is set to be something of a love story, but there's a strong music industry theme too.</p>

<p>First up, our protagonists are Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. The hunky Jason is a former army soldier turned drug runner, while Lucia is fresh out of Leonida Penitentiary, having previously lived in Liberty City with her family.</p>
<p>Both characters seem to be seeking a way out of their current lives, leading to the events of GTA 6.</p>

</figure>
<p>Next up is Jason's friend Cal Hampton described as living "at the low tide of America and happy there". He appears to be something of a lovable fool.</p>
<p>Cal is also an associate of Brian Heder, a drug runner "from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys" who owns a boat yard with his third wife, Lori. Brian is allowing Jason to live rent-free at one of his properties, as long as he helps out with some jobs. I imagine it's a slippery slope for Jason, setting up his meeting with Lucia.</p>

<p>Then there are the music industry characters. Boobie Ike is a local legend of Vice City, owning a recording studio, a strip club, and real estate as part of a grand empire. "The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all," he says.</p>
<p>Boobie has partnered with aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan Priest for the Only Raw Records label. Dre'Quan is "more of a hustler than a gangster", though the music industry has always been his goal.</p>

<figcaption>Boobie and Dre'Quan | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Only Raw Records has signed a pair of troublesome female rappers, Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez. They are "girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence".</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The GTA games have always been recognised for their brilliant soundtracks - shout out to Vice City's classic 80s tracks - but I'm particularly excited to see the developers lampoon the current state of the music industry and its reliance on social media. We already saw elements of that in the first trailer.</p>
<p>The last character introduced is Raul Bautista, a "seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent". No guesses for which pair of desperate anti-heroes he's about to hire.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Raul Bautista | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rockstar has also hinted at some of the locations we'll be exploring in GTA 6.</p>
<p>Vice City - a spoof of Miami - is of course at the core of Leonida, representing the "glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city". It contains the white sands of Ocean Beach, the "bustling panaderías" of Little Cuba, the "bootleg brands" of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The glamour of Vice City | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further out are the Leonida Keys, where life "isn't flashy but it's easy" - presumably this is where Jason starts out. Grassrivers are the "untamable jewel of Leonida's crown", known for their gators and other "weirder discoveries".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The thrills of Leonida Keys | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Port Gellhorn is full of cheap motels and shut-down attractions, presumably a spin on Florida's notorious theme parks and tourist areas. Ambrosia is the "heart of Leonida" where "American industry and old school values still reign supreme" - it includes a sugar refinery offering jobs and a dominating biker gang.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Nighttime in Port Gellhorn | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The final location is Mount Kalaga National Park, a national landmark on the state's northern border full of hunting and fishing spots, off-road trails, and hillbilly mystics.</p>
<p>How big will GTA 6's map end up? We don't know yet, but judging by these locations it's going to be expansive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 was recently delayed</a> from later this year, and will now be released on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>This new trailer is the latest look at the game since the previous trailer, released in December 2023. Hopefully it won't be such a long wait for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-soundtrack-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the blink of an eye, <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-nathan-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has gone from a cool-looking RPG folks wishlisted after the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase to the talk of the town, with a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-live-action-film-story-kitchen-sandfall-interactive-1236291356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action film adaptation</a> already in the works. Its release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-shadow-drop-actually-benefitted-the-game-by-drawing-attention-to-quality-rpgs-that-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coincided with <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em> remaster</a>, making it a tough time for another game to hold its ground. We <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke highly of its early goings on the podcast</a>, and I gave it a thumbs up in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, though I’m still wrapping my head around the full RPG spectacle of its final act biting off a bit more than it could chew for my liking.</p><p>While a not-insignificant portion of the internet is embroiled in debates over whether <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s runaway success stems from its refreshing flavor of turn-based RPG mechanics, conveniently overlooking the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/expedition-33-unique-turn-based-combat-final-fantasy-lost-odyssey-yakuza-dragon-quest-baldurs-gate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stellar lineup of similar RPGs</a> we’ve been spoiled with lately, or gaming’s latest case of recency bias, one thing is indisputable: <a href="https://lnk.to/clair-obscur-expedition-33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its soundtrack slaps</a>. I spoke with composer Lorien Testard about how he went from making tunes once a week on Soundcloud to landing his first game project.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><p>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2>Getting started</h2><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> What was the process like getting approached by director Guillaume Broche to collaborate with Sandfall Interactive on <em>Clair Obscur</em> five years ago?</p><p><strong>Lorien Testard:&nbsp; </strong>Usually, I write one song a week, so it was a really long process for me. After one year [of posting songs], Guillaume found me on a web forum about indie games. He listened to some song off my SoundCloud, and he really liked what he heard, and he loved my music. So he asked me to do the job for <em>Expedition 33</em>.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> What details were you given about the game to help guide your approach to crafting music that complements its narrative and setting?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I was really free. I created what I wanted and what I liked. But we had the same tastes on the video game — the melancholia and the nostalgia we wanted to put into the soundtrack, a sensitivity of sadness and a lifting up [element too].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Is there a particular emotion or atmosphere you strived to convey through the music?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It depends on which la ville (town) you are in. When you are in the Gestral village or just at the start, it’s not the same atmosphere. It was like seeing each part of the game and thinking, “What will be the best fit?” When you were in the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ms4Mmb9kY4E?si=SWwtUt7EkQtd4Hyn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Gublu”</a>, we had a lot of submarine sounds and some crazy ideas for the water and aquatic stuff. But after, in <a href="https://youtu.be/2tl5ekssCZg?si=NOk3FQY_FAmIUSom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Sciel”</a>, for example, we have more beautiful, poetic, dense, soft music to help describe the environment.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sandfall Interactive</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> I <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/composing-the-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read</a> that you alternated between your home studio and working with the Curieux <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FIMsKKvBRM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orchestra</a> at the Midilive Studios in Paris while making the game’s soundtrack. Did you use any unique instruments or production techniques that worked best in one setting over the other?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I was working for five years in my own studio, and then we chose a section of tracks and we did a little orchestra session. It’s not like I did a back-and-forth with the orchestra. It was only three days at the end of the project, so [the soundtrack] was really made at my own place. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And, yeah, you have a lot of musical techniques. I love to find my sound on the soundtrack. For example, I really like to layer the piano sound of the game. Sometimes, it's like 12 different pianos to do the sound of one track. I really love this concept of taking the part I like in the virtual instrumental piano and layering it with the other part I like to have a distinct sound for a piano track.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Finding sound through inspirations&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>IC: </strong>With <em>Clair Obscur</em> being your first contracted game, how did you manage the stress while stepping into the role of sonic leader for the project? Did you face any creative blocks or challenges, and how did you work through them?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>Honestly, at the start, we're like, we are three [songs] at the start. Then six. Then 10. So I didn't feel any pressure at all, because it was a thread on Discord, and we did the game and the soundtrack together at the start. And then we hired and grew bigger. From the beginning, I was here to write, so I didn't feel like “It's now my job.” It was a dream project to be with your friends and create music from the start.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were there specific moments during the process where inspiration struck you?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> It's happened often. Every song has a particular story that I really love. So for each song, I can say there’s a story.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>One song that struck me was the “<a href="https://youtu.be/sN91jLQJjcQ?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirene</a>” theme. It reminded me a lot of the music I’d hear in <em>Nier Automata</em> or <em>Nier Replicant</em>, where it goes into a <a href="https://youtu.be/CqzlvuJs9-4?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballet kind of playfulness</a>. But it’d also have <a href="https://youtu.be/RRCK_Co8c9c?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moodier</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/1KiFMEj7DtQ?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darker undertones</a> to it with a boss fight that kicked my ass.</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> With “Sirene,” I wrote it early in the project, and I wrote the guitar part. So all is coming from the guitar. The main idea and concept for “Sirene” was the softness of the whole environment and the bosses. Then I added a low recorder to make the wind and environment like a circle.&nbsp;</p><p>In the level, you have the boss right at the start. You see it, and you have to do the whole level to be in front of her. So across the entire level, we wanted this voice that the player can hear everywhere. So we had the voice of Alice [Duport-Percier], the singer of the game, and the three elements together, and we created the track. Guitar first, then the low recorder, and then the voice everywhere in the level.</p><figure><figcaption>Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier cooking in the recording studio. <span></span><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> How did your approach to composing evolve over the five years you spent working on the game?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I knew pretty early the scope of the universe, the level, and the script, so I made my dream soundtrack. For example, I would take a level and would want to write three environment tracks, two battle themes, and one boss theme. I do that for the whole game and — one by one — I’d write the track for five years until the end.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Clair Obscur</em> proudly draws inspiration from iconic RPGs like <em>Lost Odyssey</em> and <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, while adding its unique twist to the genre. What gaming soundtracks from childhood shaped your musical taste, and how did those influences come through in the tracks you created for the game?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I tried not to be influenced by other soundtracks. I was focused on my music for five years. But for sure, I have a lot of soundtracks I love from before. I love the music of Joe Hisaishi from Studio Ghibli. I listened to him often when I was younger. And I love <em>Zelda </em>music. I’m really a fan of <em>Zelda</em>'s sound and universe. So maybe we can feel my past taste in my music now. I also listen to a lot of French songs and French artists, so we can feel it too in the soundtrack.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Who were some of those French artists?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bashung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alain Bashung</a>.</p><h2>Picking favorites and getting Ben Starr to sing</h2><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Clair Obscur</em>’s soundtrack clocks out at a whopping 8 hours plus, with 154 tracks, some of which are remixes/permutations of a previous theme. Is there any specific piece of music from the game that stands out as a personal favorite, or one you're especially proud of?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It's really hard to tell my favorite soundtrack, but I could give a story of the most challenging. I wrote three songs —“<a href="https://youtu.be/-i_nT9d-mK8?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à peindre</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/3kMbTzomh94?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à t'aimer</a>,” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/10m7CzhQrFs?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à rêver</a>”— three eleven-minute tracks that were important for a confrontation in the game. They’re really important songs, and I spent a lot of time writing them with Victor Borba and Duport-Percier. It was challenging to create, and it took me the most time of the whole project.&nbsp;</p><p>When you discover it in-game, the cutscene and all the transition between the songs happens. It creates so much emotion to feel that. I have seen some reactions of players when they discover that’s in-game. It's insane to see that it works so well, because you have silence, and then you have something that happens, and the track is coming, and it's so powerful. I really love it.</p><p>And “<a href="https://youtu.be/EWEK2-6whZI?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aux Lendemains non Ecrits</a>,” the one before the end. It’s a favorite song of my father. I shared the eight hour soundtrack with my father. He listened to every song and said to me, “I really love the lyrics of this song,” and I think about it too. I’m proud of this lyric. It’s authentic and really simple. But for me, it worked well for where the song is put. In English, it’s “To Unwritten Tomorrows” and the song plays at a special place.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sandfall Interactive</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Even with my limited understanding of music, I noticed that <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s soundtrack features a leitmotif — a catchy “Dim dim dam dada” melody — in Lumière’s theme, performed by vocalist Duport-Percier. Where did the inspiration for this earworm of a tune come from?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqizXvvWnmM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lumière</a>” was one of the first tracks I wrote for the project. I wrote it on the guitar first and I really love the leitmotif of the song, because we had an internal playtest of the game, and we had a first draft of Lumière and Gustave walking on the roof of the city, and we put the credits of everyone who worked on the game. When I saw it, I knew it was the perfect atmosphere for “Lumière.” When I found that I really liked it, I decided to [use it] for the whole part of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we have the melody in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbPkvqRiGg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gustave</a>” because it’s his city, it's like his own city, and he cares about those who came before and those who come after. So, we find this motif in his team, and we find it often in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>When you come back to Lumière, it's not the same. So the song could not be the same after what happened. But in the camp, we have some variation to remember where they came from and where they must go. You always have the Paintress in front of you, so the melody is really powerful to give this feeling of “My home is at my back and I have to think of it and protect it, but I have to move toward the adventure in front of me.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are there other recurring themes or motifs within <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s music that carry deeper, symbolic significance?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> The main motif of the game is “Alicia.”We find this melodic motif in a lot of songs. I think “Alicia” is the most used theme in battle, and then we have “Lumière.” For example, when you had the music of the Gommage, it plays. It’s the music of Sophie when she turns to dust. And I use it for another place in the game, but it’s become the theme of Sophie.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lorien Testard, Alice Duport-Percier - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Alicia (Orchestral)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNu5UvsRNI8?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>As is tradition in RPGs, each party member in <em>Clair Obscur</em> has their unique musical theme. How would you describe these character themes, and what approach did you take to give each one its own distinct sonic identity?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It's so funny to do that. Honestly, I see that like a gift. I've played so many games, so I know when you write a theme for a character, it's for the life of a character. So it's really important that I give all my love to do that. I spent a lot of time looking at the concept art and trying to feel the mood and the whole soul of the characters.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, “Gustave” was written really late in the production. We can think [of it as] one of the first songs, but “Gustave” was written six months ago. It's late because, at first, I thought “Lumière” would be the “Gustave” theme. But one day, I found Gustave's piano melody, and I knew it was his, so we put it in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>How about Maelle’s theme?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>Maelle’s theme was special. It's the last theme on the soundtrack, and I put it in last for a good reason. You understand why, but seeing the song take life was special because it's the last song we recorded with the orchestra. We filmed the session with a dancer, and when I saw the dance with the whole song we recorded with a beautiful voice in French and the full orchestra, I knew it was like my farewell to Maelle. It was emotional for me to see it end. I could not have ended up happier with Alice and Victor’s help.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Until Next Life" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9P0Qgi4wAM?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>We’ve talked about collaborating with incredible vocalists like <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>’s Borba and mezzo-soprano Axelle Verner, but the score also saw gaming’s babygirl, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Starr</a>, join in too. I’ve <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/expedition-33-composer-music-ben-starr-verso-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard </a>Ben’s involvement might have come after a couple of beers, prompting him to lend his vocal talents to Verso and its soundtrack. Would you mind recounting how Starr’s musical debut came to be?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> It was a chaotic good proposition at Christmas. I wrote the song “<a href="https://youtu.be/a9P0Qgi4wAM?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Next Life</a>” a year before meeting Ben Starr. The song is about Verso and what happened in his life. I told Broche it would be cool to have Verso’s voice actor singing it. We forgot about it, and then, one Christmas, I met Starr, and we shared a clip of the orchestration to show what we did. I remember saying, “Yeah, let’s go. I really want to do ‘Until Next Life’ with you. Would you like to try to sing?” He said yes, and the next morning, we recorded together.

The new trailer is — like the first — pretty heavily focused on setting up the characters and world, without much in the way of gameplay (though the developer does call it “the biggest, most immersive evolution of the series yet”).</p><p>But we do have a few more details about the story.

		<p>Given that the game has recently been delayed no one was expecting <del>the Spanish Inquisition</del> a second official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, but here it is!</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, and an unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>The new trailer names that male counterpart, he’s called Jason, and seems to be working as a handyman. After that its exactly what you would expect from a GTA game: Car chases, gun fights, boats, planes, and a bit of sexy stuff on the side. It’s all sound tracked by the brilliant “Hot Together” by the Pointer Sisters, a nod to the relationship between Jason and Lucia.</p>
<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>

<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>
<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games has just dropped the second Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. This one is heavily centered on Jason Duval, whereas the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trailer from December 2023</a> was arguably focused more on Lucia Caminos. We see her again, too, and it's clear the two are very much meant to be GTA's version of Bonnie and Clyde - two robbers very much in love. As for the rest, it's classic GTA to its finest - car chases, explosions, and larger-than-life characters briefly introduced to the fans.</p>
<p>The brief YouTube description of the video says:</p>
<p><em>Vice City, USA.</em></p>
<p><em>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</em></p>

<p>Rockstar Games has also launched the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Grand Theft Auto VI website</a>, which has already crashed due to excessive load. Thankfully, the developer also sent the press a copy of the first details on the game's characters and locations, as well as a boatload of new images.</p>

<p><em>Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. </em><em>Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new. Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out, but right now, it's hard to tell.</em></p>
<p><em>Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</em></p>
<p><em>More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands. A life with Jason could be her way out. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes.</em></p>

<p>Vice City is described as offering something different in each neighborhood: Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, Tisha-Wocka, and VC Port. There's also the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the 'primordial expanse' of the Grassrivers, the forgotten coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and the wild country of Mount Kalaga.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to May 26, 2026. We still have a year and 20 days of wait left.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-released-following-delay.1182084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released a second&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer just a few days after announcing that the game would, in fact, no longer make its intended release window of fall 2025.</p>

<p>Last week, Rockstar announced that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">on May 26th next year</a>, acknowledging that the date is "later than [fans] expected" but reaffirming its desire to "try and exceed [players'] expectations" with the game.</p>

<p>Now, the developer has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer in which we get a closer look at the lives of protagonists Jason and Lucia, although the trailer still doesn't contain any actual "on-the-ground" gameplay, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=jbwGECVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=lZTJt_Bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer is here, but it doesn't say much about the game's gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we're reacquainted with our two main characters, both of whom were first introduced as part of the original&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em><em>VI&nbsp;</em>trailer all the way back in December 2023 (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">yes, it really has been that long</a>).</p>

<p>At the outset of the trailer, we see Lucia getting out of prison, with Jason at the gates to greet her. What follows is a fairly typical montage of&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-style debauchery, with heists, partying, and over-the-top action setpieces all playing out against a backdrop of 80s music.</p>

<p>Over the course of the trailer, we hear Zenglen's "Child Support", Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight", Tammy Wynette's "Talkin' to Myself Again", and the Pointer Sisters' "Hot Together", all of which will presumably be on&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>'s soundtrack alongside Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road" from the debut trailer.</p>




<p>We also get to meet a number of the characters who will populate&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>'s fictional state of Leonida, and it looks like everyone's favorite gun-toting maniac Phil Cassidy will be making a return from his&nbsp;<em>GTA: Vice City&nbsp;</em>glory days, too.</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26th, 2026. You can find lots more info about the game, including details about its characters and story, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>

Simply not showing footage gets the entire industry talking. So, it’s something of a (fantastic) surprise that a brand new trailer should appear in the wake of the game’s delay into next year.</p><p>Originally intended to release this fall, with multiple games changing their launch plans to try to avoid it, Rockstar said the game needs another six months development time to be up to the standard it wants. Hence, the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p>Those who were disappointed, or even worried about the state of the game, should have their mind put slightly at ease by the new trailer. It’s definitively a <em>GTA </em>game, with no big surprises or twists, but rather a bunch of Miami-like vibes and a lot of butts.</p><p>The return to Vice City looks stunning, although it’s not entirely clear from the trailer what’s in-game and what’s cutscene, albeit that it’ll all be made in the same engine.</p><p>The official description for the new trailer reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida—forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t expect to see any more of the game for a good long while now. Rockstar will likely go back into its bunker and get on with completing the game, not worrying itself about producing any more ads. The game’s going to sell a billionty-million copies either way, if only it gets finished.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
