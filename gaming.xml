            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A year ago Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed that Microsoft was planning to launch a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">new Xbox mobile web store</a> in July 2024. That never happened. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">I’ve been wondering</a> what the hold up has been over the past year, and it seems we might have an answer: Apple.</p><p>Microsoft filed an amicus brief late on Tuesday, in support of Epic Games’ ongoing fight with Apple’s control over the App Store. The brief takes issue with Apple’s attempt to overturn the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">injunction that allows</a> Epic and other developers to freely advertise alternative payment methods in their apps, and not have to pay Apple additional fees for purchases made outside of apps.</p><p>It’s a key ruling that has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">allowed <em>Fortnite </em>to return to the App Store in the US</a>, complete with the ability for Epic Games to link out to its own payment system inside the game. Microsoft has wanted to offer a similar experience for its Xbox mobile store, but it says its solution “has been stymied by Apple.” Here’s how Microsoft explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</p></blockquote></div><p>The court ruling makes it possible for Microsoft to now launch its Xbox mobile store, but it’s clear that the software giant also wants to ensure Apple’s appeal against the ruling isn’t successful. If Microsoft did launch its Xbox mobile store and then Apple won a temporary stay, it may have to pull that store pending the appeal process.</p><p>Microsoft even notes in its filing that “Apple makes no argument that the technical or policy changes cannot be undone,” so it’s urging the ruling to be enforced pending Apple’s appeal. “Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.”</p><p>The court ruling also impacts Microsoft’s main Xbox mobile app. “Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices,” says Microsoft in its filing. “Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility.”</p><p>Microsoft started rolling out the ability to purchase games and DLC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649958/xbox-purchase-games-mobile-app-launch">inside the Xbox mobile app last month</a>, but it had to remove the remote play option to adhere to Apple’s App Store policies. You can’t currently buy an Xbox game in the Xbox mobile app on iOS and then stream it inside that same app. You have to manually navigate to the Xbox Cloud Gaming mobile website on a browser to get access to cloud gaming.</p><p>Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">also announced plans</a> to let players purchase and play games within the Xbox app on Android in October, just days after a court ruled that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">Google must crack open</a> Android to third-party app stores. The feature was supposed to arrive in November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games">but Bond then blamed</a> a “temporary administrative stay” for holding it back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I’m sad to say it, but Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny has not aged well. I remember being blown away when I originally played the game on my humble PS2 back in the day. The smooth and silky combat, the responsive controls, the larger-than-life characters, and visuals that seemed photorealistic at the time. Indeed, I remember thinking as I hacked apart my umpteenth demonic foe, “How can video game graphics possibly get better any than this?” Well, they did. And action-adventure games got a lot better too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - New Features Introduction" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vjcXB110vE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who never played Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny – perhaps you weren’t even born at the time? – allow me to give you the notes. This is a third-person action-adventure game and, in some ways, provides the original blueprint for so many of the action games we love today. Set in medieval Japan, you play as Jubei Yagya, a dashingly handsome samurai who is on a quest of vengeance. You see, Jubei’s entire village and clan were hacked to pieces by the villainous Nobunaga Oda. This real-life daimyō from the Sengoku period of Japan is cast here as a demonic warlord, one who will stop at nothing to crush Japan beneath his clawed fist. What follows is lots of hacking, slashing, boss fights, and puzzle solving, as Jubei and his Ninja pals seek to save the day.</p>



<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon starting up the game is that there is no independent camera operated by the player to see their surroundings here. Indeed, the game is strictly played from fixed-camera angles, just like the Resident Evil games that proceeded it. Frankly, I hated the restricted viewpoints back then and I hate them even more now. It’s just so easy to get lost and turned around, going back on yourself all the time, particularly when the direction controls are briefly reversed upon entering a new screen. Combat is clunky and messy as a result. It’s hard to gauge the distance of attacks and to even manage to hit the hideous beast stood right in front of you; all this serves to undermine the precision that’s required to successfully parry and counterattack.</p>

<p>This, of course, was one of the big innovations of Onimusha 2. Rather than the button-mashing madness of Dante in Devil May Cry, Jubei was intended to be a far more patient and thoughtful combatant, waiting for just the right moment to knock aside the blow from an undead samurai before following up with a potent combo or two. At the time, this gameplay innovation was spectacular. And now? Well, it’s the exact same video game combat you’ve been undertaking for the last few decades, only not as refined. Sure, the combat might now be moving along at a punchy 60fps, but it’s still pretty simplistic, so unless you have particularly fond memories of playing the game in the early noughties, you’re hardly going to be blown away. In fact, you might just wonder what all the fuss what about.</p>

<p>There’s been some other tweaks made for a modern audience, such as the ability to switch between weapons with the tap of a button, or – thank Capcom – being able to use a 360-degree analogue control rather than the awful classic tank controls. A new Hell mode is there for those who want an extreme challenge, and various minigames and costumes are unlocked from the off as well. Visually things have been sharpened up, but this is simply an HD polish of the PS2 graphics. They’re good for the era, but there’s none of the substantial visual upgrade that accompanied the recent remake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. Though the new digital soundtrack of the original tracks is a lovely nostalgic listen for the old lugholes.</p>
<p>As a game to play in 2025 then, Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny is lacklustre at best. Where it could have delivered is in being a cultural artifact of an incredibly influential game. There are just over one hundred sketches by the game’s character designer, Keita Amemiya, to be enjoyed. This behind-the-scenes peek is fascinating and tremendously interesting. It’s something I wish Capcom had leaned more into. Rather than treating this remake of Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny as being a game simply to play, they could have instead turned it into something akin to the special features on the Blu-ray of a classic film. Commentaries from the developers, explainers from talking heads, insight from fans, original notes and designs, all of these elements would have made for a fascinating re-release and a suitably comprehensive presentation for such an iconic game. As it is, this is a ho-hum remaster that, while it’s welcome to have, feels like a hurried attempt to drum up interest for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-revealed-for-2026/">the upcoming release of Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny is a highly influential classic, one that deserves a lot more love from Capcom than this drab remake has to offer. There was a brilliant opportunity to spoil the player with behind-the-scenes developer content here, but that chance has been squandered. Instead, you get to swap weapons with a button press rather than by going into the menu and sharper visuals. You're best off saving your money and digging your PS2 out of storage, I say.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Rayman AAA Game in the Works at Ubisoft Milan]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan.1194840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once upon a time, earlier in its history as a game developer and publisher, Ubisoft was mainly known for Rayman, rather than Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. The weird-looking character quickly became a fan favorite after the debut in 1995, spawning a whole series of platformer games as well as several spin-offs.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most acclaimed of all installments was also the latest in the mainline series: <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-legends-is-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rayman Legends</a>, which launched in 2013. Since then, though, fans have been wondering whether the iconic Ubisoft mascot would ever return.</p>
<p>It seems like that's happening after all. Internet sleuths have spotted Ubisoft Milan recruiting for a triple-A game set in the IP:</p>
<p><em>Ubisoft Milan <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000058351278-senior-game-designer-rayman-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is looking for a Senior Game Designer</a> who will work on the Rayman brand. The ideal candidate has a proven and solid experience as a Game Designer in the videogame industry with in-depth understanding of how to define, prototype, and implement game systems within the scope of the project and following the Game direction, making sure to capture the gameplay feel, while still being fun and accessible. A strong UX sensibility or professional experience is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft Milan <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000060046042-3d-gameplay-animator-rayman-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is seeking a talented 3D Gameplay Animator</a> to be involved in the production of a prestigious AAA title for the Rayman brand. You will be responsible for ensuring the quality and content of gameplay animation assets align with the game's vision.</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft Milan is mostly known for Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope<span>, the latter&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-boss-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of which featured Rayman</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-boss-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;in a DLC</a>.</p>
<p>The job recruitment follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an earlier rumor by Insider Gaming</a> that Ubisoft Milan is developing a remake of Rayman. As such, it's probably a good idea to expect one of the older games remade for the current generation of hardware rather than a brand new title.</p>

            <p>AMD have rocked up to this year’s Computex tech conference with a <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1253/amd-introduces-new-radeon-graphics-cards-and-ryzen-threadripper-processors-at-computex-2025">handful of new Ryzen Threadripper</a> CPUs (not interested) and confirmation of a long-rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a>, the Radeon RX 9060 XT (cautiously interested). It’s a true mid-ranger in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-review">RTX 5060 Ti</a> vein, and like its Nvidia rival, will launch with both 8GB and 16GB versions – the latter of which will cost $349, the lowest MSRP of any current-gen 16GB gaming GPU, upon its release in June.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Whether or not that pricing holds remains to be seen; AMD’s higher-end <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-prices-look-good-assuming-they-hold">RX 9070</a> GPUs have been famously difficult to find at their advertised starting price, and while the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB was supposed to launch from $379, in practice you’d be lucky to find one below $420. Although, if <em>everyone's</em> GPUs are inflated, then the cheapest one should still remain the cheapest? In theory?</p>
<p>Either way, there are other encouraging signs for the 16GB RX 9060 XT, even if its $299 8GB edition sounds like a bit of a non-starter. It’s the first of AMD’s mid-range cards, for example, to support PCIe 5.0 x16 bandwidth, meaning it will take better advantage of modern motherboard slots than previous Radeons (like the dud <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-radeon-rx-7600-review">RX 7600</a>). Performance-wise, AMD say it’s 6% faster on average than the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p, though in a bit of graphs-bodging that Nvidia themselves would be proud of... that’s only the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti. Presumably the 16GB model puts up a better fight.</p>
<p>You do get the same FSR 4 upscaling compatibility as the RX 9070 family, though, so Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a> advantage might not weigh so heavily. The RX 9060 XT also happens to be launching into what feels like a period of all-time-low goodwill towards the green team, who are currently mired in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/only-press-who-previewed-the-rtx-5060-under-nvidias-test-conditions-are-getting-review-drivers-reports-claim">accusations of giving preferential access to friendly media</a> and attempting to leverage undue pressure on independent review processes.</p>
<p>That won’t make the RX 9060 XT a better graphics card, obviously. But more VRAM, upgraded PCIe tech, and a lower price just might. We’ll find out next month, and I’ll update this story with UK pricing if I can get it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1924835210048290843?t=zXn4Aad3lnqWCuPYQjFefA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Tom Henderson</a>, Ubisoft is preparing to release a Director's Cut of one of its big titles, which could be Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p>
<p>The game launched in December 2023 after over six years of development at Ubisoft Massive. The reception wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 7.5/10 review score from Wccftech reviewer Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a remarkable achievement in many ways, bringing a cinematic world to life on a massive, technically impressive scale like few games have done before. Unfortunately, limited, frustrating combat means the game isn’t always that fun to play once you bump into the RDA. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora’s world is worth experiencing if you’re a fan of James Cameron’s movies, but as the franchise often reminds us, sky people ruin beautiful things.</em></p>
<p>More importantly, it didn't sell as much as Ubisoft was hoping for, especially when accounting for the huge IP it is based on. However, Ubisoft Massive continued to support it after the launch with new features and content such as the two premium DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and Secrets of the Spires. Here's an overview of the latter, which launched around six months ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Explore and discover a fresh open world, built to elevate the thrill of flying on your banshee.</em></li>
<li><em>Sabotage RDA aerial convoys with new banshee skills and a brand-new mounted weapon.</em></li>
<li><em>Meet a secluded Na'vi clan and join them in their fight against a new RDA threat ravaging the Spires region.</em></li>
<li><em>Get lost in the verticality of this new region, filled with canyons and caves, where unexpected dangers lurk in the shadows.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A Director's Cut of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora would obviously include both, as well as other core improvements, in all likelihood. Of course, Ubisoft's primary motive for releasing the new version would be to ride the hype of the new movie, Fire and Ash, slated to launch in theaters on December 19, 2025.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is finally back on iOS devices in the US and Europe, after a five-year legal battle between Epic and Apple.</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"peace proposal" being offered by Epic</a> at the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-blocks-fortnites-return-to-iphone-in-us">Apple later blocked the return of Fortnite</a> in the US. When Epic returned to the judge of the legal case to review its Fortnite submission, the judge responded Apple is "fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing" and warned the official who is "personally responsible for ensuring compliance" would have to return for a hearing (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">TheVerge</a>).</p>
<p>The two companies have since filed a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949416-joint-notice/">joint notice</a> stating they have "resolved all issues".</p>

<p>As such, Fortnite has now returned to iOS devices, with Epic boss Tim Sweeney writing on social media "we back fam".</p>

<p>Though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">Fortnite had already returned to iOS devices in the European Union</a>, Apple's block of the game in the US delayed a regular update to the game, forcing all versions to be taken down.</p>
<p>Of course, the UK is no longer in the EU, meaning Fortnite is not yet available here on iOS. It's <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1794096002762244392">expected in the second half of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">Epic added a direct in-game payment option in Fortnite</a> to circumvent Apple and Google's official in-app purchase options, from which those companies take a 30 percent cut.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Apple pulled Fortnite from its App Store, sparking the five-year feud.</p>
<p>A verdict was finally reached earlier this month, when the US District Court of Northern California found Apple in "wilful violation" of the court's previous injunction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing".</p>
<p>That injunction meant Apple had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which it agreed but levied a 27 percent fee. The court stated this move "strains credulity" and that Apple's goal "was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream". The court verdict added: "In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction."</p>
<p>Sweeney wrote on social media "Game over for the Apple Tax" and stated Fortnite would return to the iOS App store. Now, it finally has.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1924970858558128424">social media last night</a>, Sweeney said: "Thanks to everyone who supported the effort to open up mobile competition and #FreeFortnite from the very beginning. And thanks to all of the folks who initially sided with Apple then later came around to the winning side, supporting app developer rights and consumer rights."</p>
<p>Fortnite has immediately risen to the top free game on iOS in the US.</p>
<p>Epic has this week been in hot water due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">addition of AI Darth Vader to Fortnite</a>, which was quickly used to spout bad language. A hot fix has since been issued, but actors' union <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labour-practice-charge-against-fortnite-maker-epic-following-ai-generated-darth-vader-voice-lines">SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labour practice charge</a> in retaliation for the use of AI.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> has become the "biggest launch" in id Software's history.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244">shared the news on social media</a>, adding three million players had made their way into the fiery pits of hell since the game's release this month.</p>
<p>To put that into more context, Bethesda says Doom: The Dark Ages reached this number seven times faster than Doom Eternal.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1924819963623174653">According to SteamDB</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages topped sales charts for the PC storefront during the week of 13 May - 20 May 2025. It was followed by the Steam Deck in second place, while the remainder of the Steam top five for that week was rounded out by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>While this launch is no doubt an impressive achievement for all those involved in Doom: The Dark Ages' release, it is worth noting that the game was also made available to play via Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1924954084269777113">The Game Business co-founder Chris Dring</a> states that of those three million players, over two million came from Xbox according to figures from Ampere.</p>

<p>We were rather taken with Doom: The Dark Ages, with Chris Donlan calling it a "more grounded" series entry, but "one that's as brisk and playful" as ever.</p>
<p>"As a parent, the game I'm most concerned about these days is probably something like Roblox. By contrast, Doom feels like an entirely known and understood entity. Let's savour it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>. "Here's a slice of pure gaming charisma that has come to us, unfrazzled, from a more innocent time.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, publisher Bethesda Softworks <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages has already reached 3 million players, making it the biggest launch ever in the franchise. For comparison, it was seven times quicker than the previous entry, DOOM Eternal, to get to this milestone.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that Eternal did not launch on Game Pass right away like The Dark Ages. Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda was completed in March 2021, while DOOM Eternal <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released about a year before</a>. It's always hard to make comparisons between games in the same franchise when the new one is available on Microsoft's subscription service, because it inevitably skews data.</p>
<p>Still, it does seem like the reception has been positive overall. DOOM: The Dark Ages is currently sitting at an 86% average user review score on Steam. Here on Wccftech, resident DOOM expert Chris Wray also gave it an 8.5/10<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in his review</a>:</p>
<p><em>So, to put it all quite simply, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a good game—no, it's a very good game. I would recommend it to fans of the genre and people who want to have fun without the risk of anything transmissible via bodily fluids. Unless we're talking about demon blood and guts, there's lots of that. DOOM: The Dark Ages is yet another success from Id Software, and long may they continue.</em></p>
<p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</em></p>

The patch will also add denoising through NVIDIA's DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an interview with Digital Foundry, id Software's Billy Khan <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-not-possible-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> why DOOM: The Dark Ages wouldn't have been possible without ray tracing.</p>

Like the number implies, this graphics card will challenge Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661807/nvidia-rtx-5060-cards-laptops-release-date-price">recently released RTX 5060</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">RTX 5060 Ti</a>, with AMD offering models with 8GB or 16GB of VRAM. AMD is launching both models on June 5th, with the 8GB variant priced at $299, with the 16GB version priced at $349.</p><p>AMD is following Nvidia’s controversial choice to ship a modern GPU with just 8GB of VRAM in the year 2025. The 8GB of VRAM debate has been raging for months now, particularly because of the latest games that can be very demanding on the memory side. AMD is following in Nvidia’s footsteps, though, so it’ll be interesting to see what reviewers make of both cards in this important part of the market.</p><p>The RX 9060 XT will ship with 32 RDNA 4 compute units, a boost clock of 3.13GHz, and support for DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b. The total board power is between 150 watts and 182 watts, depending on the model. AMD claims its 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT will be around 6 percent faster than Nvidia’s RTX 5060 Ti at 1440p resolution, based on 40 games that AMD has tested itself.</p><p>We’re still waiting to hear how the RTX 5060 stacks up, because oddly, Nvidia launched its latest 50-series GPU yesterday without any reviews available. The GPU maker had reportedly prevented reviewers from obtaining the necessary driver to test the RTX 5060 ahead of the release date, presumably because it’s worried about the paltry 8GB of VRAM spec.</p><p>While the 8GB of VRAM choice for both Nvidia and AMD is controversial, Nvidia has managed to spark a further wave of outrage from PC gaming YouTubers over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669538/we-will-not-play-those-games">comments it has made to Gamers Nexus</a>. In a 22-minute video, Gamers Nexus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiekGcwaIho">discusses the pressure from Nvidia</a> to include Multi Frame Generation (MFG) in benchmarks against competitor cards that don’t have a similar feature. Gamers Nexus (GN) alleges that Nvidia has even implied that it would revoke access to interview Nvidia engineers unless the channel discussed MFG more.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 21st</strong>: Article updated with pricing and release date information that AMD didn’t share with The Verge ahead of its press conference.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD didn't provide much by way of performance comparisons, but it's promising that the cards have the same number of compute units as AMD's last-generation RX 7600 series. AMD says that RDNA 4 compute units are much faster than those used for RDNA 3, particularly in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. This helped make the Radeon RX 9070 cards generally as fast or faster than the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT series, despite having around two-thirds as many compute units. Sticking with 32 CUs for the 9060 series isn't exciting on paper, but we should still see a respectable generation-over-generation performance bump. The RX 7600 series, by contrast, provided<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-amds-269-rx-7600-is-a-good-1080p-card-but-the-rtx-4060-looms/"> a pretty modest performance improvement</a> compared to 2022's Radeon RX 6650 XT.</p>


<p>AMD says that the cards' total board power—the amount of power the entire graphics card, including the GPU itself, RAM, and other components—starts at 150 W for the 8GB card and 160 W for the 16GB card, with a maximum TBP of 182 W. That's a shade higher than but generally comparable to the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, and (depending on where actual performance ends up) quite a bit more efficient than the RX 7600 series. This partly comes down to a more efficient 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, a substantial upgrade from the 6nm process used for the 7600 series.</p>
<p>It's unusual for a GPU maker to define a TBP range—more commonly we're just given a single default value. But this is in line with new settings we observed in our RX 9070 review; AMD officially supports a range of different user-selectable TBP numbers in its Catalyst driver package, and some GPU makers were shipping cards that used higher TBPs by default.</p>
<p>Higher power limits can increase performance, though usually the performance increase is disproportionately small compared to the increase in power draw. These power limits should also generally mean that most 9060 XTs can be powered with a single 8-pin power connector, rather than using multiple connectors or the 12-pin 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 connector.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review-in-progress.1194738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong></em><em>This review in progress is based entirely on the Early Access version of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and will be updated with final impressions after the playing the 1.0 version at launch.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game of Thrones is a series synonymous with epic battles, familial betrayal, and mythical creatures. It’s no wonder, then, that developer Netmarble used it as the backing for its latest mobile-friendly open-world RPG, plopping you right into the middle of the original HBO show with one major goal to achieve: Power. Yet, after 20 hours gallivanting through the Early Access version of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s northern factions, consolidating my wealth ahead of its full launch this week, I can’t help but feel worried about what lies ahead as I work my way toward a final review. It’s not the towering enemies or backstabbing friends waiting for me down south that I fear – it’s the reality of just how much grinding (or money) it’s going to take to get there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/23/game-of-thrones-season-4-review"><u>Game of Thrones’ fourth season</u></a>, Kingsroad allows you to join the story as a bastard child and sole remaining heir of House Tyre. With your lord father unwell, your job is to explore Westeros in search of support so that you can buck the bastard title and ascend to lead your people when the time comes. You’ll meet plenty of familiar faces along this journey, too, from Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly to less likeable characters like Roose and Ramsay Bolton. While it might seem like a dense point in the overall plot to drop in, Kingsroad does a decent job of introducing the series’ broader themes through a speedy tutorial, which briefly takes you beyond the Wall to lay up the threat of the White Walkers and the world’s ongoing dynastic conflicts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you grapple with the inherent drama of Westeros, you’ll need to pick a character archetype to play as – a decision that will dictate the style of combat you’ll use as you level up. There are three options to choose from: A balanced sword-wielding Knight, a beefy axe-wielding Sellsword, and a nimble dagger-wielding Assassin. Inspired by Tormund and Brienne of Tarth, I opted for the hulking Sellsword, whose rage and size could sweep through larger groups of enemies with relative ease. If you’re indecisive (like me) and want to mix up your playstyle, the good news is that you can start up an alternate class at any time from the main menu and share loot between your warriors. You’ll still have to replay the central story missions with each one, but this helpful feature at least allows you to sneakily boost their stats and speed through the early game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve made your choice, you’ll also be able to mould their look using Kingsroad’s surprisingly complex character creator. Alongside sliders that control each muscle of the face, you can choose beard length and colour, add battle scars, and even adjust the sheen of their hair. It hasn’t got the intense depth of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-review"><u>Dragon’s Dogma 2</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-review-early-access"><u>inZOI</u></a>, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I could tweak my progeny's features to my liking. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Westeros has been faithfully recreated, but that initial sheen wears off quickly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t simply walk into King's Landing and have your wish to rule House Tyre granted, though. To earn your regal title, you’ll need to work your way up the food chain and earn the respect of the ruling Ladies and Lords of the land. This means completing side quests, clearing out bandits and fiends, and collecting as much loot as you can carry to upgrade your armour. On the surface, this might sound like an enticing fantasy workload. Unfortunately, Kingsroad doesn’t quite have the technical chops to make these tasks truly draw you in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Westeros has been faithfully recreated, and I relished the opportunity to take in the vast icy presence of the Wall and explore the cobbled walkways of Winterfell. However, that initial sheen wears off quickly when you linger a little too long in an area. Patches of grass pop up and down uncannily, and objects or NPCs all start to repeat. Suddenly, this mythical world loses its lustre and feels like a strange simulation. That isn’t helped by how odd the NPCs look and move, with many of the citizens I came in contact with acting as either overly dynamic animatronics or still paintings that eerily follow you with their eyes. This unsettling style is most noticeable in conversations, with some villagers' jaws and eyes oscillating in unnerving fashion as they explain their routine predicaments. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This strange locomotion applied to my own movement as well, and no matter if I was on foot or mounted, it always felt as though I was skating on ice. That was more noticeable on frosty ground, which is surely intentional, but it frequently seemed like I was skidding on top of dry earth as well, with a slight delay to all my actions. Drifting my mount through twisty country roads was funny to begin with, but the constant unwieldy nature of movement gets frustrating fast. Often enough, I would catapult myself off the edge of a hill into an enemy camp without the ability to quickly course correct. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also a mixed bag, with lots of repeated attack patterns whether I was taking on an area boss or a simple grunt. The foes I was facing were a rotating crew of the same faces, the only difference being how many I would face at once. You dodge or dash out of the way of enemies and then return their hits with a mixture of light, heavy, and special attacks that don’t really attempt to do anything unexpected or fresh. Occasionally, I would be surprised by a quest that required me to use some strategy, like separating select enemies from a larger pack to get an advantage – but more often than not, combat simply came down to taking on gaggles of soldiers until I’d meet their overly familiar boss. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat is a mixed bag, with lots of repeated attack patterns.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story cutscenes surrounding my actions were at least enticing, pulling at my heartstrings as they urged me to help find missing children or take out bandits that were attacking weakened farmers. Sadly, the actual process of completing those tasks quickly felt thankless because of the rote combat. There are upgrade trees that can diversify your moveset as you level up, and I’m keen to investigate them further to see how they impact encounters in the full game, but in this early portion, fighting is mostly monotonous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, you can find platforming puzzles nestled across the sizable, icon-covered map that offer a decent reprieve from the mindless fighting, even in spite of the floaty movement. Amongst the medieval castles and quaint villages, dilapidated buildings and cliff faces hide secrets that you can pinpoint with your area scanning tool. Hidden doorways and chests await, usually providing useful caches of loot or lore. When you’re wandering around and getting into the flow of it all, Kingsroad can start to resemble something like a stripped-back mobile port of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The interface design and structure of the open-world and combat seem particularly derivative of Ubisoft’s viking odyssey. It’s not a bad skeleton for a Game of Thrones game, though it can feel a bit egregious at times as you use your ping to highlight hidden enemies. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, barriers are set up around this open world in the form of Recommended Momentum requirements. Momentum is a bit like Gear Score in Destiny, a numerical valuation of your stats that takes into account your armour and skill progression, equipped accessories, and more. You’ll need to buff every aspect of your character in order to surpass the criteria required for exploring a new area, which is a reasonable enough limitation if properly tuned. But, rather predictably for a game with its eye on a mobile audience, the trove of consistent loot I was earning from early missions inevitably started to dry up, and I came face to face with the <em>real</em> amount of work needed to continue unlocking story missions. This is where the sinister undertone of Kingsroad’s live service design really starts to rear its head. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bevy of activities available are persistently counterbalanced by the copious microtransactions peppered throughout. Even beyond the bog-standard battle pass and abundance of different in-game currencies, I was surprised to see just how much of the actual gameplay was tied to some form of transaction. For example, when you die in combat, you can choose to wait 30 seconds or pay to come back faster with all your healing items intact – an essential inclusion if you want to avoid trawling back to camp to buy more items. Alternatively, you can fast travel the slow way by hoofing it to a special signpost, or pay for a premium version where you can warp for free from anywhere on the map. Annoyingly, all of these features impact how efficiently you can reach the Momentum requirements needed to progress, so you’re always goaded to put your hand in your pocket.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>20 hours in, it feels as though I've barely scratched the surface.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind every passably accessible system was a far more user-friendly one, but only if you’re willing to fork out for it. It felt as though Netmarble was more concerned with making Kingsroad just frustrating enough to encourage people to spend a bit of cash rather than making the base game reasonably enjoyable on its own. While it’s naive to assume a free-to-play game such as this wouldn’t offer some form of paid content, a cash-based system has been implemented into almost every corner of what’s here, and it cheapens both the world you are exploring and any success you may find there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps what’s most upsetting about this model is that beneath the plethora of currencies and grind-heavy progression, Kingsroad <em>does </em>have the capacity to capture the magic of its source material. Riding on a dire wolf across hazy pastoral lands and watching them gradually gain a coat of frost feels cinematic on occasion (and, again, as long as you don’t stop to look too closely). Plus, the stories of the quests I’ve tackled so far do well to curate a tragic atmosphere. But when push comes to shove, the mythic world I was reaching for was always shoved just slightly out of reach by some intrusive nudge to pull out my wallet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s a silver lining, it’s that it still feels as though I’m barely scratching the surface Game of Thrones: Kingsroad despite sinking over 20 hours into it already. There’s so much more I want to explore in the 1.0 version before I deliver my final verdict, like artefacts, upgrade trees, and the estate management systems. As of right now, though, one thing is abundantly clear: When you play Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, you pay or you die.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-app-store-return<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After five years, <em>Fortnite</em> returned to the Apple App Store today. As someone who woke up one morning in August 2020 and tossed up a <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quick blog</a> about Epic introducing its own payment system on mobile, a niche news hit that quickly spiralled into multiple high-profile court battles between massive companies that dragged on for years, I don't know what I'm going to do with myself now.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account </a>announced the news this evening, linking to the game on the App Store. As of this writing, I couldn't find it when I searched "Fortnite," but I was able to find it by searching for Epic Games.</p><p>The game's return follows a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling</a> at the end of April that Apple was disobeying the orders from the 2021 ruling in the case by <a href="https://aftermath.site/apples-new-app-store-policy-is-petty-as-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a large commission</a> from purchases outside the App Store and overly restricting how developers could point users to alternate payment systems. Following the April ruling, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store once again, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-resubmits-fortnites-us-app-store-request-after-not-hearing-back-from-apple-all-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew and resubmitted it</a> when Apple didn't reply to the request. Yesterday, the judge basically <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/19/apple-fortnite-epic-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered Apple to figure it out</a>, and now here we are. In the meantime, <em>Fortnite</em> has been playable on <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-phones-eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some mobile devices</a> in the US and in the EU on Epic's own mobile storefront, though none of this has been as widespread or as seamless as the App Store.</p><p>To make myself the protagonist of this news story: It's kind of a big moment for me. That very first blog led me into my first foray into reading court documents, and I followed every update of the case for months, spending my weekends tediously reading through filings and looking up every legal phrase I didn't know. When one of the earliest rulings came down, I actually had a nightmare that I'd missed it, only to wake up in the middle of the night and realize I <em>had</em> missed it. The day the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-thats-happening-in-the-apple-vs-epic-case-1846856678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trial</a> started I was at New York's Javits Center, listening to the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-epic-vs-apple-hearing-is-already-a-disaster-1846811839?_gl=1*ptlplv*_ga*NTc0Nzc5NjU1LjE3NDM3OTkzOTY.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc3ODA5MzgkbzYzJGcxJHQxNzQ3NzgyNjczJGoyMiRsMCRoMCRkY1EtUlFvM1VFcmEyYzRPTWtvNWRzNExseWpnVjkyNzk4Zw.." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous call-in line</a> while waiting to get my first covid shot. By the time the judge decided the case I had left Kotaku, and I found myself frantically posting my way through the court documents on social media while visiting my parents. When they asked what I was doing, I said "working," and they politely reminded me that... no I wasn't, because I didn't have a job, which was one of the first moments my departure from Kotaku really sunk in. I feel like I grew alongside this case as a journalist, while I probably devolved a little as a person, boring anyone who would listen with why, yeah it's that game with all the dances, but <em>listen</em>, Epic's arguments are actually kind of a <a href="https://aftermath.site/epic-google-app-store-ruling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big deal</a> if you care about tech monopolies.</p><p>And now here we are. I don't know what I'll do with all my freed-up brain space, or all the time I'll get back now that I won't feel pressured to constantly keep tabs on Tim Sweeney's Twitter. Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661032/apple-epic-games-app-store-antitrust-ninth-circuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the April ruling, so we'll see if this is really the end, but fittingly, writing this blog has made me late to meet some friends, whom I will absolutely bore to tears with this latest update, and who will humor me politely while wishing I would stop talking about this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop"><h3>Tabletop Game Going Rogue Puts The Revolution Back In Star Wars</h3></a><p>Jess Levine, designer of Going Rogue, talks political organizing and taking the Disney out of Star Wars</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra"><h3>Fortnite’s AI Darth Vader Has, Predictably, Been A Comedy Of Errors</h3></a><p>Swears, slurs, and an unfair labor practice – all in just a few days</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Developer Shift Up has quietly announced its acclaimed sci-fi hack-and-slash adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel - and it looks like it's due to arrive before the end of next year.
</p>
<p>
Shift Up shared the news as part of its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">recent investor presentation</a>, tucking mention of a Stellar Blade sequel away on a slide highlighting its "IP expansion" plans for 2025 and 2026. The studio's free-to-play sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke got a mention, as did the mysterious "Project Witches", but it's Stellar Blade we're interested in here.
</p>
<p>Two key developments were listed under the Stellar Blade header: firstly, a "platform expansion", which seems likely to be a reference to the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">imminent arrival on PC</a> - a release Shift Up has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">extremely high hopes for</a>. And then next to that, an unassuming second blue box tagged with the all-important word "sequel".

<p>
Shift Up's sequel announcement didn't come with any specific details, but one interesting takeaway is the timeline the studio looks to be working on. According to Shift Up's slide, Stellar Blade 2 is due to launch before 2027, strongly suggesting the developer is targeting a 2026 release - less than two years after the launch of the first game. That feels like a remarkably swift turnaround time for a fully fledged AAA sequel.

<p>
Hopefully, though, Stellar Blade 2 can live up to the standard set by its acclaimed predecessor, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">awarded four stars in Eurogamer's review</a>. "Stellar Blade has a fair bit of weirdness," Jessica Orr wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."
</p>
<p>
PC players can pick up Stellar Blade via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stellar-blade-fa21c3">Epic</a> when it launches on 11th June. Additionally, a Complete Edition arrives for PC and PlayStation 5 on the same day, bundling together the base game, various cosmetics for protagonist EVE, and more. PC players should note, however, Stellar Blade is currently blocked in over 120 countries, which seems to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">surprised Shift Up as much as everyone else</a>. Over the weekend, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-studio-says-it-is-closely-discussing-the-region-lock-issue-with-playstation">said it was "closely discussing the region lock issue" with Sony</a> in the hope of finding a solution before 11th June.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Fortnite</em> is once again available on the iOS App Store in the US, <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199">according to Epic Games</a>. You can get it from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fortnite/id6483539426">the App Store here</a>. Epic says it has returned to the Epic Games Store and AltStore as well.</p><p>Apple kicked <em>Fortnite</em> off the App Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">nearly five years ago</a> after Epic Games added its own in-app payment system to the game, which violated Apple’s rules. But after a major court ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">forced Apple</a> to not take fees from purchases made outside of apps, the game is available to play on US iPhones once again.</p><p>Shortly after the big ruling hit, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">CEO Tim Sweeney said</a> that Epic planned to bring back <em>Fortnite</em> to iOS in the US. He also made a “peace proposal:” “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll return <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.“</p><div><p>On May 9th, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664245/epic-submitted-fortnite-to-apple">submitted the app to Apple</a>. Ahead of that, Sweeney said that Epic would use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">its Sweden developer account</a> to submit the game to the US App Store.</p></div><p>Late last week, Epic said that Apple had blocked <em>Fortnite’s</em> return to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668232/fortnite-ios-unavailable-worldwide-apple-epic">the App Store</a>, and the game also became unavailable on other alternative app stores in the EU. However, Apple said that it had “asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impact <em>Fortnite</em> in other geographies” and that “we did not take any action to remove the live version of <em>Fortnite</em> from alternative distribution marketplaces.”</p><p>Epic asked the judge in the <em>Epic v. Apple</em> case to order Apple to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669047/epic-fortnite-filing-apple-app-store-review-order">review its <em>Fortnite</em> submission</a> on May 16th. Yesterday, the judge said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669676/apple-is-fully-capable-of-resolving-this-issue-without-further-briefing-or-a-hearing">in a filing</a> that Apple is “fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,” and that if a resolution wasn’t reached, the Apple official who “is personally responsible for ensuring compliance” would have to appear at a hearing next Tuesday.</p><p>However, shortly after <em>Fortnite</em> returned to the App Store on Tuesday, Epic and Apple <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949416-joint-notice/">filed a joint notice</a> saying that they have “resolved all issues” from Epic’s May 16th filing. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Epic also recently rolled out a new promotion to encourage players to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659655/epic-games-store-revenue-share-webshops-apple-in-app-purchases">use its payment systems</a>: if you use Epic’s system in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League</em>, or <em>Fall Guys</em> on PC, iOS, Android, and the web, the company will give you 20 percent back in Epic Rewards that can be used for other purchases in its games or on the Epic Games Store.</p><p>In the iOS version of <em>Fortnite</em> that was released on Tuesday, the app shows you that 20 percent bonus when you pick which payment system you want to use to buy V-Bucks.</p><div><p>The company launched a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed season</a> for <em>Fortnite</em> on May 2nd.</p></div><p>If you get the app from the App Store, it will be a small initial download, and after you actually open the app, it will download the rest of the game. For a colleague, that additional download was 12.95GB.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 20th</strong>: Added details of Epic and Apple’s joint notice.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
