			<p>The FBI has seized and taken down one of the more prominent Nintendo Switch ROM sites, Nsw2u. First reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site was seized earlier this week on Thursday, though according to some of the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/new/">Switch Piracy Reddit page</a>, the site remained up for a few hours before being entirely taken down. If you try to visit the website now, you'll be met with a splash screen from the FBI notifying that the site has been seized "<em>in accordance with a seizure warrant</em>."</p>



<p>The splash screen also includes a logo from the FIOD Tax Administration, a Dutch agency that was involved in investigating the site and having it taken down. Nintendo has not commented on the takedown, but it's clear that this is a part of the company's more aggressive effort to combat piracy on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices. </p>



<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">ability to brick Switch 2 devices</a> is something that's been widely reported by now, another sign of just how serious Nintendo is about players using their devices in what the company deems to be an "<em>unauthorized</em>" way, even if they are being fought<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/"> by regional government agencies</a>. After all, it didn't take very much for players to be able to jailbreak Switch devices at launch. All it took to open the door to a jailbroken Switch was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip,</a> before Nintendo had released revised models of the console to nullify the popular method. </p>



<p>That didn't stop players from jailbreaking the device, however, and the battle against piracy is one Nintendo continues to fight. </p>

Props to the studio for acknowledging the game’s popularity and trying to curb some of this kind of behavior. The full list of guidelines is as follows:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center to discover if visits are possible.</li><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center for details on the times of visits.</li><li>Follow the instructions provided by the staff working at the stables.</li><li>Do not enter stable buildings or grazing land without permission.</li><li>Do not shout or make loud noises.</li><li>Never touch the horses.

                <p dir="ltr">The unique hook to the anime horse girls of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> is that the characters are each based on actual famous race horses. With the sports sim's surging popularity in North America, this may be seeing an interest among new fans to visit the real horses themselves. With that in mind, the game's developer Cygames has <a href="https://umamusume.com/news/200003/" rel="nofollow ">published</a> guidelines for people wishing to visit stables.</p><p dir="ltr">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has already been a hit in Japan since the original mobile release in 2021, spawning manga, anime, and even a stage adaptation. But since its global release last month, strong word of mouth, including streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce, has helped catapult it to widespread attention, where earlier this week it hit its all-time-peak of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-is-galloping-up-the-charts-on-steam/1100-6533094/">just over 50,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That seems to have also prompted more enquiries from fans who want to actually visit the real-life race horses the titular Umamusume are based on, as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" rel="nofollow ">BlueSky user</a> has noted that appointments to visit Haru Urara, a race horse beloved for her long losing streak, has already been booked out for the month. Their post also included a screenshot from a Twitter user urging fans to "please be respectful and follow the rules".</p><p dir="ltr">Those rules are now available on the Umamasume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" rel="nofollow ">website</a>, and they advise prospective visitors to contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center rather than the stables directly for a visit. It also warns, "Horses are extremely sensitive to their surroundings. Even what seems like a small change to a person could be a shocking, scary, or stressful event to them. For the safety and well-being of the horses, we ask all Umamusume fans to follow all rules and practice good etiquette when visiting stables in Japan."</p><p dir="ltr">The guidance is only for when visiting stables in Japan, but fans are advised to check local resources for information and rules if they wish to visit stables outside of Japan.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has commented on the possible turn-based future of the series, following the recent success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, Final Fantasy games have moved away from classic turn-based battles and progressed towards the all-action gameplay of 2023's Final Fantasy 16, which disappointed some long-term fans.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur, released earlier this year, features an action twist on turn-based battles and has become something of an exemplary talisman for RPG fans hoping <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s series will return to its roots.</p>

<p>Now, in a recent interview at the Anime Expo 2025, Yoshida (also director and producer of MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>) was asked what the success of Clair Obscur could mean for the future of Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," he told <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405">Anime News Network</a>. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel.</p>
<p>"It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based."</p>
<p>He added: "[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail."</p>
<p>While I personally enjoyed the ambitious, cinematic storytelling of Final Fantasy 16 and its Game of Thrones inspired setting, I can understand why some felt its action combat was a big departure from series tradition. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, for instance, more readily blurred the boundary between turn-based and action battles.</p>
<p>Yet when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">I interviewed Yoshida ahead of Final Fantasy 16's launch</a> about the essence of the series, he responded: "I think, for me, that Final Fantasy is all about making that cinematic experience. You think back all the way to the original Final Fantasy on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, you start out, you play the game a little bit, you get to a certain point, and then you finally get that opening scene. And that truly cinematic experience, it separates itself from other games and makes it like a movie."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-discusses-the-essence-of-the-series">Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the series, stated in an interview with Yoshida</a> at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in London 2023 that Final Fantasy is all about taking risks.</p>
<p>"I think with Final Fantasy you always want to take a challenge, to take an adventure into building a new system for the new installment, that courage to be able to take that risk," he said.</p>
<p>"Of course it's a very hard job and a very large undertaking, but with a series that has continued for this long sometimes people might think, 'Why don't you just make more of the same thing?'. I think that shouldn't be the case in Final Fantasy."</p>
<p>I agree that what makes the series special is how unique each game is and how daring its developers have been in trying something new with each installment. It's a series about pioneering new ideas, not following trends. I would love to see that continue with Final Fantasy 17.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>A return to the tradition of turn-based battles would look like a step backwards for the series, and a white flag from Square Enix it's resigned to compete with Sandfall (and, really, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Atlus</a>) in the turn-based stakes instead of looking forward.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Square Enix admitted sales of both Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a>, so perhaps it's time for a rethink for the next mainline entry.</p>
<p>What's more, that celebration of tradition certainly worked for Final Fantasy 9. And perhaps that rumoured remake could satisfy long-term fans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrates-final-fantasy-9s-25th-anniversary-so-wheres-the-rumoured-remake">if, in fact, it's ever released</a>.</p>
<p>Until then, Yoshida has assisted with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">forthcoming remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, that's due out in September. It might also be turn-based, but as a strategy tactics game it's yet another example of the combat variety the Final Fantasy series offers.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">

<p>Well, that escalated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Repair firm iFixit has performed a full teardown of the Switch 2's Pro Controller, delivering a scathing review of the repairability and potential durability of the accessory. Ultimately, it calls the Pro Controller a "p**s-poor excuse for a controller".</p>
<p>But why? Well, watching the video reveals just how tricky it is to actually get into the Pro Controller, with Nintendo applying adhesives to the front faceplate, lots of hidden screws, and thumb-grips that need "an uncomfortable amount of force to remove". Essentially, iFixit believes that the work required to simply reach the controller's battery for potential replacement is far too difficult for the average consumer.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we have the potential issue of stick drift. iFixit believes the potentiometer stick technology used in the Switch 2's Pro Controller means it will likely still be prone to drifting. That said, it says that the sticks themselves are slightly easier to remove than that of the original Switch Pro Controller.</p>
<p>As for the good news (if you can call it good news), the headphone jack is fully modular and easily removable. In fact, iFixit says that this is probably the only positive that it can muster when it comes to assessing the Pro Controller.</p>
<p>In conclusion, iFixit points to cheaper controllers such as the <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1443193.html">Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit</a> as accessories that accomplish much more at a lower price, including the additions of TMR and Hall Effect sticks.</p>
<p>Now, in practice, the Pro Controller for the Switch 2 is astoundingly comfortable to use, with excellent-feeling sticks and a strong d-pad. However, as time goes on and more folks find the need to repair their controllers, it seems Nintendo has made it about as difficult as possible to actually get into the bloomin' things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just over 3 years ago, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">current 2-player starter set</a> for <em>Bushido</em> Risen Sun. That set introduced 2 rival families, which could be included as ronin across all factions. Civil Hands Unclean, which adds new ronin sent in support of the families, is releasing soon as an expansion to the 2-player starter set. In this article, we'll have a look at the new fighters and which factions can use them. We also have a preview of an upcoming card that's currently in playtesting at the end of the review.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>In the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set, the&nbsp;Hozumi and the Kiyozumi family are at war, framed by the Romeo and Juliet love story of Koga and&nbsp;Hinadori. Civil Hands Unclean is a 2-Player Starter Set Expansion, and while the <em>Bushido</em> 2PSS isn't required to use this product (the minitures it contains are Ronin and can be used by a variety of factions), it continues the story, and the contents add directly to the original box, taking both forces up to the full 100-rice warbands.</p>

<p>Hozumi Daihanji, the senior Hozumi, has called on warriors from his past to assist in the feud. The first of these is Gocho, a battle-tested warrior, summoned back from retirement. While not a dangerous fighter, Gocho does well in groups of Ashigaru, with a ki feat that can grant other ashigaru within its aura a fear stat equal to the number of friendly ashigaru within it, and while Gocho has a Frightened marker, which his steadfast trait negates a lot of, other friendly ashigaru gain fearless.</p>

<p>Gocho can join Prefecture of Ryu, Minimoto, and Shiho warbands, and his Permission to Speak unique effect means that he can be included in themes for those warbands as if he were friendly ashigaru.</p>

<p>The second fighter Daihanji summoned is a former bandit leader who, after being defeated, swore to aid Daihanji when needed. Tozoku has some history with&nbsp;Kenmeina from the opposing family, which is demonstrated through the Hatred trait. In offence, Tozoku has a Bandit Blade ki feat that can remove enemy dice from a melee exchange, with the option for your opponent to transfer ki to Tozoku to keep the dice.</p>

<p>Tozoku also comes with a Hozumi Introduction enhancement that can be purchased, allowing them and other Hozumi models to be included in themes as if they were faction models. Tozoku can be taken by Ito, Silvermoon, Descencion, Jung, and Shiho warbands.</p>

<p>To aid their cause,&nbsp;Kiyozumi Sadaka has called upon a distant cousin from the great Ito clan, Ito Saiaku. Although Ito in name, Saiaku's profile is a ronin profile, and they deploy with their 2 servants. Saiaku is an interesting unit. He can sacrifice either of the 2 servants to prevent damage and has a melee of 3 with Prowess (1), which allows him to reroll a dice during the exchange. He has to use fortune each turn, which is a coin flip to gain 2 or zero ki a turn. Saiaku and the 2 servants must also use leech each turn, which they can't do off each other, so you'll need to keep other fighters nearby, or risk them all gaining control markers and your opponent getting an action out of each of them.</p>

<p>Saiaku does have some solid ki feats, including a once per game that can stop your opponent outright winning the tactical roll that turn and also negating the tactician trait from the unit using it for the rest of the game. An aura ki feat that increases the cost of ki feats and ki boosts from all units within the aura by 1, and my favorite, Inflated Reputation, which gives Saiaku Fear (6) until the end of the turn, unless he has 3 marked wound boxes, as his facade fails.</p>

<p>Saiaku can also have any number of Enhancement - Equipment cards, and one of the servants, Tahei, has a ki feat that can add any permitted Ronin Enhancement - Equipment card to Saiaku. If this ability isn't used each turn, Saiaku and both servants are removed from play. So you will want to bring a stock of permitted equipment cards to throw on Saiaku throughout the game, gaining him more abilities with each turn, along with making sure Tahei has ki to spend and is nearby Saiaku to use it.</p>

<p>Ito Saiaku comes with the permanent unique effect of allowing themselves and Kiyozumi models to be taken in themes as if they were faction models, and can be taken as standard by the Cult of Yurei, Ito Clan, Silvermoon Syndicate, and the Shiho Clan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=0sBSswhf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=4MayuTFI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ito Saiaku drags his 2 servants, Tahei and Matashichi in support of the Kiyozumi clan in <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches Boon</h2>

<p>GCT Studios have kindly offered us a preview of an upcoming card for the next cycle deck that's currently undergoing playtesting, so is subject to change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jade Witch</strong> <em>Enhancement</em></p>

<p>When the Attached model Targets a Soulless model with a Ki Feat, the Ki Feat loses {Opposed Ki}.</p>

<p>When the Attached model performs a Simple Ki Feat Action, this model gains a Spell Token.</p>

<p>The Attached model may remove 2 Spell Tokens to gain a third Activation Counter that turn but it must perform a Simple Ki Feat Action during that Activation.</p>

<p>For effects that count number of Shisai, this model counts as 2 Shisai. (it does not count as 2 models for any other purpose).</p>

<p>Requirement [Ayako] Rice Cost: 1 Max: 1</p>

<p><em>A messiah may draw the attention of the people, but the priestess has the notice of the kami.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This enhancement card, for the Ito Clan, means that Ayako's ki feats all become regular tests against soulless models, rather than opposed tests. All 3 of her ki feats are also simple, meaning that she can essentially use 2 ki feats a turn and still take another action. The final part of the enhancement, making Ayako count as 2 Shisai, means that for her own unique ability, she grants herself Resistance (2) and Willpower (2), giving her an advantage of opposed ki tests.</p>

<p>GCT will be revealing more cards from the upcoming cycle as it approaches release.</p>

<p>Civil Hands Unclean includes some incredibly thematic new units that play into their lore very well. It expands the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set perfectly and adds interesting dynamics to the game. Not all factions can use the units in this set, Savage Wage, Shadow Wind, Temple of Ro-Kan, The Awoken and&nbsp;Kinshi Temple are locked out, but if you have the 2-Player Starter Set, you can build 2 100-rice warbands under the Kiyozumi and Hozumi themes, and add these units to any factions that allow their use.</p>

<p>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean 2-Player Starter Set Expansion will be available soon as a Retailer exclusive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one knows how it started, but everyone knows that they are here. The Savage Wave of oni, demons from myth and legend, and waves of goblins, has descended on the Jwar Isles. Before they fully become oni, there is a rite of passage, and the onisho need to pass through the ring of fire to prove their worth or perish in the attempt. You might think that not being full oni means they're not as powerful, their rage not as all-consuming. You would be wrong. In this article, we'll have a look at the new Ring of Fire themed warband for the Savage Wave. We'll talk about the new and returning fighters, and where you can go next.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=HIZRB8L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/Inari%27s%20Judgement%20%281%29.jpg?itok=NZXYfWyT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Thematically Themed</h2>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Savage Wave is a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and The Ring of Fire is a theme card that restricts you to onisho, but gives them some incredible benefits that play into their theme.</p>

<p>Using the theme, all friendly onisho gain the last stand trait, which means that if they're reduced to 0 wounds, they're not removed from the battlefield until the end of the turn. Normally, units with last stand can't heal, but onisho can still heal using their consume soul or soul thirst abilities. For every onisho that's removed from play during a game, when an onisho uses oni rage, consume soul, or soul thirst, they gain ki and heal an amount equal to the number of friendly units removed so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-2.jpg?itok=yL1sNQ0e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-2.jpg?itok=5IuxAJRP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Ring of Fire onisho for <em>Bushido</em> are just as brutal as the fully fledged oni.</figcaption></figure><h2>All The Rage All The Time</h2>

<p>The Ring of Fire themed warband includes 5 onisho for the Savage Wave, 3 new models, and 2 returning models with updated sculpts. All of the onisho here have the consume soul ki feat, which is a once-per-turn instant use, that allows them to heal wounds equal to the ki stat of an enemy model removed from play within 3 inches of them.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is led by Junec, who comes armed with Brutal (1), +2 damage swords, along with armor 2 and tough 1, making them difficult to damage, and even more difficult to remove with their healing through enemy removal and last stand ability with the theme. They also have ki feats that let them use banzai to charge for 1 activation (rather than 2), and add +1 to their brutal trait.</p>

<p>Backing up Junec are Jokash and Kuroko. Jokash comes armed with the pole-armed style agoniser, which is only +1 damage (most of the onisho have +2 damage weapons), but it does have reach to allow them to go first in combat if they're not in base-to-base contact. Their indomitable trait means they ignore small and tiny enemy models they're engaged with for penalties and have their melee stat ki boost reduced by the number of them they're engaged with. With armor 3 and tough 1, throwing them into hordes of smaller enemies only benefits them.</p>

<p>Kuroko is armed with a +2 damage ranged arbalest to hit targets you can't reach in melee. The onisho don't benefit from killing targets at range, and with reload 1 and 2 ammo (which can be replenished by taking no actions for a turn), you will want to throw Kuroko into the fray and use the arbalest stock in melee, unless you need to use the arblast to get past armored and tough foes.</p>

<p>Boba and Kano are two older sculpts who have received updated models and retained the same stat cards. Boba likes to throw +2 damage iron skulls, with ki feats to increase the attack range and gain rapid fire 2. Kano likes to dish out stunned markers with their batter ki feat and +2 damage club.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-3.jpg?itok=C-AzN8RF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-3.jpg?itok=lSXXM4Qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The onisho in the Ring of Fire themed warband for <em>Bushido,</em> totals 87-rice just for the 5 fighters alone.</figcaption></figure><h2>Brutal Cunning</h2>

<p>The rice cost of the included onisho in Ring of Fire is 87, and you can easily make up the rest of the 100-point rice cost with the 17 enhancement and event cards included in the set. Each fighter has a unique card enhancement for them, and the rest are generic enhancements or events. My favorite is the There Can Be Only One event, which means that if there is only 1 friendly onisho remaining, it doesn't remove activation counters while enemy units have activation counters, so they can continue to activate multiple times until your opponent finishes their activations. You're going to be extremely aggressive with your onisho, so it's a great just-in-case card to mean you can dish out some insane damage in a phase where you only have 1 onisho left, especially when combined with the last stand ability.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is extremely aggressive, allowing you to throw your fighters into combat, knowing that they can heal and are difficult to remove because of layers of armor and tough. They have abilities that allow them to come out on top in combat and deal massive damage when they do. The themed last stand ability means that even if your opponent takes them out, they're still dangerous until the end of the turn, and can still heal and keep going.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-5.jpg?itok=NfFueXi0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-ring-of-fire-5.jpg?itok=f9q14Fte 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bushido</em> has 3 other onisho available already, Goro, Tsuta and Yasei.</figcaption></figure><h2>Increasing Aggression</h2>

<p>On top of the previous 2 onisho who've had updated sculps for this pack, 3 other onisho are available, and another is releasing alongside The Ring of Fire. Goro is a huge onisho, on par with Junec in damage-dealing terms. Tsuta and Yasei are slightly cheaper onisho, with Tsuta having ranged options and the only support ki feat out of the whole group with Idolize that can boost another onisho's melee pool. Yasei deals damage with only their fists, with +2 damage wrestling, and a unique ability that always adds another wound to damage rolls in melee.</p>

<p>Releasing alongside The Ring of Fire is Merlek, an onisho shugenja, or magic user. They still have a +2 damage staff, but also a short-range black magic attack that increases in damage for each enemy they damage. They have a Fall into the Ring ki feat, which gives all oni and onisho in the aura strong, making damage tests easier, and all other models in the aura weak, making damage tests more difficult for them. They also have the most thematic of ki feats for the warband, Ring of Fire, which puts a 4-inch aura in the centre of the battlefield, and units within it can't allocate dice to defense.</p>

<p>This is my first experience with the Savage Wave, and they do exactly as you would expect. There's something freeing about throwing your fighters entirely into combat, knowing that your opponent will be on the defensive, and even if they're not, they will struggle to even damage your fighters and, almost impossible to remove them. I love the fact that there is also always the risk of you dropping There Can Be Only One when you've only one fighter left, for an insane final turn with your fighter rushing to deal as much damage as possible while your opponent tries to avoid them. Someone said something about victory points, but I was too busy smashing their forces into the dirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ring of Fire will be available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" rel="nofollow">preorder from the GCT website</a>&nbsp;in the coming months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Original Subnautica Director Sues Krafton After Dismissal]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/original-subnautica-director-sues-krafton-after-dismissal.1241463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>creators Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill have announced that they're suing Krafton, the parent company of his now-former studio Unknown Worlds, following his dismissal from the company.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Cleveland, along with fellow co-creators McGuire and Gill, was ousted from Unknown Worlds earlier this month. Krafton initially didn't provide a reason for their dismissal, but in a <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/krafton-addresses-subnautica-2-changes-while-devs-issue-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequent statement</a>, the company alleged that after what it calls the "failure" of Unknown Worlds' game&nbsp;<em>Moonbreaker</em>, Cleveland "chose to focus on a personal film project" rather than resuming&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>development.</p>

<p>However, as you might expect, Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disputes</a> Krafton's version of events. He says that he "would never willingly abandon [<em>Subnautica</em>] or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it", reiterating that he and his team believed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>&nbsp;was ready for release in 2025 and that the situation "needs to be made right".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit-fish-scanning.jpg?itok=jXWn_Ml8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit-fish-scanning.jpg?itok=PHCvdirn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>co-creator Charlie Cleveland is suing Krafton after his dismissal from Unknown Worlds.</figcaption></figure><p>As a result, although Cleveland says he and his fellow&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>creators would rather not engage in a public battle with Krafton, they feel it's a necessity to make the situation right.</p>

<p>Cleveland also references the $250 million employee bonus that was reportedly to be paid to employees upon reaching a certain revenue goal in 2025 (which the release of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>would obviously have greatly helped).</p>

<p>He says that he, Gill, and McGuire will "continue with the earnout/bonus" and that Unknown Worlds employees "deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands".</p>

<p>As with many corporate lawsuits, this one is likely to run and run, so it's probably going to be quite some time before we hear the result of Cleveland's efforts. He does, however, say that the details of the lawsuit "should eventually become (at least mostly) public", so that information will be revealed in time.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently slated for an Early Access release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in 2026, although whether this lawsuit changes that or not remains to be seen. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Except, in what looks like quite a twist since the 1985 film, the new trailer suggests this one might actually be <em>about</em> Red Sonja.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,196406,197589" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Movies go through all sorts of strange phases—strings of cartoons about sentient fish, for instance—but resurrecting classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movies from the 1980s, but without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is one of the weirdest.</p><p> First we have (the truly soulless-looking) <em>The Running Man</em> coming from Edgar Wright later this year, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD18ddeFuyM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD18ddeFuyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently released a trailer</a></span> showing the empty frame of Glen Powell blandly running and ducking while the direction declared “THIS IS EXTREMELY FUNNY,” and yet at no point was there the appearance of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2SPgPBSrFZ0?si=TZ5M9tJ9gVNA7gge&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2SPgPBSrFZ0?si=TZ5M9tJ9gVNA7gge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a man dressed as a Christmas tree</a></span>. And now we have <em>Red Sonja</em>? It was weird enough in 2012 when the never-climactic Len Wiseman (<em>Underworld</em>, <em>Ballerina</em>) thought it a good idea to try to remake perfect cinematic classic <em>Total Recall</em>, with a stunningly miscast Colin Farrell playing Douglas Quaaaaaiiiiid.</p><figure id="" data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Millennium Films / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>The Running Man</em>, which has a big-name director and main star, <em>Red Sonja</em>’s 2025 revision is perhaps a little more low-key. It’s directed by M. J. Bassett, who has a healthy credit sheet when it comes to directing solid television shows (including four episodes of the wonderful <em>Ash Vs Evil Dead</em>), but she perhaps has a slightly less impressive record on the big screen. Remember 2020's Megan Fox vehicle <em>Rogue</em>? No? How about 2021's <em>Endangered Species</em>, starring Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell? That slipped by you too? But even critics didn’t see those films, so what about a movie that did get reviewed? 2012's <em>Silent Hill: Revelation 3D</em>? That had Malcolm McDowell, Sean Bean, Carrie-Anne Moss and Kit Harrington! And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Metascore of 16</a></span>. Ouch.</p><p>It’s not exactly an all-star cast, either. Sonja herself is played by Matilda Lutz (<em>Rings</em>, <em>Magpie</em>), and the only other names I recognize are Trevor Eve and Rhona Mitra, and that’s because I’m British. Meanwhile, Arnie’s character from Richard Fleischer’s 1985 movie, Kalidor, doesn’t appear to be in the film at all!</p><p>You know what, that’s probably a good thing. As hilariously dreadful as Arnie was in absolutely everything, seeing someone else trying to reprise one of his roles is always so awkward. It was very much his scenery-chewing, bicep-popping, terrible-acting ways that made him so completely charming, and everyone else just seems like a cardboard cutout when stood in his shoes. And, rather crucially, a film about Red Sonja really ought to have been about Red Sonja, but even as early as then, Arnie’s star power made him the focus throughout. Things look very different this time out.</p><p>And yes, sure, it looks like absolute gibberish, but I’m totally here for it. There is perhaps rather a lot of “BUT SHE’S DOING IT EVEN THOUGH SHE’S A GIRL!” energy throughout the trailer, but that’s still better than Brigitte Nielsen fighting to ever actually appear on screen as the main character. </p><p>The source material was written by Robert E. Howard, he of <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> fame, and while he was a giant old racist, he was also an advocate of presenting powerful female characters. That leaves me hopeful that under M. J. Bassett’s helm, we can at least see Sonja be a more significant brute.</p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that Fleischer’s version was absolutely bloody awful! He may have given us <em>Soylent Green</em> (1973) and <em>Fantastic Voyage</em> (1966), but they couldn’t all be bangers. It was deservedly mauled on release, with Gene Siskel handing it a single star in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. But try telling that to teenage me, watching it with mates, swigging from painfully cheap two-liter plastic bottles of cider.</p><p>The new movie doesn’t have a release date yet, beyond being some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/red-sonja-arnold-schwarzenegger-bassett-movie-trailer-1851786097]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">When Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4's roster was first revealed, one notable name was conspicuous in its absence: Bam Margera, one of the most famous skaters of the era who appeared in multiple Tony Hawk games, was the only one from THPS 3's original roster missing from the remake. Margera was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bam-margera-officially-returning-for-tony-hawk-pro-skater-34/1100-6531423/">eventually added to the game</a> in the 11th hour, and in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-return-of-bam-margera-iconic-skate-star-talks-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-thug-and-more/" rel="nofollow ">new interview with VGC</a>, Margera says a chance encounter with Tony Hawk in Los Angeles is the reason he's back in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Margera says that he was in LA at a time where he hadn't spoken with Hawk in about a year, when Margera "wasn’t doing too good." After a phone call and an invitation to the Hawk's Nest skate park, Margera says Hawk was impressed with his progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxow97z1h_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uxow97z1h_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I grabbed my skateboard, put on some knee pads, and we wound up ollieing over each other on the big channel," Margera said in the interview. "He’s like, 'What is going on? You are back.'" Margera explains that he recently married a stretch coach who has helped him improve his physical health, which has allowed him to return to skateboarding full-time.</p><p dir="ltr">"He was pretty blown away by that," Margera said. "And I think that, you know, really provoked him to make a call to Activision, knowing that there was already a deadline, but to see what kind of strings he could pull to get me back in it. Just from that special little visit."</p><p dir="ltr">Bam Margera joins a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 roster that also includes a mixture of new and legendary skaters, with names like Zion Wright, Margie Didal, Bob Burnquist, and Tony Hawk himself included in the mix. A few guests also appear as playable skaters, including the Doom Slayer from id Software's first-person shooter Doom and Michaelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p dir="ltr">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The week has built itself into another UK heatwave, and while I know some people will be loving all the sun, I’m honestly a little bit over all the heatwaves we’ve had this summer. I wouldn’t mind getting back to a bit of slightly drizzly misery for a few weeks. Either way, we’ve been able to stay out of the weather and play plenty of games.</p>
<p>Since previewing the game a little while ago, I’ve been continuing my ground-slapping adventure in Donkey Kong Bananza, which you’ll hear all about when the review embargo lifts before launch next week. I’ve also joined <strong>Miguel</strong> for some tactical SWAT action in Ready or Not… which you’ll also hear about when embargo lifts next week.</p>
<p>So let’s move on rather swiftly from all that secretive stuff and pay a visit to <strong>Steve’s </strong>den of gaming. He’s been playing FromSoftware classic Ninja Blade, initially starting with a German edition of the game before finding the German text unworkable and switching to an English version. “It’s not a good game,” he says, “but by God its one of the most video gamey games to ever game. You haven’t lived until you’ve played a FromSoft game in which a ninja called Ken pulls off a sick kick flip on a missile in mid air.”</p>

<p>He also played through all the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/gex-trilogy-review-the-joy-of-gex/">Gex Trilogy</a> games, dabbled with ReCore to meet his Xbox Rewards box-ticking, and started Space Marine 2 with his co-op buddies, which is “satisfyingly visceral”.</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> journey into Switch 2 gaming has seen him playing more Mario Kart World and being impressed by the update to Pokémon Violet – “I can’t stress enough that it’s still not a great game, but at least it works now.” That really was one of the most transformative free Switch 2 patches, I agree.</p>
<p>For <strong>Aran</strong>, he’s been finding Wild Hearts a more relaxed take on the Monster Hunter formula, while Ade has been playing some Eternal Strands, with awesome boss battles wrapped up in by-the-numbers exploration and combat. Oh, and he’s started to review Wuchang: Fallen Feathers which, true to its name, has an awful lot of feathers in it.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> game Blue Prince a try, but “while I like the concept there’s a bit too much cerebral busywork going on. My current casual gaming habits don’t exactly dovetail with roguelike puzzlers that require a healthy attention span and copious notetaking.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been enjoying Islanders: New Shores, which is a city-builder that’s brought some zen state relaxation to her life. “I’ve never reached the top of a gaming leaderboard before so I felt I’d achieved a (slightly sad) life-goal by becoming no.1 on the Islanders: New Shores worldwide leaderboard. It only lasted so long as I was competing with the small number of other pre-release gamers, but I’ll take it!”</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has had a bundle of very different games on the go, with the rhythm-action warfare of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a> getting that game’s chanting lodged in his game once more, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/">Ra Ra Boom</a> having some real beat ’em up potential.</p>

<p>And we’ll wrap things up with <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who played Chains of Freedom and then waves his arms around for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/maestro-review/">Maestro’s</a> review. He’s also played “an ungodly amount of Terraria with three mods that are so big I needed a fourth mod to get them to work together. And then twenty more mods. Then two more mods to improve storage and expand my inventory because there’s so much loot. It’s fantastic.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this past week?</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/704560/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-nintendo-switch-2-comparison</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-tony-hawk-remaster-is-a-good-sign-for-switch-2-ports.1241436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the pleasant surprises of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2 launch</a> was how well the hardware managed big games <em>not</em> made by Nintendo. It’s something the company’s underpowered consoles have often struggled with, but the Switch 2 is a good place to play technical showpieces like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> — though that originally debuted in 2020. <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4,</em> which is launching simultaneously on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and both versions of the Switch, makes for an interesting test case of what’s possible on the Switch 2 with a <em>new</em> game. I’ve been playing it on both the PS5 and Switch 2, and from what I’ve seen, the remake bodes well for the future of Nintendo’s newest console.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the latest <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> is a sequel of sorts. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">In 2020, Activision released a remaster of the original two games in the iconic series</a>, maintaining the tone and structure but also modernizing the experience with updated graphics and controls, online features, and an expanded cast featuring the current generation of skateboarding stars. It did a remarkable job of keeping the best parts of the games while also making them feel current. <em><em>THPS3+4</em> </em>does the same thing, but for the third and fourth entries in the series. There aren’t too many surprises if you’ve played the original, though <em>THPS4</em> has a more rigid structure compared to the open-ended nature of the original version.</p><p>Performance is an important aspect of any skateboarding game. These titles are all about linking tricks together in creative ways, which can be hard to do when the game chugs or the frame rate stutters. So the thing that struck me the most with the Switch 2 version is just how smooth it is. It may sound boring, but the best part about it is that it just works. I haven’t experienced any technical issues in handheld mode, and that’s true whether playing in a simple indoor stage or something more elaborate, like the light-up show that is the Tokyo course from <em>THPS3</em>.</p><p>It seems that the developers at Iron Galaxy — who have taken over the series after the original studio, Vicarious Visions, unceremoniously became a Blizzard studio — prioritized substance over style, and it was the right choice. <em>THPS3+4</em> looks fine on the Switch 2, but the main difference you’ll notice on a platform like the PS5 is how much more detailed everything is. The backdrops feel more lively, though you might not notice it so much as you’re speeding through levels. The biggest difference is the characters. On the PS5, skaters like Tony Hawk and Aori Nishimura look like themselves; on the Switch 2, they’re slightly blurry approximations of their real-world counterparts.</p><p>The differences between platforms are largely cosmetic, though, which makes them much easier to tolerate, even in a genre where style is an incredibly important part of the experience. I’ll note that the various decks and clothes you can unlock still look pretty good on the Switch 2, so it’s not like you’re totally sacrificing the cool skater vibes. More importantly, <em>THPS</em> has always been an excellent series to play on the go — the Game Boy Advance iterations of the franchise have no right being as good as they are — and that remains true here, where the short runs are perfectly suited for portable play.</p><p>That being said, while <em>THPS3+4</em> is a good showcase for the Switch 2, it’s not exactly a “next-gen” game. It’s a rare experience that was built to span multiple generations of hardware from all the major platform holders. So it’s not exactly a sign that <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> or other tentpole blockbusters will make their way to the Switch 2. But the latest <em>Tony Hawk</em> game at least shows that the console won’t always be left behind when it comes to the newest releases.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/704560/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-nintendo-switch-2-comparison]]></content:encoded>

This setting can completely change how passing works in CFB 26, so you'll want to understand which one you're picking.</p><p>If you want a rundown of the best Passing Mechanics settings to select, take a look below:</p><ul><li><strong>Passing Type</strong>: Placement &amp; Accuracy</li><li><strong>Passing Slowdown</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Pass Lead Increase</strong>: Small</li><li><strong>Reticle Speed</strong>: 12-14</li><li><strong>Reticle Visibility</strong>: User Only</li><li><strong>Meter Visibility</strong>: User Only</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022"></a><figcaption>The Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg"></figure><p>For starters, the <strong>Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to be the best overall Passing Type</strong> you can use in CFB 26. The other options are: Placement, Classic Passing, and Revamped Passing. By default, you'll have Revamped Passing selected, which is a new spin on Classic Passing that allows for more control over the arc of passes. If you have an accurate quarterback, you can more accurately place balls where a receiver needs them to be to make a catch.</p><p>While you can stick with the shiny new Revamped Passing setting, Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to give you the most precision when it comes to throwing the ball. This adds a timing element to passing that allows you to make perfectly accurate passes on bullet passes. You'll also see some visual aids on screen that make it simpler to control a ball's placement and power. Placement &amp; Accuracy makes it easy to throw every kind of pass in CFB 26 as long as you understand how to use it correctly. If you want a new experience compared to CFB 25, though, you can stick with Revamped Passing and learn the new form of passing that EA's introduced.</p><p>Moving on, <strong>Passing Slowdown should always remain off</strong>, as there's no real need to have a slowdown during a pass. You'll also want <strong>Pass Lead Increase set to "small."</strong> What this does is give you a smaller window to lead receivers, which is what you want. You don't want to lead receivers too much when throwing a pass, as this can result in the ball getting outside their catch radius. If that happens, the pass will either fall incomplete or head the other way in a defender's hands.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Reticle Speed option</strong> is a personal preference: We found the <strong>12-14 range to be a sweet spot</strong>. However, if you want the reticle to move slower or faster, you can adjust it accordingly. The last two settings, <strong>Reticle Visibility</strong> and <strong>Meter Visibility</strong>, don't matter much; you can just leave them set to User Only.</p><p>That does it for the Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26. There's not much to them, but subtle changes can have a massive impact on your gameplay.

		<p>Kayak VR: Mirage, as we noted in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/21/kayak-vr-mirage-psvr-2-review/">our original review</a>, is a rather minimalist experience. Sure, there’s a competitive mode where you can race against ghosts of other players, but you can also just jump in a Kayak and pootle around some stunningly gorgeous locations and relax. In his review, Stefan also commented, “For me, though, I was left wanting something more […] a kayak slalom in the whitewater rapids.” It appears developers Better Than Life – who win all the points for that Red Dwarf VR reference – were listening, as that’s exactly what you get in the Yucatán DLC pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kayak VR: Mirage - Yucatán DLC (including whitewater) | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAAGWaM0Fxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The level begins in a lagoon surrounded on all sides by high cliffs that are covered in tropical vegetation. It is stunning to look at; I have been lucky enough to go to places like this and it does feel real with birds flying around and fish swimming under your kayak. As I was playing this in London during a heatwave, I was suitably hot and humid as well. Sadly, this gorgeous location is not indicative of what you get to play as the rest of the level is set in caves and an old mine.</p>



<p>The first section is very sedate and has you paddling through a few tunnels, ducking down now and then to avoid the cave roof, before things open up into a large cavern full of stalactites and stalagmites, all of which are lit by glowworms crawling up the walls. It’s very pretty and looks like something from a fantasy game, but a quick paddle sees you heading into more caves, which gradually turn into tunnels from an old mine. There’s almost a puzzle element to this section as you paddle through a maze with rockfalls crashing down around you, blocking what seems to be the obvious route.</p>

<p>Eventually the tunnels widen out to another larger cave and the water begins to flow faster, pushing you forward and into, you you guessed it, more tunnels! As the pace picks up have to be alert as the game throws all sorts of obstacles at you, narrowing the passages so you have to lean to squeeze through and even that video game staple, giant fans blade that slice through the water. However, as the game is rated E for Everyone, don’t expect a gory decapitation if you smash in to a slicing blade, you just bump off and can have another try.</p>

<p>And that’s about it. It’s a short and sweet experience, twenty minutes from end to end if you paddle at a decent pace. There’s a time attack mode where you can race ghosts of other players and a tour mode in which you can sit back and let the Kayak navigate itself through the map, the same as the other maps in game.</p>
<p>The cave system is completely different to other locations in the game, which are all set in wide open areas, and this change adds some variety to your paddling, but it does mean you don’t get the majestic views found in other locations. You also have to rely on a head mounted torch for some sections and, like all torches in all video games, it’s weaker than a cup of tea made by an American.</p>
<p>The Yucatán DLC is definitely worth a look if you already own Kayak VR: Mirage as it does bring something new to the game, but I think I preferred some of the other locations which were less enclosed and allowed you to marvel at how gorgeous VR can look.</p>

<p>With Switch 2 now hosting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur</a> and the like, have you got a case of GameCube fever? If so, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/misc_a_tiny_tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a> might be just the soothing ointment you need to apply generously all over your body. Lead developer Michael Pearce has said it was inspired by the games of his youth, and it only takes a glance at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/misc-a-tiny-tale-will-fill-the-chibi-robo-sized-hole-in-your-heart-this-july">the trailer</a> to see that those games must surely have included GameCube favourites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo!</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. Taking that retro inspiration, Misc is a 3D platformer featuring a teeny-weeny robot bobbling about and helping people in a quirky post-human world.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157198/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The debut release from Tinyware Games, Misc was made by a core team of three, winning funding from the Australian government along the way. It was developed for Nintendo Switch (which is the version reviewed here) and PC but, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/misc-a-tiny-tale-looks-super-smooth-on-switch-2-thanks-to-a-dev-hunch">as reported on Nintendo Life last month</a>, Tinyware took a punt on Switch 2’s approach to backwards compatibility, meaning the new console does deliver a significant boost in graphics and performance – but more on that later.</p>
<p>The story revolves around an inch-tall robot named Buddy and his friend Bag Boy – a unicycle robot with a paper bag on his head. One day, they hear an explosion in their little garden village, then set out on an adventure to find out what it was. As they go, they visit other locales peppered with friendly robo-characters to lend a hand to, run errands for, or trade with.</p>
<p>As simple as the story is, it’s nice to go on a quest just because something went bang, not because the world’s ending again – and it doesn’t hold back on throwing in some dramatic moments later on. This is supported well by the music, which has a storybook quality, some eerie moments, and even a few songs for the emotional peaks.</p>
<p>Each village area you visit on Buddy’s odyssey has a locked exit gate and a scattering of collectibles. There’s not too many — no collectathon trinket fixation here — and they’re split between major golden cogs and minor metal nuts. The metal nuts are more plentiful, left in short trails to nudge you around the level, while the golden cogs are the keys to opening the gates. Each area has ten cogs, with eight required for progression. A little icing on that quite appetising collectibles cake is a feel-good "Difference Made" system (think Chibi-Robo’s Happy Points) which counts up your positive influence on the world as you potter about litter-picking and scrubbing goop.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157195/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But collecting golden cogs is the backbone of the game. You mainly get them either by completing tasks for NPCs — find a shiny trinket or complete a set of sheet music — or by performing daring feats of platforming and exploration. The platforming is all low-stakes stuff — there are no lives to lose or anything like that — but when you fall, you will be left having to retrace your steps, which can sometimes be a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>Alongside some retrying, the jump-feel takes a bit of getting used to. It’s floaty by design, with Buddy having a propeller on his head to extend his air time, and the camera will need plenty of manual nudging to get sight of both where you’re aiming and where your drop shadow’s going. It was a good decision on Tinyware’s part to put the most challenging jumping in separate underground sections — one on each level — without any golden cogs riding on it. Tucking the 'real' platforming away in break-outs like this reminded me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>’s wooden-block courses – another GameCube reminiscence.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157201/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While we’re on the subject of controls, there are duck and dive manoeuvres that are almost never needed, as if they’d been forgotten, and a stamina gauge to throttle your sprinting that just seemed unnecessary to me. Misc does control well once you’ve clicked with it, but these details make it feel just a little bit baggy.</p>
<p>Most of the action happens in outdoor settings a bit reminiscent of Pikmin. However, a graphical comparison with Switch contemporary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is not <em>especially</em> flattering. The environments are varied, particularly later in the game, although they sometimes seem a little barren. While most levels don’t feel like places characters might actually live, their charm and creativity still come through.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Switch isn’t doing the game any favours: it simply can’t render the game at its best. Resolution is low, and distant assets are hard to make out, with a lot of shimmering. The default setting for focus blur is a little heavy-handed — not so much Vaseline on the lens as a custard pie — obscuring anything at a distance and making it hard to get your bearings. Once I discovered I could turn the blur off, it didn’t go back on – for simple playability more than aesthetics.</p>
<figure><a title="Misc. A Tiny Tale Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157200/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And that little bit of navigation help was really needed in some villages. I eventually managed to frame the levels around distinctive landmarks, but scouring places for the last couple of cogs sometimes led to walking — albeit rather cutely — in circles. As I climbed up the same stack of buckets for the fourteenth time, even Bag Boy starting giving me funny looks. Add some invisible walls and blocked gaps that look like you could go through them, and more than once I was ready to move on before having the required cogs.</p>
<p>A test on Switch 2 told a different story altogether. The resolution at distance is great, movement is much smoother, and load times are shorter. I still preferred to have the blur turned off, but the ability to survey levels properly from high vantage points helped no end in finding my way around. Again, though, it’s the Switch 1 'version' under review here.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Misc. A Tiny Tale is a charming and delightful first effort from Tinyware – albeit with some wobbles in execution. It sticks very close to classic ideas and struggles with graphical fidelity on Switch, but none of that can undo the charm of the characters and the retro vibe straight from the GameCube era. Until Chibi-Robo hits Nintendo Classics, this will serve all your miniature robot helper needs.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.</em></p><p><em>It's been awfully hot in various parts of Remap Country these days, and honestly, there's really nothing worse than trying to sleep through a layer of sweat. (Patrick is the only one who can just crank up the ol' AC.)</em></p><p><em>But even in "ideal" conditions, sleep does not always come easy. Maybe your brain can't turn off. Or, as Rob has dealt with throughout the week, your leg is throbbing with pain. Not exactly what one would call ideal. </em></p><p><em>Hopefully you're reading this after a good night's rest. But if not? Well, Rob and Patrick have plenty of stories about the nature of sleep.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I am, generally, a sound sleeper. Once I’m out, I’m out. I can’t nap for shit, a grace only granted by my body when all other options have been exhausted. (This happened most recently while flying from Chicago to Los Angeles for Summer Game Fest following an intense family wedding, in which I downed an entire cup of McDonalds coffee, only to pass out for two hours.)</p><p>But when I can’t sleep, I get fidgety. I twist, turn. I think about looking at my phone. I wonder if having a new, cooler pillow would help. Maybe if I drank a glass of water? Oh, it must be because I’ve started going to the bathroom more often in my early 40s, so I should go pee.</p><p>Inevitably, this practice disturbs, then awakens, my wife. She does not sleep well. Getting to sleep isn’t the problem—it’s <em>staying</em> asleep. Her brain doesn’t enter a zombie state when she wakes up at 2am. Instead, it’s time to get up for the day and start thinking about all the problems, issues, and tensions coming. Did you remember to make the kids lunch for school?</p><p>Our evening routine these days usually goes like this:</p><ul><li>Feed the children, then feed ourselves</li><li>Watch something on TV with the kids</li><li>Give the children a little bit of independent tablet time</li><li>Start the (increasingly long) bedtime routine for both children</li><li>Hang out on the couch with one another, preferably with a short TV episode</li><li>My wife heads to bed, while I play video games for an hour or two</li><li>I head to bed, slowly closing the bathroom door to hide my toothbrush buzzing</li></ul><p>When the Switch came out, my wife wondered if this portable wonder could solve the problem of us not sleeping together during weekdays. She asked if I could try playing in bed as she dozed off. Within minutes, she turned over and asked “Do you have to press the buttons <em>that</em> hard?” Needless to say, the experiment did not last more than a night. I, uh, now play on the couch.</p><p>A few years back, we added bunk beds to my oldest daughter’s room. She was excited to share a room with her sister, but in reality, that second bed became the place I went to when I was having a restless night, feeling sick, etc. Like I said, I sleep pretty well and am thankful for that, but on nights where it <em>wasn’t</em> going my way, the last thing I wanted to do was ruin the upcoming day for the other person, too. And generally speaking, a bed “reset” would often do the trick for me, because I could remove the anxiety of disrupting my partner and focus on relaxing myself.</p><p>Just this past year, though, we swapped the bunk beds for a loft bed, aka the one where the bed sits high and there’s a desk underneath. It’s super popular with kids these days, especially since that’s a spot to store all their various electronics and whatever. Cool! Loft bed seems neat. But it also saw the death of my 2nd bed, which means my only outlet for crashing on a rough night is the couch. And look, we spend decent money on both couches, but they are not bed quality!</p><p>My youngest has asked to inherit the bunk beds, but putting them back together is <em>such</em> a pain in the ass. I told her we could talk about it when she turns six next year. And as much as I’m not excited for all the (re)building, I gotta say I’d be really happy to have that other bed back again.</p><p>I know that you’re working through a leg injury at the moment. Some of my worst nights have been while working through the cycling pain and anxiety of recovery. How’s your bed situation?&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@dreadpiratekato?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kate Stone Matheson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>My left leg is cursed. I talked about my ACL surgery in high school. A few years ago I had to have tendon surgery because I was headed toward a rupture due to some bone spurs in my heel, so that laid me up for about four or five weeks. Fortunately <em>Destiny: The Taken King </em>had just come out so I mostly spent that month in a fugue playing <em>Destiny </em>on my couch. Now I have an almighty bruise from tripping on an ottoman (and landing on the edge of said ottoman with my shin). The musculature in the two legs is completely different, which makes finding pants a fun issue even setting aside my weight and height. Anyway, right now it’s about three times larger than my other leg with swelling, and if I don’t keep it elevated, it starts throbbing in a way that starts as mildly irritating and swiftly becomes borderline excruciating. Especially at night.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the better things to have occurred in recent years is the rise of the Itch.io protest bundles. Millions of dollars have been raised for various vital causes through the generosity of developers throwing in games by their hundreds, in deals that have done incredible work to not only make money, but also generate noise about these issues. The latest, already at $40,000 after a day, is No ICE in California, where $10 will get you an astonishing 560 games, 427 of which are table-top RPGs.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,197586,196599" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Other recent Itch fundraisers have included 2020's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/itch-io-is-selling-a-bundle-of-over-700-games-for-5-t-1843936605?_gl=1*140k7j0*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyMzEyMzUkbzQkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDA1MDYkajIwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-is-selling-a-bundle-of-over-700-games-for-5-t-1843936605?_gl=1*140k7j0*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyMzEyMzUkbzQkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDA1MDYkajIwJGwwJGgw">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a></span> which raised an extraordinary $8.1 million for Black Lives Matter-related charities, and 2022's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bundle for Ukraine</a></span>, that brought in over $6.3 million.

Its modest goal is set at $50,000, which it’s already very close to reaching. Hopefully, as more attention is gained, and more developers throw in, that target can be absolutely smashed, not least because of the urgent need for help for LA immigrants facing ICE invasions.</p><h2 id="h90273"><a id=""></a>What should I play in this bundle?</h2><p>But what are you getting for ten bucks? Isn’t everything on Itch a scratchy PS1-style horror game set in the cells of an invasive bacteria, played using cutlery-based inputs? Pshah—get away with your needlessly cruel yet accurate parodying. Instead, here you have things like <em>Periphery Synthetic</em>, an “interactive musical experience” played in a procedurally generated planetary system. I set this up to be a joke, because yeah, the bundle is packed with bonkers esoteric gaming, but dammit this game looks amazing. You synthesize new abilities through exploration in this super-lo-fi experience which will eventually let you “command these worlds in every dimension.”</p><p>...</p><p>Er, sorry, you lost me there for a bit. I’ve been playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Periphery Synthetic</strong></em></a></span>, and I absolutely love it. I got wheels! And I just improved my climbing ability. And I’m obsessed with how you can have an open-world game with the fidelity of a <em>Ghosts of Yotei</em>, and yet here just a pattern of squares still manages to evoke an incredible sense of place.</p><p>There’s also Necrosoft’s delightfully bonkers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/gunhouse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/gunhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Gunhouse</em></strong></a></span>, a weird take on a tile matching game, where your dragging rows to create blocks of four tiles, which turn into weapons and ammo used to survive attacks from encroaching enemies. It’s instantly hooky, with a very peculiar aesthetic.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-recommend-id="image://e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1738" data-height="978" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young person talks to a raptor in a baseball cap, pushing a bike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young person talks to a raptor in a baseball cap, pushing a bike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rocket Adrift Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-recommend-id="image://e4a14bf47ead16d331a8108ef6c2c74b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1738" data-height="978" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young person talks to a raptor in a baseball cap, pushing a bike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But perhaps today is a day for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rocketadrift.itch.io/raptor-boyfriend-a-high-school-romance&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rocketadrift.itch.io/raptor-boyfriend-a-high-school-romance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance</strong></em></a></span>, Rocket Adrift’s dating sim about—no, actually, you’re wrong! It’s not about dating dinosaurs. It’s that, but also dating a fairy and a sasquatch. Also, there is a vengeful ghost. And that dino? That’s Robert, a velociraptor, and he wears his baseball cap <em>backward</em>. Yup, it’s the ‘90s, and you’re at a high school for cryptids, so get sharing mix tapes, staring at stars, and smooching the beasts.</p><p>There’s also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://square2mom.itch.io/valiant&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://square2mom.itch.io/valiant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>(Val)iant</strong></em></a></span>, a game about being an 18-year-old non-binary teen with “a broken vag.” It’s a superb piece of fiction that immediately puts you in the position of being someone “struggling with their relationship to their body,” beginning in a doctor’s office as you try to explain your physical pain during sex, but are faced with a bombardment of assumptions about your gender, your self-perception, and your goals. It’s incredibly open and honest, straightforward about straightforward topics, and explores subjects that I’d never otherwise have to consider in my straight, male life. Just an incredible tool for empathy, as well as a fantastically written game.</p><h2 id="h90274"><a id=""></a>Fill my table tops</h2><p>However, the real focus of this particular bundle is table-top gaming. There are a whopping 96 games in there for your ten dollars, so no worries if that’s not your sort of thing, but the 427 TTRPGs should at least give you cause to investigate.</p><p>This isn’t my area of expertise either, but I can tell you what’s intriguing me.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://titanomachyrpg.itch.io/nighthawks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://titanomachyrpg.itch.io/nighthawks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Nighthawks</strong></em></a></span> is a 3-6 player game based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks_(Hopper)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks_(Hopper)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the painting by Edward Hopper</a></span>. I mean, that’s interesting enough right there. What makes it even more fascinating is that this game which requires a group of people to be together is exploring loneliness. Each person takes on a person who might appear in the painting, deciding among yourselves what kind of place this diner is, what sorts of relationships you might have between you. The GM-free game leaves players exploring the topic of loneliness together, choosing whether they might succumb or battle against it. It sounds incredible.</p><figure id="" data-id="868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-recommend-id="image://868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1070" data-height="279" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pinayu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-recommend-id="image://868ead78603ff72ad62d4f9870d51ba2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1070" data-height="279" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Helan logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Solo TTPRGs are an aspect of the genre that I constantly forget can be a thing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pinayu.itch.io/helan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pinayu.itch.io/helan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Helan</strong></em></a></span> is one such example, where you play as a person who spends their life accompanying those who visit the white sands of Helan in order to help them reach their destinations. It’s a road trip, one about relationships with strangers, and a world-building game where the conversations you choose define the world around you. Oh, and you have a hoverbike. The game comes with print-outs of a 16-page booklet that tells you how to play, and all the information you need, along with a two-page guide filled with 108 travelers you can accompany as you play.</p><p>God there are so many games about being a dad. But there are so damn few about being a mom. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floaker.itch.io/mum-chums&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floaker.itch.io/mum-chums" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Mum Chums</em></strong></a></span>, however, is “a slice of life RPG about people who care for kids.” You don’t have to be a mom—any adult carer can be portrayed—but the game states it’s specifically written from a “white Scottish perspective.” The game begins when your kids are about to start school, with no winning or losing, but rather roleplaying a specific part of life. The game is still in development, but fully playable.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floaker.itch.io/be-seeing-you&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floaker.itch.io/be-seeing-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Be Seeing You</em></strong></a></span> is a 3-5 player (or “prisoner”) game about our dystopian surveillance culture. There’s no GM and no dice, but rather a <em>Prisoner</em>-inspired exploration of the infiltrating nature of capitalism. Outside of this bundle, you can buy the game for $13, or just download it for free because “Digital media should be freely available.” Developer Tanya Floaker then encourages people to upload and share the files with others as much as they wish.</p><h2 id="h90275"><a id=""></a>Where is the money going?</h2><p>The money raised is being split between two charities working with U.S. immigrants affected by the brutal and despicable actions of ICE. The first is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.immdef.org/support&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.immdef.org/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Immigrant Defenders Law Center</strong></a></span>, a law firm created in 2015 by immigration lawyers, looking to defend people faced with deportation, but also to bring about systemic change to the grim system. Of course, the people ImmDef works with are rarely in a position to be able to pay for legal representation, so this non-profit provides always-free services and is sustained by donations. They also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.immdef.org/shop&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.immdef.org/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have merch</a></span>!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://raicestexas.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://raicestexas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RAICES</strong></a></span> also offers legal services for families looking to make the U.S. their home. It provides a broad range of services, either free or low-cost, in many parts of Texas, and again is reliant on donations to continue its work. And why a Texan organization given the Californian nature of this bundle? That’s because a lot of the people ICE targets in LA are then forcibly taken to Texas.</p><p>So, you know, even if you pay the $10 (or as much as you want to give) and then forget you ever did, you’ve made an important difference. But you’ve also got an enormous trove of games and table-top RPGs to explore for months to come.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085]]></content:encoded>
