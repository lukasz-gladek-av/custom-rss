			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/s5teaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Embark Studios announced</a> that Season 5 of THE FINALS will be launching on December 12. In this season, there will be a new map, gadgets, weapons, social clubs and sponsors to help spice up the game. This season takes players to the mountainside town of Bernal, which is home to one of the biggest monoliths in the world. This arena features historic cobblestone streets with a vibrant and colorful colonial plaza as the centerpiece of the map. Players will be able to leap across rooftops to find secrets in the nooks and crannies of the map while fighting for survival against their opponents. There are destructible environments to add to the spectacle of the fight, allowing you to strip away Bernal's historic charm and instead turn it into a bullet-ridden ruin.</p>
<p>Embark Studios has released a new trailer for the upcoming season, so that you can see what you can expect from the new season in THE FINALS on December 12.</p>
<p><iframe title="THE FINALS | Season 5 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9TekVsp_UE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This season also adds a new way for players to connect with each other. The feature is called Clubs, and is a social system that is inspired by real sports teams. Regardless of whether you're playing solo or you're in a squad, Clubs allow new ways for players to connect with each other, collaborate, or compete. By utilizing Clubs, Contestants can work together to complete challenges as a team using Club Contracts. This will allow you to earn XP and fans, or you can use Team-Up Requests to find teammates for your preferred game mode.</p>
<p>That's not all that players can expect to see in THE FINALS Season 5, as there are some new weapons, including the ShAK-12 and Cerberus 12GA, weapons for the Heavy and Medium classes respectively. Along with weapons being added, there are some new Gadgets, including the Gravity Vortex and Lockbolt Launcher, for the Light and Heavy classes, respectively.</p>
<p>Fan favorite sponsor ISEUL-T returns to Season 5 of THE FINALS, and two brand-new sponsors, DISSUN and VAIYA, join the roster of sponsors. This season, THE FINALS launches on PlayStation 4 for the first time, allowing a whole new audience to experience the game that weren't able to previously. Of course, while there are new items and features being added, Embark Studios has also worked on balancing the game and weapons as needed while adding quality-of-life improvements. Players can now expect support for a 120Hz mode on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series</a> X, allowing those on the console to experience the new season of THE FINALS in a smoother performance.</p>

            <p>When I downloaded <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creeper-world">Creeper World</a> IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-so-very-ed-special-creeper-world">dates back to the age of Gillen</a>. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-creeper-worlds-decade-long-evolution-keeps-getting-harder">interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019</a> - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4</a>, the first 3D instalment.</p>
<p>What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. </p><!--more-->

<p>Hopefully, we will do the aforesaid terraforming while cleverly opening passages to our mission objectives, such as power cores and hibernation pods. It's important to pare away the rock and soil deviously, even artistically - to wield the terraforming shovel like the finest of paintbrushes. But going by my 20 minutes with said demo, there's always the temptation to scrub your cursor back and forth and eradicate the layout, like a child losing patience with an Etch-A-Sketch. Up yours, fluid physics! We will find harmony in our mutual devastation. There will be no World for the Creeper to conquer.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I'm delighted by this. It makes the factional "asymmetries" of other real-time strategy games look desperately unambitious. The Zerg could learn a thing or two from the Creeper.</p>
<p>While it's labelled real-time strategy, the game often feels closer to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>, the action-RPG where you spend half the time getting melted by accidentally excavated lakes of acid. There's a similar joy in the arcane applications of particle, sand and fluid physics, with certain combinations of terrain material proving... volatile. Fingers crossed that Creeper World IXE involves teleportation, somehow.</p>
<p>Here's a feature sheet from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2257010/Creeper_World_IXE/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sand physics terrain where every pixel is simulated allowing the use of gravity and terrain as part of your strategy</p>
<p>Enhanced Creeper fluid simulation with waves creating new Creeper behaviour</p>
<p>Particle system for new and greater threats</p>
<p>Use terrain chemistry and terraforming to gain the advantage over your enemy</p>
<p>Extensive custom unit support with scripting where the community can craft their units, missions and control modules.</p>
<p>Online map database for endless fun and new challenges</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd normally end a piece like this by offering some more direct comparisons, but what can I compare Creeper World to, aside from Noita? <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/from-dust">From Dust</a>? If you know of a parallel, I'd love to hear about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nes-famicom-tetris-nintendo-switch-online-1851712262<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is adding a steady flow of classic games to its Switch Online platform, from the most obvious to the most obscure, but perhaps never something as significant as the NES version of <em>Tetris</em>. Why such a big deal? Because not only will this be the very first time the game has been made available on <em>any</em> platform since its original release, but it’s <em>the </em>version of <em>Tetris</em> when it comes to the thriving eSports scene.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194328,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The history of <em>Tetris</em> is such an extraordinary tale, so much so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 saw the release of a hit movie based on the events</a></span>. Its earliest years are a tangled confusion of rights and ownership disputes, culminating in its breakthrough Nintendo versions released for the NES and Game Boy in 1989. (The NES release itself is an astonishing tale, with Atari and Nintendo making rival versions, that somehow saw the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vile, pension-stealing human stain, Robert Maxwell</a></span>, trying to convince Mikhail Gorbachev to cancel Nintendo’s contract!)</p><p>Anyhow, that NES version has since never been re-released or made available on any of Nintendo’s subsequent e-stores. Come December 12, that’s going to change, as the game is added to the teetering pile of emulated classics in the Switch Online subscription service.</p><p>The NES version has become enormously popular thanks to its recent prominence in eSports, especially following 2023's extraordinary series of broken world records, as players saw scores previously thought impossible, and the game’s killscreen was reached for the very first time. All of this is exquisitely documented in a YouTube documentary by Summoning Salt, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..">Carolyn Petit wrote about last year</a></span>.</p><p>I swear, I’ve only ever been the most casual <em>Tetris</em> player (although, weirdly, I did once get to have a coffee with Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers), and I found this two-hour doc utterly compelling from start to finish. There are <em>so </em>many twists and turns.</p><p>It’ll be fascinating to see how the Switch Online version fares. Presumably, the scene will judge it very closely, given how competitive players have more recently insisted on playing on an original NES cart for the best results. Or they’ll ignore it entirely because everything they’ve built is based on playing with the original NES controller and the nuances of drumming on its rear. Or, you know, regular people might just enjoy a nice game of one of the best versions of <em>Tetris</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-no-humans-allowed/1900-6417040/" data-ref-id="1900-6417040">Fallout 76</a> dataminers discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-leak-reveals-game-is-probably-getting-a-highly-requested-feature/1100-6524749/" data-ref-id="1100-6524749">camp pets were on the way to the game</a>. Now, as part of the Gleaming Depths update going live today, pets are indeed arriving in the form of a Bombay Cat and a white German Shepherd. And while players can't keep more than one C.A.M.P. pet at a time, they can pet their adorable feline or canine companions.</p><p>The new update is Fallout 76's biggest expansion to date, and also kicks off Season 19: The Scientific Forge. This season is focused on the Enclave, a former "deep-state faction of the United States government" that is now controlled by M.O.D.U.S., an AI supercomputer. M.O.D.U.S. and its followers plan to use science to revitalize the country no matter how many experiments they have to run along the way.</p><p>The arrival of these mad scientists comes with some mad-science weapons including a Tesla Cannon, as well as the Enclave Lab Coat and a M.O.D.U.S. Terminal Vending Machine that can be set up in the player's camp. Some of the other available items include an Enclave Grill Cooking Station and Enclave Hazmat Paint. Players will also be able to use a Plasma Core Recharger instead of buying new plasma cores every time they run out.</p><p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft and Bethesda teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">players will be able to control a Ghoul in 2025</a>. That feature isn't included with the new update, but it's something that's on the update calendar for March 2025 with the start of Season 20. The rest of the details about the Gleaming Depths update are below.</p><h2>MUTATED PUBLIC EVENTS UPDATE</h2><p>We have added five public events to the Mutated Public Events playlist. These events are:</p><ul><li>Campfire Tales: Volatile and Toxic Blood Mutations</li><li>Free Range: Resilient and Swift-Footed Mutations</li><li>Project Paradise: Active Camouflage and Resilient Mutations</li><li>Beasts of Burden: Freezing Touch and Reflective Mutations</li><li>Safe and Sound: Swift-Focused and Danger Cloud Mutations</li></ul><h2>PERK CARDS BALANCING UPDATE</h2><p>The Gleaming Depths update releases with some substantial balancing changes to a handful of Perk Cards.Our goal was to take generally underperforming perks and make them more interesting and easier to incorporate into your builds by removing some extra ranks, lowering the cost, and changing their effect to scale with the related primary stat.</p><ul><li>Adamantium Skeleton  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Limb Damage Reduction effect now scales with Endurance</li></ul></li><li>All Night Long  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Rank 1 Perk Point cost increased from 1 to 2</li><li>New effect: The positive effects of pre-war alcohol last twice as long</li></ul></li><li>Batteries Included  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li><li>Bloodsucker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Moved from Charisma to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 gains the effects of the former Rank 3 effect</li><li>Healing bonus increased from 150% to 200%</li><li>Additional effect: Benefits now also apply to Cannibal</li></ul></li><li>Bullet Shield  <ul><li>Moved from Strength to Endurance</li><li>Added a 4th rank.</li><li>New effect: 5% chance per rank to Deflect ranged attacks for 6 seconds when firing a heavy weapon.</li></ul></li><li>Cannibal  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Increased the healing received and hunger restored at Rank 1</li></ul></li><li>Cap Collector  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Now applies to containers and corpses, not just Cap Stashes</li><li>New effect: The amount of Caps found scales with Luck</li></ul></li><li>Evasive  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Evade Chance based on Agility</li></ul></li><li>First Aid  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Now affects Stimpak Diffuser</li><li>New effect: Stimpak healing scales with Intelligence</li></ul></li><li>Four Leaf Clover  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Misses in VATS contribute to the Critical Meter based on Luck</li></ul></li><li>Hard Bargain  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Rank 1 now grants +7 Charisma while bartering with NPCs</li></ul></li><li>Iron Stomach  <ul><li>Now also increases Energy Resistance</li></ul></li><li>Junk Shield  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Now works while in Power Armor</li><li>Additional effect: Now also scales with Luck</li></ul></li><li>Lifegiver  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Improves HP gained from Endurance</li></ul></li><li>Lone Wanderer  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: AP Regen and defense bonus based on Charisma</li></ul></li><li>Natural Resistance  <ul><li>No longer increases Energy Resistance</li></ul></li><li>Night Eyes  <ul><li>Removed requirement for the time of day</li></ul></li><li>Ordnance Express  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li><li>Pharmacist  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Radiation healing scales with Intelligence</li><li>No longer required to craft Disease Cures or Water Filters</li></ul></li><li>Professional Drinker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li></ul></li><li>Ricochet  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Deflect chance based on Luck. Deflect grants a chance to reflect 100% of the damage of ranged attacks back to the attacker and reduces the damage you take from the attack by 50%. Deflect chance receives a bonus while wearing Heavy Armor or Power Armor (+50% multiplier). While in Power Armor, the amount of damage reflected is doubled (200%).</li></ul></li><li>Serendipity  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Evade Chance while under 30% life, based on Luck. Evade provides a chance to avoid all incoming damage from direct attacks. Evade can happen once every second and the cooldown is now increased by armor. Please note, Evade cannot happen when over encumbered or while in Power Armor.  <ul><li>Armor increases Evade cooldown at the following rates:</li><li>Light Armor: +0.1 second per piece</li><li>Medium Armor: +0.2 seconds per piece</li><li>Heavy Armor: +0.4 seconds per piece</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Starched Genes  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 2 to 1</li><li>Moved from Luck to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 now provides the benefits of the former Rank 2</li></ul></li><li>Thru-Hiker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Moved from Agility to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li></ul><h2>ADJUSTMENTS TO EXPLOSION VFX</h2><p>We’ve reduced the radius in which screen flash effects appear for a multitude of explosions throughout the game. This is purely a visual change and does not impact the radius in which damage is dealt.A few of these have had sizeable reductions (especially Fatman and Fatman MIRV explosions). Please be sure to provide feedback on whether these changes are sufficient in reducing unwanted screen flashing, if there’s any additional explosions that we should adjust, or if some explosions no-longer feel impactful and satisfying to use.</p><h2>PLAYER WEAPONS</h2><ul><li>Artillery Piece (Workshop)</li><li>Auto Grenade Launcher / M79</li><li>Baseball Grenade</li><li>Broadsider</li><li>Bug Grenade</li><li>Cryo Arrow</li><li>Cryo Grenade</li><li>Cryo Mine</li><li>Explosions (all types) from weapons using the Explosive legendary mod</li><li>Fatman</li><li>Fatman MIRV (from individual projectiles)</li><li>Flaming Arrow</li><li>Floater Flamer Grenade</li><li>Floater Freezer Grenade</li><li>Frag Grenade</li><li>Grand Finale (Broadsider)</li><li>Hack and Slash (Legendary Perk)</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Cryo Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Napalm Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Plasma Payload</li><li>Missile Launcher</li><li>Missile Turret</li><li>Orbital Strike Beacon</li><li>Plasma Grenade</li><li>Pulse Grenade</li><li>Troglocide</li></ul><h2>NPC WEAPONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h2><p>NPCs’ use of player weapons listed above will also be affected.</p><ul><li>Exploding Cars &amp; other Civilian Vehicles</li><li>Explosive Rounds from Turrets</li><li>Floater Freezer Death</li><li>Fusion Core Meltdown (Robots)</li><li>Gas Canisters</li><li>Invaders from Beyond UFO Missile Strikes</li><li>Mole Rat Landminer</li><li>Robot Death Explosion</li><li>Scorched Exterminator Plasma Launcher</li><li>Super Mutant Suicider Mini-Nuke</li><li>Turret Death Explosion</li><li>Various destructible objects such as machinery in Grafton Steel and The Foundry (The Pitt)</li><li>Vertibird Death Explosion</li><li>Vertibot Death Explosion</li></ul><h2>COMBAT BALANCE</h2><p>The notes you see below are a continuation of the combat rebalancing work that we began during the Skyline Valley patch. This is an ongoing process we will continue to do combat rebalancing work into next year.</p><ul><li>The cooldown of evade effects now scales based on how much damage was avoided</li><li>The durability of armor has been increased</li><li>Slightly increased the chance to learn to craft weapon mods via scrapping</li><li>Slightly increased the amount of Steel and Ballistic fiber that weapon-using enemies can drop</li><li>Balance adjustments for Communist and Liberators</li><li>Added additional information about Damage Types and Damage over Time effects to the Help menu</li><li>Reduced the damage of the Auto Axe: 31 --&gt; 24</li><li>Adjusted the damage of the V63 Zweihaender: 85/45 --&gt; 64/64</li></ul><h2>ARMOR</h2><ul><li>Brotherhood Recon and Secret Service are now classified as Heavy Armor</li><li>Civil Engineer, Arctic Marine, Marine Armor, and Trapper Armors are now classified as Medium Armor</li><li>Covert Scout Armor, Solar Armor, Thorn Armor, Urban Scout Armor, Forest Scout Armor, and Wood Armors are now classified as Light Armor</li><li>Botsmith armor is now classified as Heavy Armor</li></ul><h2>WEAPONS</h2><p>We have made changes to Damage and AP Costs for many weapons which primarily focuses on improving cases where weapons don’t perform well enough to meet players’ expectations.</p><h2>DAMAGE BUFFS</h2><p>These values represent the weapon at its maximum level (45 or 50, depending on the weapon). Lower-level values have similar increases in damage. Damage for the following weapons has been increased:</p><ul><li>10mm Pistol: 28 -&gt; 31</li><li>44 [revolver]: 60 -&gt; 72</li><li>Black Powder Pistol: 176 -&gt; 216</li><li>Black Powder Rifle: 180 -&gt;

14  <ul><li>Dev Note: The Anchorage Ace no-longer gains an additional AP cost benefit beyond the Reflex Sight’s 15% reduction.</li></ul></li><li>.50 Cal Machine Gun: 30 -&gt; 12</li><li>Auto Grenade Launcher: 30 -&gt;

This allows for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes.</p><h2>HUMAN(ISH) CREATURE &amp; WEAPON BALANCE</h2><p>Creatures that previously used player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, and Super Mutants) will now use NPC versions of their weapons with balance adjustments to account for this change (see notes below).When defeated these enemies will have a chance to drop the base version of their weapon alongside some junk items. When a weapon isn’t dropped, the enemy will instead drop more junk items that players can scrap to make up for the loss components you would receive from scrapping these weapons. Increases have also been made to the components earned from scrapping many junk items in the world, so now you will also have more components at your disposal.We have also increased the rate at which you learn mods from scrapping weapons by 10% to account for the lower number of weapons you’ll find from these NPCs. This increase will not affect your chance to learn Legendary weapon mods.</p><ul><li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, Super Mutants):  <ul><li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This brings these enemy types in line with other creatures whose attacks already could scale to level 100.</li></ul></li><li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player grenades is unchanged.</li></ul></li><li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases, at lower level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.</li></ul></li><li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li></ul></li><li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li><li>Now rely more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.  <ul><li>Dev Note: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li></ul></li><li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>CREATURE BALANCE</h2><p>The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates:</p><ul><li>Floater Freezer  <ul><li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core damage).</li></ul></li><li>Floater Flamer  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack.</li></ul></li><li>Floater gnasher  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the bite attack.</li></ul></li><li>Alien Invader  <ul><li>Reduced health</li><li>Reduced damage in Daily Ops.</li></ul></li><li>Lesser Devil  <ul><li>Increased damage.</li></ul></li><li>Bloodbug  <ul><li>Reduced radiation damage at lower levels.</li></ul></li><li>Thrasher  <ul><li>Increased melee attack damage especially at higher levels.</li><li>Decreased Sonic Gobble attack damage at lower levels.</li><li>Now weakest to fire damage and resistant to radiation, energy, and poison damage</li></ul></li><li>Reduced the bonus damage on most creatures’ weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x.</li><li>Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been reduced. In many cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough damage to kill the creature.</li><li>Damage to combat inhibitors for robots and turrets will result in less overall health damage to the robot, but the combat inhibitor can now be destroyed much earlier, before the robot/turret has lost most of its health.</li></ul><h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2><p>When you enter the game for the first time, you’ll be presented with the Accessibility Menu that includes the new settings you see below. This will only appear once and if you need to change any of these settings in the future, go to Settings &gt; Accessibility.Speech-to-Text</p><ul><li>Turning Speech-to-Text ON will add a new message window to the UI that will transcribe all voice communication from other players in the area.</li><li>Message Window Fade Time – Changes how long the message window stays on screen after the last message has been received.</li><li>Message Window Visibility – Changes the transparency of the message window.</li></ul><p>Screen Narration</p><ul><li>When the setting is ON, you’ll hear the audible description of emotes from other players in the area. For example: “[Player] wants to team up!”</li></ul><p>UI Navigation</p><ul><li>Digital Input  <ul><li>Several screens relied completely on analog stick input and that has been addressed to allow keyboard control on PCs and d-pad control on consoles. This includes the Challenges, Scoreboard, Map, and Character Creation screens.</li></ul></li><li>Analog Input  <ul><li>Several screens didn’t support analog inputs to navigate the UI, so that analog functionality has been added to the Favorites Wheel and Social Panel.</li></ul></li><li>Single Key Presses  <ul><li>Fast Travel Countdown Cancel – Now allows a single button command to cancel the fast travel instead of clicking both the left and right analog sticks.</li><li>Social Menu – Allows a single button command to enter the Social Menu instead of having to hold CTRL-TAB on PC.</li></ul></li></ul>

			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty takes the top spot in revenue for the month of October across PC and console, as <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Newzoo</a>. It's not just Black Ops 6 that has boosted the revenue, as Call of Duty Modern Warfare II &amp; III, as well as Call of Duty Warzone, have all contributed to the revenue earnings, helping the franchise take the top spot. In terms of engagement, Call of Duty also did very well for itself, and Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">had the most successful launch</a> in the history of the franchise. This is helped by the fact that Black Ops 6 was a day-one release on Xbox Game Pass for the first time ever, helping many people get the opportunity to play the game without having to pay the hefty price tag for the game.</p>
<p>While Call of Duty did take the top spot for revenue and second place for engagement, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/">Fortnite</a> continues to retain its position as the most-played game across all platforms. It's likely that we will see Fortnite continue to retain this position in November's report, too. This is because the latest chapter of Fortnite has just been released, meaning there is a ton of new content for players to explore. Additionally, they recently just made the change to battle passes that allows players to get all of the battle passes for a single price, rather than paying for them separately.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">Roblox</a> is also on both the engagement and revenue top 20. Roblox takes the third position for engagement on all platforms. Considering that this year saw a rise in influencers and streamers playing the game due to the release of Dress to Impress, it's not surprising that the game shot up in the rankings. With the release of that particular experience, gamers of all ages have been flocking to the platform to give the game a go. On top of that, celebrities have also been making appearances in the game, with K-pop groups and singers such as Charli XCX having their own collaborations or meet-and-greet events.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, two Blizzard Entertainment titles managed to make it onto the top 20 list. World of Warcraft shot up by 138 ranks, securing the third position in PC revenue, which was predominantly driven by the 20th Anniversary Celebration and the release of new content from the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">The War Within expansion</a>. Additionally, Diablo IV saw a significant boost in revenue thanks to the expansion, Vessel of Hatred being released on October 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has become the latest studio to be hit by the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, following in the footsteps of both indie and major studios alike.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269735996861091841/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Torn Banner LinkedIn page, CEO Steve Piggott says his studio has made the "very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce". Piggott doesn't state how many employees have been laid off.</p>

<p>He puts the layoffs down to Torn Banner being a "fully independent, self-funded developer" that is currently "up against many challenges", describing himself and his studio as "saddened to part ways with some of our incredible team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=_bgY0Mbz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=GOA7c0Yc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2</em>'s Torn Banner is the latest studio to report layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the future of Torn Banner's games, Piggott says that&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>won't be affected by these layoffs; the game "is not impacted", and servers will remain up as normal. As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>received its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete" rel="nofollow">final major content update</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>In addition, Piggott says he and Torn Banner are still committed to working on&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, which he says he still believes is "one of the most unique and incredible zombie experiences out there". He goes as far as to call&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>"central to our goals as a studio".</p>

<p>At time of writing, however, it seems that players are divided on whether they agree with him or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a "Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 6,600 reviews, and its 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/292000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stands at just 228</a>, which isn't a great number for what is supposed to be one of a studio's cornerstone games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=dp3ELhqy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=xl3FcFfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>may not quite be the success Torn Banner had hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's entirely possible that with the dedication Piggott seems determined to show to&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, the game can be turned around prior to its 1.0 release, which is currently scheduled for next year.</p>

<p>Torn Banner's layoffs are just the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">sweeping wave</a> that has been consuming both major industry bodies and smaller studios alike, leading to mass layoffs, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>.</p>

        <p>1440p-minded GPUs launch from December, both under $250</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Well slap my backplate and call me CUDA, because not only are Intel’s Arc Battlemage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> not dead – having once been mired in production trouble rumours – but they’ve got names and are out from next week. The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These prices tell us that Battlemage will, as Alchemist did, attempt to bite into the sub-$250 slice of gaming GPU market share pie that Nvidia and AMD seem content to leave uneaten. This time, however, Intel say they’re aiming for speedy 1440p play, which would suggest a huge performance upgrade over 1080p-focused Alchemist models like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-a750-review">Arc A750</a>. "Best-in-class performance-per-dollar", no less, according to the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-launches-arc-b-series-graphics-cards.html">marketing bumf</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, the Arc B580 and Arc B570 will come packing more VRAM – 12GB and 10GB respectively – and support for XeSS 2. This is new version of Intel’s upscaler that includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>-style frame generation feature, generating inserting interpolated frames "using optical flow and motion vector reprojection". Nice? I think? With all the bells and whistles running, XeSS 2 can supposedly multiply framerate output by by 3.9x, though I’d wait to see this in action before slapping down money for a pre-order. Democratising the advantages of frame generation is a noble goal in the face of Nvidia keeping DLSS 3 support for only its latest RTX 40 series GPUs, but FSR 3 has never quite matched it on visual quality or input lag management. Thus, grudgingly, we must accept some truth in the idea that frame gen needs very specific, cutting-edge hardware to work comfortably.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Intel-Arc-B570-reveal.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Intel</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Anyway, I’m more interested in straight-up, traditionally rendered framerates, and specifically whether Intel really can pull off a proper 60fps@1440p card – or two – at such a low price. Or, as we would have said in 2016 or so, a price. The last few years have seen GPU costs rise, yet the GPU themselves sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-pc-performance-best-settings">struggling to keep up</a> with the ever-increasing demands of high fidelity games, to the extent that you can easily end up dropping £500/$500 or more to get a truly capable Quad HD engine. We probably can’t expect the Arc B580 to knock the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review">RTX 4070 Super</a> off its premium perch, but given the dearth of compelling options in the lower budget ranges, I’m certainly willing to watch it take a shot.</p>
<p>In other graphics card news, Nvidia are widely expected to reveal the GeForce RTX 5090 at Las Vegas’ CES show in early January. It will probably cost more than $219. Just a bit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-review-in-progress.1050825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-review-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“First-person shooter” is a broad term. It can mean everything from a monster-filled horror game like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/25/fear-review-2">F.E.A.R.</a>, to a sci-fi adventure like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime</a>, to a demon-eviscerating romp like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">Doom</a>. Even narrowing it down to a label like “military FPS” still puts the linear campaign of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Call of Duty</a>, the enormous PvP clashes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review">Battlefield</a>, and the white knuckle extractions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> under a single umbrella. Delta Force, the latest entry in a now 26-year-old shooter series, is probably best defined as a bit of each of those last three – with a dedicated large-scale PvP mode, a separate extraction shooter mode, and an (as yet unreleased) campaign, it sits somewhat awkwardly at the center of a that Venn diagram. It is still too early to render a final verdict, but my initial hours playing ahead of launch have already left me intrigued enough that I’m looking forward to my next deployment on the live servers later this week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because this release is technically the start of an indefinite “open beta” (which, for a free-to-play game, really just means it’s out), only two of the three main modes are currently available, with the campaign planned as paid DLC somewhere down the line. Of the two that are here now, the Warfare mode is Delta Force’s answer to the big team combat of Battlefield. 64 players duke it out for supremacy across one of a handful of massive, sprawling arenas. The matches I played in the early review period were focused on the Attack and Defend option within Warfare, though King of the Hill and some other time-based modes are apparently going to be available at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack and Defend puts one team on offense, tasked with capturing some strategic points before running out of a finite number of respawns, while the other team defends those areas with limitless lives. If the offense succeeds, they refill their respawns and the cycle begins anew on another part of the map until all of the field is seized or the defense stops them in their tracks. It’s a good setup; initially, the offense has the advantage thanks to favorable terrain and an abundance of vehicles, but things even out as the match progresses and the defense retreats toward their home base. This means each side typically gets to spend some time as both the figurative hammer and the nail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battles certainly do feel big, which is a good thing. Fast respawns mean both teams are dense with soldiers. Once the bullets and rockets start flying, the chaos and confusion on the battlefield is exciting. It’s particularly fun when you get behind the controls of a vehicle and start running roughshod over the other team. A tank fully loaded with gunners can dominate, but don’t sleep on the impact of a simple machine gun turret on the top of an armored car. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Abilities are helpful in battle, but won't outright win a skirmish.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the times I’ve found myself on the wrong end of that tank barrel I haven’t been totally helpless thanks to the varied operatives you can choose from mid-match. These named characters act as a sort of hybrid between a simple loadout choice and a bespoke hero, which fits the jack-of-all-trades theme persistent throughout Delta Force. If you are being overrun by vehicles, it might be a good idea to spawn with a rocket launcher, or if the fight is taking place in open spaces, it could be time to bust out the trusty sniper rifle. Each character has unique abilities that are helpful in battle too, like Luna’s Detection Arrows that can periodically be fired to reveal enemies, but none are so powerful as to outright win a skirmish, let alone a whole match, for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I just wish the actual action felt better. Bullet arc and trajectory factor heavily into shooting, so leading your targets is essential for firing accurately at a distance. That, combined with a fast time-to-kill, makes for gunplay more in the spirit of a military sim like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arma-reforger-review">Arma</a>. That’s all well and good on its own, but feels deeply at odds with the aggressive pace of play that the objective-based Attack and Defend mode drives. Slow bullets at the mercy of gravity that kill you instantly feel a little too airsoft-like for an intense battle over a key chokepoint. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Get in, get loot, get out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other side of things, the Operations mode follows the familiar extraction shooter framework; you and up to two friends can form a three-person squad to enter an area, shoot, loot, and scoot. Whatever you bring back to your base between rounds you can either sell, store, or use in the next attempt, and whatever is on you if you die or don’t escape in time is lost for good. It’s a tried-and-true formula that Delta Force follows to the letter, but the high quality of its execution makes up for that unoriginality. q</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is an open sandbox that is dense with potential objectives. Maps easily highlight points of interest for things like bounty targets, safes to plunder, and intel to decode. That might seem like a small detail to praise, but in a genre dominated by games like Escape from Tarkov that are designed to be intentionally opaque, making important information accessible is a nice differentiator. I like being able to just drop a waypoint and know what I’m in for when I get there without having to memorize the maps. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So far I’m a fan of the enemy variety in the Operations mode.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you pick your destination, you’ll need to shoot your way through squads of AI soldiers, and occasionally human-controlled enemies. You never know who’s around, or in what numbers, so every enemy encounter starts with some fast risk assessment: do you take the shot and risk letting everyone know where you are, or do you sneak by for the stealthy approach, leaving a potential threat on the field? Making quick decisions with limited information does a good job of keeping the action strategic and interesting. That’s particularly true if you see other people, as they are certainly more dangerous than the bots, but could be loot-rich targets worth taking on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far I’m a fan of the enemy variety. My squad has taken down roving bands of riflemen, ducked into buildings to avoid sniper fire, and executed on-the-fly flanking maneuvers to get around riot shields. One memorable moment saw my team pinned down by a massive armored baddie blasting at us with a minigun as we lobbed grenades from behind cover. Another time, a member of our trio was cracking a safe while the other squadmate and I provided cover, and I almost jumped out of my chair when a giant alligator came around the corner and tried to put a stop to our fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My primary worry about Operations at this point is the loop loot. There are all sorts of containers everywhere, like file cabinets, coat pockets, fallen enemies, etc. – but after just a few hours with the mode, I rarely bother to check them anymore now that I have a good idea of where to go for the actual high-ticket items. I’m hopeful there won’t be a point where the maps feel “solved” anytime soon, but they are already feeling less dynamic with each run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The time between them is spent at the Black Site, which functions as your home base. This is where you buy, sell, and make upgrades, particularly to the amount of storage space in your stash. It’s also where you manage the well-built loadouts option. This lets you save a few different kits you can take into battle and rebuild them with just a few clicks. Pieces will be pulled from your inventory first, and then automatically purchased from the store as needed. It’s a fast and slick way to get back in the action, which helps take the sting out of a failed extraction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, these are all still just my initial impressions - it takes time to get a comprehensive feel for how well a PvP mode like Warfare is working, and there are still a few Operations I haven’t explored, so I’m not quite ready to give a final verdict until I’ve played on the live servers. However, I can say that the extraction mode is a lot of fun in the early going, and I enjoy the scale of Delta Force’s PvP encounters even if I’m not yet sold that this style of gunplay is the right match for that action. It’s at least clear this is a competent free-to-play shooter that can cater to a few different FPS tastes, but it remains to be seen if it has the staying power to keep my interest once the initial novelty wears off. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>According to one of the top bosses at PlayStation, the rise in artificial intelligence technologies in game development has the potential to "revolutionize" gaming, but only as a tool that assists humans.</p><p>"Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial," Hermen Hulst told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.</p><p>He went on to predict that the gaming industry will see a "dual demand," split between AI-driven "innovative experiences" and a second for "handcrafted, thoughtful content."</p><p>There are concerns among industry developers about the potential for advancements to AI ending up taking jobs from humans. This is part of the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">why video game voice actors are now on strike</a> and why some labor unions are calling on workers to organize.</p><p>Another video game executive, Christoph Hartmann of Amazon, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-solve-game-industrys-problems-or-at-least-some-of-them-amazon-boss-says/1100-6526061/" data-ref-id="1100-6526061">he believes AI could replace "boring" parts of video game jobs</a>, including localization as he sees it. However, Hartmann and others believe the rise in AI technologies will create enough new jobs to offset any potential job losses. EA's Andrew Wilson previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-boss-explains-why-ai-will-be-good-for-gaming/1100-6518421/" data-ref-id="1100-6518421">the agricultural and industrial revolutions took many jobs but created countless more</a>, and he sees an AI revolution following a similar playbook.</p><p>The video game industry had another tough year in 2024 with thousands of worker layoffs, along with game cancellations and studio closures. A number of companies whose executives are speaking positively about AI--including Microsoft, EA, Amazon, and PlayStation--have all cut jobs in the past year. Whether or not these cuts were at all related to AI is unknown, however.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 Zombies - Citadelle des Morts Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The new gameplay trailer shows off some of the interior and exterior parts of the castle setting, with the cast of characters fighting off hordes with elemental swords, the new Tesla Storm field upgrade, and making use of the map's special traps. One trap looks like it's dumping hot oil or acid on the undead.</p><p dir="ltr">The gameplay also shows the terrifying new Doppelghast enemy. Just like Liberty Falls and Terminus have their own unique elite Zombie type, Citadelle des Morts features the Doppelghast, which has multiple heads and tentacle-like appendages instead of arms. This enemy looks like it can run pretty fast, and it looks very creepy doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include the Vulture Aid Perk-a-Cola, the Tesla Storm field upgrade, the Light Mend ammo mod, and 18 more Augments to unlock.</p><p>For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>.

			<p>In <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/the-case-for-in-game-video-platforms-closing-the-direct-to-consumer-gap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIDiA Research's upcoming report</a>, they've concluded that gamers spend more time watching videos on platforms like <a href="https://wccftech.com/detroit-become-human-has-sold-over-5-million-units-community-play-twitch-extension-reportedly-very-popular/">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtube-videos-skipping-till-end-if-you-have-adblocker-enabled/">YouTube</a> rather than playing games. In the report, it says that there is an 'untapped potential' for game publishers to have video content from inside their ecosystems to third-party platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. The report says that gamers are now spending more time watching videos, averaging 8.5 hours per week on video versus 7.4 hours gaming. Although there are plenty of games to be played, it isn't too surprising that a lot of people watch games instead. Whether this be from watching streamers play their favorite games or watching streamers take on horror games so they don't have to, video content is overall just a tiny bit more popular.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>24% of console and PC players watch game-related videos at least monthly, with 48% of in-game buyers watching game-related content at least monthly. The report shows that a common factor is that those who view content tend to be high-spending gamers, especially when it comes to microtransactions. As a result, the report suggests that there is an open market for in-game video platforms to offer publishers a direct line to the highest-value fans.</p>
<p>For a lot of popular games, it may be a little bit difficult to pull something like that off, but eSports would be a great way to attempt to bring video content inside games, especially considering how often events happen within eSports and Fighting games, for example. By doing this, it would allow publishers to unlock new revenue streams in the process, something that publishers are struggling with when third-party video platforms exist.</p>
<p>This is something that has the potential to be revolutionary, especially at a time when the game market is facing growth stagnation and competition across all genres is at an all-time high. Especially for those living in areas with significant economic crises, it means that people have to choose what game to purchase rather than purchasing multiple.</p>
<p>"It's time for game publishers to think about in-game video as something beyond marketing alone. By reclaiming video engagement, publishers have the potential to unlock new revenue streams like advertising, and drive growth," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MIDiA Research, the author of this particular report.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console sales have already hit a very impressive milestone, even though the game has only been out on consoles for just over a month.</p>

<p>In a press release, Kinetic marks 35 days since&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console launch, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween" rel="nofollow">times</a> before finally happening just before Halloween this year. Since that point,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>has sold a million copies on consoles.</p>

<p>According to Kinetic, that figure brings&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s total sales up to almost 22 million, which is a very impressive milestone indeed. That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>ahead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">co-op platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">It Takes Two</a>&nbsp;</em>and remaster collection&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</em></a>&nbsp;at last count.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=NTlbRGC1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-sales-camera.jpg?itok=QHjnA1_K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s console release has sold very well indeed for Kinetic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Kinetic CEO and&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>lead developer Daniel Knight describes the sales milestone as "the best Christmas present we could have wished for", thanking the game's "wonderful, supportive, and engaged community".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>was originally released on PC via Steam Early Access back in September 2020. It's received a number of updates since then, with major patches bringing things like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">progression overhaul</a>, new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-0810-adds-insanity-difficulty-and-more" rel="nofollow">difficulty levels</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-adds-3-new-ghosts-truck-improvements" rel="nofollow">more ghosts to contend with</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the game remains in Early Access; Kinetic still says it's planning a full release in late 2024, but since we're in the early days of December, this is looking more and more unlikely.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which you must team up with your friends to find and document supernatural phenomena in a range of haunted locations.</p>

<p>You'll have access to a range of ghost-hunting equipment to help you do so, and each ghost behaves in a different way, so you'll need to have your wits about you in order to discover which ghost you've encountered and how to best deal with it.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/1994-ps-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">turns 30 today</a> (December 3), and it had a lot of us at Insider Gaming thinking about the time we’ve spent with Sony’s first console. From experience Metal Gear Solid for the first time to the chaos that was Twisted Metal, there were no shortage of fun games to pass the time in the 90s. </p>



<p>So we decided to have a little fun and put together our lists of our favorite original PlayStation games. Now, we’re not saying these are the best games ever made. These are just the ones we had the most fun with in our time playing the console. </p>



<p>It’s always fun to look back at what we loved. And who knows, maybe there’s a game you forgot about that you want to revisit or play for the first time. Check out our favorites, and let us know what yours are in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/favorite-playstation-games-ever.1285/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

There are some major unknowns here and some asterisks to be aware of, however.</p><p>Chinese retailer Alibaba is now selling screen protectors for the Switch 2, and these screen protectors are larger than what would be required for the current Switch, which is 7 inches for the OLED edition. A previous leak suggested the Switch 2's screen could be 8 inches.

		<p>A brand new city builder called Amberspire has been announced by Bithell Games and Lunar Division, with this providing a twist on the genre by being dice based. Set on an abandoned moon orbiting a gas giant, the fate of how the city grows and flourishes will depend on the dice rolls. The dice determine which resources you get, meaning you will have to adapt the city to what they provide. This will not be the only challenge as the moon’s environment will provide its own challenges, and different factions will spring up, which can upset the harmony you will be trying to create.</p>
<p><iframe title="Amberspire | Announce Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpkTQUT94-Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Amberspire’s key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dice-driven systems</strong>&nbsp;govern resources, buildings, weather, and events. Dice guide you to play reactively and create interesting scenarios.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Systemic ecology and citizen dynamics</strong>&nbsp;create a lively and unique world. The residents of your city grow according to their environment. Likewise, the weather and ecology of the moon respond to the increasing number of buildings and can threaten your progress.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Factions and political drama</strong>&nbsp;can dramatically affect your capabilities. Dynamic events infuse the story of your city as factions compete with each other.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hand-drawn isometric art</strong>&nbsp;beautifully realize the buildings that comprise your city, and lush portraits depict the many factions in the galaxy.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>An original soundtrack</strong>&nbsp;composed by nervous_testpilot that brings to life the unique world of Amber and its moon.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A release date for Amberspire is yet to be confirmed, and it appears that it is PC only.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350750/Amberspire/"> Amberspire can be wishlisted on Steam now.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1050750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/main/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearl Abyss</a>, the developer and publisher of Black Desert has announced that they are officially developing native builds of the game for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X|S. These native builds will offer enhanced visuals, smoother gameplay, and much-needed performance upgrades to make sure that the game runs smoothly and is tailored to next-gen consoles. This update will be free for all current Black Desert Console players.</p>
<p>If you prefer to get your news in the form of a video, General Manager Matt goes into detail about what you can expect from the console updates.</p>
<p><iframe title="Message from Black Desert Console Team" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oW6Ra1fNzwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it stands, the PS5 version's development has been completed and is nearing platform certification, while the Xbox Series X development is currently ongoing. Pearl Abyss plans&nbsp; for both of the builds to launch in the first half of 2025, when there will then be additional updates to Black Desert Console, like the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>In addition to the native build development for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, it's been confirmed by Pearl Abyss that there will be a ton of updates coming to Black Desert on December 12 to help keep players engaged in the interim between the native build release and the release of the Land of the Morning Light expansion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light expansion</a> was released earlier this year on PC and took players to a new region of ancient Korea, with lots of stunning visuals, traditional Korean architecture, and beautiful scenery. The expansion is free for all players. The most common complaint about the expansion is that the amount of information thrown at you is overwhelming, especially if you are a new player in the game.&nbsp; Additionally, combat, which is a vital part of Black Desert, wasn't really explained as much in Land of the Morning Light, and those who had never played the game before would find it a bit of a struggle to figure out the systems.</p>
<p>On December 12, Kharazad Accessories will be added to the game, as well as an Accessory Exchange System that allows players to exchange parts of the Deboreka accessory set to get other parts of the set that they may need.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be daily rewards and buffs to help players through the grind. Beneficial items like Mythical Censer and significant buffs that are added to the game will be running until March 2025. This includes a 50% buff to Training EXP, a 100% buff to Farming EXP, and Combat EXP being buffed to 500%.</p>

The two Windows-based handhelds come with 32GB of RAM and larger batteries than their predecessors. They release on December 25th, but you can preorder them now, starting at $799 for the Claw 7 and $899 for the Claw 8.</p><p>When the original MSI Claw shipped last spring, MSI needed to address battery life and performance, both of which were both sticking points in Sean Hollister’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review"><em>Verge</em> review</a>. The Claw 8 brings more significant changes here; its 80-watt-hour battery is a big jump over the original model’s 53 watt hours. The Claw 7 has a much smaller increase at 54.5 watt hours. The Claw 8 also has an “easy access” SSD storage slot that the Claw 7 lacks. </p><p>Both devices have a 120Hz variable refresh rate LCD display, but the Claw 8’s 8-inch screen is slightly higher resolution (1920 x 1200) than the Claw 7’s 7-inch one (1920 x 1080). Performance-wise, MSI claims the handhelds will have a 113 percent higher peak FPS and 20 percent higher average FPS than its competitors “under identical power conditions.” MSI doesn’t say which competitors it’s referring to, but in Sean’s review, the previous model was outdone by the Steam Deck OLED, Asus ROG Ally Z1E, and the Lenovo Legion Go.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new MSI Claw 8 AI Plus and Claw 7 AI Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: MSI</cite></p></div><p>Other changes to both handhelds include redesigned Hall effect sticks and triggers, and updated bumpers and D-pad. MSI also added a second Thunderbolt 4 port to each one’s complement of I / O ports that includes an audio jack and a microSD card reader. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ll get to <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, but also leaving Game Pass is <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>, the middle-installment of the <em>Survivor</em> trilogy, Supermassive’s interactive horror <em>The Quarry</em>, adorable all-ages puzzle-platformer <em>Rainbow Billy</em>, puzzle adventure <em>Tin Hearts</em>, the lovely (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/forager_team_retaliates_after_lead_dev_blames_them_for_cancelled_multiplayer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/forager_team_retaliates_after_lead_dev_blames_them_for_cancelled_multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">although the development wasn’t</a></span>) crafting game <em>Forager</em>, and hit first-person horror <em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em>.</p><p>Oof, that’s a lot of strong titles to be going at once. And I’m personally annoyed about <em>The Bunker</em>, as I’d just spent far too long rearranging my storage space on my Series S to be able to install it, as it’s the only <em>Amnesia</em> game I’ve not gotten around to playing.</p><p>The story with <em>Forza</em> is a whole lot worse, although it’s nothing to do with Game Pass. On December 15, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-4-delisted-xbox-licensing-1851561111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-4-delisted-xbox-licensing-1851561111">as we first learned about in June</a></span>, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> is being delisted from all online gaming stores entirely—and it’s all because of licensing.</p><p>2018's <em>Horizon 4</em> immediately became one of the most beloved games...pretty much ever. Set in the English Cotswolds (although, as someone who technically lives in the Cotswolds, I’d venture a somewhat idyllic interpretation), it sits on an astonishing Metascore of 92, with a dedicated fanbase still playing as the final season, series 77, draws to a close.</p><p>The Microsoft-owned game has never expanded on what these “licensing issues” are, but you would imagine that during its development, the rights to use the vast numbers of real-world cards would have been agreed to on a limited contract. And given the timing, it’d be reasonable to guess it had been set for six years. I mean, six years, right?! That’s <em>forever</em>! They’d have known they were aiming for a 2021 release for <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, meaning they’d have an extra three years covered even after it had been usurped...</p><p>The good news is if you <em>own</em> the game (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">you don’t actually <em>own</em> the game</a></span>), you will be able to continue playing it, both offline and online (although the latter is likely to go eventually). All the game’s DLC was already lost in the summer, but if you bought any to use with your Game Pass subscription version of the main game, you’ll have received tokens that’ll unlock the same in a paid version. They expire in June 2026, but you know, use them now or you’ll certainly forget. You know what you’re like.</p><p>So yes, this is the last chance to <em>ever</em> buy <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, and it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/forza-horizon-4-standard-edition/9PNJXVCVWD4K&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/forza-horizon-4-standard-edition/9PNJXVCVWD4K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriately discounted on the Xbox store right now</a></span> to $12.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
