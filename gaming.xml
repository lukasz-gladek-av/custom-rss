			<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is an excellent showcase of what the PlayStation 5 Pro and the AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler are capable of doing, according to a new early analysis.</p>
<p>The new analysis from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-pssr-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a>, based on pre-release footage, confirms the remaster of the second entry in the series by Naughty Dog targets 4K resolution, 60 FPS on the upcoming console, using PSSR to upscale to 4K resolution from 1440p. This delivers a considerable visual leap over the base model's Performance mode, as the upscaler improves texture detail and reduces blurriness and aliasing, especially in fine textures like foliage. On PlayStation 5 Pro, the game also shows noticeable improvements in geometric edges. Additionally, performance is extremely solid, as the game runs at a constant 60 FPS, with the exception of a few scenarios.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered's usage of PSSR also allowed Digital Foundry to highlight how the upscaler delivers better image stability than the more widely used AMD FSR. As the game has yet to be released on PC, a direct comparison is not possible, but using its predecessor, it's still clear how the upscaler lags behind NVIDIA DLSS in some regards, such as with fine edge details.</p>

<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered was hardly in need of improvements, unlike other games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, but still, it is great to hear that even games that look and run fine on the base model can take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's features to offer even better experiences. As such, the remaster will become even more the ultimate way to enjoy Naughty Dog's games, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-bosses-and-tencent-reportedly-consider-taking-company-private.1000815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which suggests Ubisoft's founders, the Guillemots, and investor Tencent are potentially considering a private buyout of the company to fend off investor challenges.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (note: report behind paywall), which cites the usual "people familiar with the matter", Tencent and the Guillemots have been discussing "ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value" with financial advisors (that's Bloomberg's wording).</p>
<p>One of the possibilities being discussed by the Guillemots and Tencent is a teamup to enact a private buyout of the company, which would take it off the market, theoretically putting an end to the demands of public shareholders and companies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-buyout-report.jpg?itok=5ODErayv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-buyout-report.jpg?itok=CNbFkhaZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The poor performance of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is one factor that's led Ubisoft shareholders to express dissatisfaction.</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, Ubisoft has come under fire from some shareholders, particularly activist investment company AJ Investments, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">publicly criticized</a> Ubisoft recently over its "current performance and strategic direction".</p>
<p>AJ Investments' suggestions for improvement included a private buyout, changing management and ousting the Guillemots, and others, but whatever the outcome, the shareholder clearly wants fundamental structural change.</p>
<p>In late September, AJ Investments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">claimed it had the support</a> of around 10% of Ubisoft's shareholders in its demands, and that, combined with French union STJV threatening strike action over return-to-work policies and purportedly low salaries, has likely been a thorn in the Guillemots' sides.</p>
<p>All of this also comes alongside a delay to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>; the game was originally intended to come out in November, but it'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">now launch in February</a>, although said delay doesn't appear to have anything to do with the ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy">controversy surrounding the game's co-protagonist Yasuke</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ubisoft-stealth.jpg?itok=Vzh7OzYi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ubisoft-stealth.jpg?itok=MFMJHK_p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been pushed back to February, and Ubisoft investors probably aren't happy.</figcaption></figure><p>As Bloomberg points out, Ubisoft stocks <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubisoft-shares-sink-decade-low-083010524.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sunk to their lowest in over ten years</a> after the delay was announced, although it's worth noting that alongside the delay, Ubisoft also revealed sales of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>hadn't been particularly strong.</p>
<p>If there is a buyout, it's likely the majority of the cash will come from Ubisoft investor Tencent, especially since the company also has an almost 50% stake in the Guillemots' holding company.</p>
<p>Of course, no official announcement has been made yet, and Bloomberg points out that its sources say Tencent and the Guillemots "are also considering other options". We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <p>I’m usually a little suspicious of anything that winkingly describes itself as “very normal”. It’s got Mental Baz energy to me. You’ve met mental Baz, right? He’s mental, he is! Has half a lemonade shandy with lunch sometimes, and wears one of those t-shirts that look like a tuxedo. Absolute mentalist! Anyway, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">reviewing</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a> last week it’s thankfully far more interesting and creative than poor old Baz, who’s honestly just a bit shy and actually really nice when you get past the facade. Grunn just released today, and my high level tempter is that it’s a little bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, just with all the touching wonder replaced by spooky whimsy. Here’s a trailer:</p>

<p>“A gardener gets hired for maintenance work over the weekend. A simple task, but strangely some tools are missing,” reads Grunn’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720950/Grunn/">Steam page</a>. “The owner of the garden isn't around, and their house is off-limits. Perhaps new tools can be found in the mysterious town, or maybe some of the reserved townsfolk have seen them?”</p>
<p>Grunn is from Tom van den Boogaart Sokpop collective, who’ve done all sorts of wonderful bits, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stacklands-is-a-gentle-village-building-game-played-with-cards">Stacklands</a>, which is just one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sokpop-collective-are-releasing-their-100th-game-and-aiming-for-100-more">100 games they’d made as of 2022</a>. It’s really one of those less-you-know-the-better cases, but here’s a non-spoilery summary from my review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is Grunn for you? Well, do you like the feeling of doing things that took you a long time before, again, but really fast? Do you like weird and delightful discoveries? Do you like going ‘ah!’ really loudly when a mystery clicks together? Do you like dying in various ways and unlocking new endings and knowing to do things a little differently next time around?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever used one of those quote box things for my own words before. It feels opulent. Dangerous, even. Anyway, Grunn is great. Do check it out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-rise-30-amid-buyout-reports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/">11-year lows</a> last week, Ubisoft stock prices have soared amid rumors of a potential buyout involving Tencent.</p>



<p>Almost immediately after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-considering-buyout-with-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the report on the talks</a> broke, Ubisoft shares rose from €10.77 to €14.07 within an hour. As of writing, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBI.PA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shares sit</a> at €13.70, a 28.9% increase for the day. </p>



<p>In the United States, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBSFY/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">jump was about</a> the same percentage wise. It rose from $2.32 to $3.09 within 45 minutes. It has since fallen back to $2.98, a 28.8% increase, as of writing.</p>



<p>Overall, shares are still down 11% and 14% in France and the United States this month, respectively. They also remain down 42% year to date. So, while the increase is good for shareholders, it’s still a far cry — pun intended — from where it was earlier this year.</p>



<p>Inside the company, Ubisoft is continuing to look for answers after a number of recent struggles. Star Wars Outlaws struggled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell 1 million</a> copies in its first month while its free-to-play first-person shooter XDefiant is having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems keeping players</a>.</p>



<p>While a potential buyout and going private is a possibility, it’s worth noting that nothing has been finalized.</p>

<p>In the wake of those legal efforts against other Switch emulator developers, the Ryujinx developers posted an automated message on their Discord server in response to any questions about Ryujinx's ultimate fate. "Nothing is happening to Ryujinx," the message read. "We know nothing more than you do. No dooming."</p>

      A video of an in-development Ryujinx feature allowing local wired multiplayer between an emulator and official hardware.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Riperiperi reports that development will now stop on "a working Android port" of the emulator, which was not yet ready for release, as well as a tech demo iOS version that would likely have remained a "novelty" due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/apples-restrictions-hold-back-the-first-pc-emulator-on-the-ios-app-store/">Apple's just-in-time compilation restrictions</a>. Developers were also working on updates that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo">would have allowed local wired multiplayer gameplay connections between Ryujinx and real Switch hardware</a>.</p>
<p>"While I won't be remaining in the switch scene either, I still believe in emulation as a whole, and hope that other developers aren't dissuaded by this," riperiperi writes on the project's Discord. "The future of game preservation does depend on individuals, and maybe one day it'll be properly recognized."</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240929032104/https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx?tab=readme-ov-file">According to the developers</a>, "as of May 2024, Ryujinx [had] been tested on approximately 4,300 titles; over 4,100 boot[ed] past menus and into gameplay, with roughly 3,550 of those being considered playable."</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-coordinated-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-%E2%80%9Ccoordinated%E2%80%9D-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict.1000788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/epic-lawsuit-says-samsung-coordinated-with-google-to-get-around-trial-verdict/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The new suit makes heavy reference to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/at-trial-epic-argues-google-bribed-its-way-to-an-android-app-monopoly/">arguments from the <em>Epic v. Google</em> case</a> alleging that an informal agreement between Samsung and Google has prevented the Samsung Galaxy Store from becoming a true competitor to the Google Play store. The suit notes that, while the Samsung Store is available on 40 percent of all Android phones, it represents only about 1 percent of all Android app downloads.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also calls attention to the timing of Samsung's decision to turn on Auto Blocker by default just as Epic and other third-party App Stores were launching on Android. That timing is especially suspicious, according to the lawsuit, in light of Samsung's initial Auto Blocker announcement last year, which left the feature off by default because, as Samsung put it, "[t]here are many benefits to intentional sideloading, such as enhanced customization and control over a device’s functionality."</p>
<p>This fact pattern forms the core of Samsung's argument that implementing Auto Blocker by default must have been "a coordinated decision by Google and Samsung to circumvent" the results of the <em>Epic v. Google</em> lawsuit. While the suit doesn't provide any concrete evidence that such an agreement exists, it argues that "absent an agreement between Samsung and Google, it would be irrational for Samsung (or any company in its position) to entrench the Play Store monopoly."</p>
<p>In a statement, Samsung said it planned to "vigorously contest Epic Games' baseless claims... The features integrated into its devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users' personal data."</p>

      Phil Spencer's Tokyo Game Show update.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Beloved real-time strategy classics <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em> will soon be available in Microsoft's Game Pass subscription for PC, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/starcraft-game-pass/">announced</a> during the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>It's already free to play both <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em>'s multiplayer modes on PC. This move to Game Pass will make the equally excellent single-player campaigns available to anyone with a subscription, though. Game Pass will also offer all the expansions for both games.</p>
<p>The subscription will provide access to <em>StarCraft Remastered</em>, a revamped version of the original 1998 game that came out in 2017, as well as the <em>StarCraft II Campaign Collection</em>, which includes all 70-plus single-player missions from <em>StarCraft II</em>'s <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, <em>Legacy of the Void</em>, and <em>Nova Covert Ops</em>.</p>
<p>The announcement was the lone bit of new information in a brief video by Xbox boss Phil Spencer. He appeared in the video wearing a <em>StarCraft</em> T-shirt, which might have gotten <em>StarCraft</em> fans' hopes up that the franchise would be getting a new game for the first time in over a decade.</p>
<p>That didn't happen, of course, but the games' addition to Game Pass will likely expose them to many new players who may have been too young to play the influential strategy titles when they debuted in 1998 and 2010.</p>
<p>These aren't the first Blizzard games to be added to Game Pass since Microsoft acquired Activision-Blizzard. First came <em>Diablo IV</em>, then <em>Overwatch 2</em>—the latter was free-to-play already by the time it came to Game Pass, but Microsoft included it in the Game Pass distribution platform and offered cosmetics and goodies to Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>The <em>StarCraft</em> games will launch for PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on November 5.</p>

          <p>In the last few years, large swaths of the game industry have embraced generative AI, both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/game-developer-survey-50-work-at-a-studio-already-using-generative-ai-tools/">on the development side</a> and for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/are-robloxs-new-ai-coding-and-art-tools-the-future-of-game-development/">new user-generated content tools</a>. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/12/nintendos-miyamoto-stepping-down-working-on-smaller-games/">legendary Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto</a> says his company "would rather go in a different direction" when it comes to AI technology.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">a recent interview with The New York Times</a>, Miyamoto said this wasn't just contrarianism on Nintendo's part. “It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special,” Miyamoto said. “There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”</p>
<p>Miyamoto's statement comes a few months after a more noncommittal position Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">in a July investor Q&amp;A</a>. "Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," Furukawa said at the time.</p>

<p>Thus far, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-continues-to-shovel-money-into-the-growing-vr-gaming-segment/">heavily money-losing Reality Labs division</a> has been primarily focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">bulky virtual reality headsets</a> (and some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/even-people-who-bought-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-dont-want-to-use-them/">odd, display-free Ray-Ban branded sunglasses</a>). So when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled out a 100 g pair of see-through, augmented-reality glasses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091">at this year's Meta Connect keynote</a>, it represented a bit of a new direction for the company.</p>
<p>The prototype Orion AR glasses Zuckerberg showed off today don't mean Meta will be ready to release a pair of consumer AR glasses anytime soon. But the demo represents a new vision for lightweight, wide-ranging, see-through smartglasses that Zuckerberg calls "a glimpse of the future" and "the dream of Reality Labs."</p>
<h2>Not your average screen</h2>
<p>The core challenge of building a pair of comfortable augmented-reality glasses, Zuckerberg said, is that "they have to be glasses." That means no bulky headset (a la Quest), no wires (a la Apple Vision Pro), and a weight of less than 100 grams (compared to a full 515 g for the Meta Quest 3). While there's a tiny battery and "custom silicon" in those lightweight glasses, Zuckerberg admitted that some processing is done in a "small puck" that connects wirelessly to the glasses themselves.</p>

    <p><span>Orion is a little thicker than actual glasses, but a whole lot smaller than VR headsets.</span>
                    <span>
                      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091" target="_blank">Meta</a>
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>To achieve true augmented reality, Zuckerberg said Orion uses a screen that "is not actually a screen." Instead, the glasses use tiny projectors embedded in the arms, which shoot light into specially designed waveguides. From there, the light hits "nanoscale 3D structures etched into the lenses" to show holographic images that can be layered at various depths and sizes on top of a natural view of the real world as seen through transparent lenses.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Zuckerberg said it has been a challenge making sure those images are sharp enough to capture fine details and bright enough to be seen in all sorts of lighting conditions. "This isn't passthrough," Zuckerberg stressed during the keynote. "This is the physical world with holograms displayed on it."</p>
<p>Orion's microprojection technology allows for a field of view that Meta says is "the largest... in the smallest AR glasses form to date." <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-wore-metas-orion-ar-glasses-a-wireless-taste-of-a-neural-future/">In live demos</a> to press, Meta said that the field of view reaches 70 degrees, compared to just <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/hololens-2-field-of-view/">52 degrees for Microsoft's older Hololens 2</a> or <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/report-magic-leap-ones-field-view-detailed-developer-documentation/">50 degrees for the Magic Leap One</a>, to cite some more limited examples of consumer AR.</p>
<p>To control these holograms, Orion users can use voice commands or hand- and eye-tracking like that already seen on Quest VR headsets. But Zuckerberg also talked up a "neural interface" wristband—which the company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-hardware-plans-include-thinner-quest-this-year-ad-supported-ar-in-2027/">teased previously</a>—that can read tiny wrist and finger movements even without line of sight to the glasses themselves. That will let you interact with what's on your glasses without having to awkwardly speak out loud or hold your hands in front of you like a zombie, Zuckerberg said.</p>

    <p><span>"Holographic Ping-Pong" is one of the early prototype uses for the Orion glasses prototype.</span>
                    <span>
                      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091" target="_blank">Meta</a>
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>So far, Meta seems to have a pretty limited vision of what can be done with this new kind of display. Zuckerberg mentioned answering a text without having to pull out your phone, playing "holographic Ping-Pong" with others in the room, or talking to "life-sized holograms of people" who&nbsp;appear in the same space with you (which looked pretty lumpy and odd in the on-stage demo). A <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/">Meta blog post about Orion</a> suggested "multitasking windows" of floating translucent screens, hands-free video calls "while you wash the dishes," or glancing at a pantry full of food and letting AI craft you a recipe.</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>As with smartphones, it will probably take a while for developers to really figure out what to do with this new mode of computer interaction. But unlike bulky VR headsets or "passthrough" mixed-reality experiences, truly lightweight AR glasses like these seem like they could be much easier to integrate into everyday tasks without awkwardness or discomfort.</p>
<h2>Still years away</h2>
<p>Meta's interest in augmented reality isn't exactly new—the company announced plans for a device like this publicly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-announces-plans-to-build-augmented-reality-glasses/">in 2019</a>. Now that we're at the public prototype phase, though, the finish line of an actual consumer AR product seems more within sight for Meta.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/">a blog post discussing Orion</a>, Meta says it is "one of the most polished product prototypes we’ve ever developed, and is truly representative of something that could ship to consumers." But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview">The Verge notes</a> that constructing that prototype currently runs Meta a whopping $10,000 per unit, which is far from a consumer-friendly price point.</p>
<p>At Connect, Zuckerberg said the team is working to scale things up on the manufacturing side to make things more affordable, as well as aiming for a sharper display and sleeker, more fashionable design. That effort could culminate in products based on this prototype "in the next few years," according to Meta's blog post. That would align with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-hardware-plans-include-thinner-quest-this-year-ad-supported-ar-in-2027/">a leaked 2023 Meta hardware roadmap</a> that projected its first AR glasses to launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Zuckerberg said Orion would be used as an internal prototype for Meta to build its AR operating system and loaned to "a handful of external partners" to start working on software. "This is where we are going," Zuckerberg said. "These glasses exist, they are awesome, and they are... a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting."</p>

Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>
<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p>
<p>Most fans of the first game expected a new location in <em>Tsushima</em>'s sequel, but they may not have expected the other big change: there appears to be a new protagonist. The woman who appears in the trailers is not Jin Sakai, the main character of <em>Tsushima</em>. This suggests the franchise will move forward with something like an anthology format instead of direct sequels. A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">blog post from Sony</a> says the new character is named Atsu.</p>
<p>The blog post also says that <em>Yōtei</em> takes place in 1603, 300 years after the events of <em>Tsushima</em>.</p>
<p>Developer Sucker Punch hasn't revealed anything about the gameplay, though, beyond what we see in the trailer. So far, what we see looks almost identical to what we've played before. There are surely going to be more announcements to come, though.</p>

<p>As someone who has been following the growth of generative AI for a while now, I know that the technology <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/gmails-ai-powered-email-summaries-can-dig-through-your-inbox-for-you/">can be pretty good</a> (if <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/australian-government-trial-finds-ai-is-much-worse-than-humans-at-summarizing/">not quite human-level</a>) at quickly summarizing complex documents into a more digestible form. But I still wasn't prepared for how disarmingly compelling it would be to listen to <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">Google's NotebookLM</a> condense <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/how-bill-gates-minesweeper-addiction-helped-lead-to-the-xbox/">my recent book about <em>Minesweeper</em></a> into a tight, 12.5-minute, podcast-style conversation between two people who don't exist.</p>
<p>There are still enough notable issues with NotebookLM's audio output to prevent it from fully replacing professional podcasters any time soon. Even so, the podcast-like format is an incredibly engaging and endearing way to take in complex information and points to a much more personable future for generative AI than the dry back-and-forth of a text-based chatbot.</p>
<h2>Hey! Listen!</h2>
<p><em>Listen to NotebookLM's 12.5-minute summary of my <em>Minesweeper</em> book using the player above.</em></p>
<p>Google's NotebookLM <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-new-notebooklm-app-builds-a-custom-ai-based-on-a-source-document/">launched over a year ago</a> as "a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections—all based on the sources you select." Just last week, though, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">added the new "Audio Overview" feature</a> that it's selling as "a new way to turn your documents into engaging audio discussions."</p>
<p>Google doesn't use the word "podcast" anywhere in that announcement, instead talking up audio creations that "summarize your material, make connections between topics, and banter back and forth." But Wharton AI professor Ethan Mollick correctly referred to the style as a "podcast" in <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836480689081913572">a recent social media post</a> sharing a NotebookLM Audio Overview of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/059371671X?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AKD9E3789QQDK1S0240N">his book</a>. Mollick called these Audio Summaries "the current best 'wow this is amazing &amp; useful' demo of AI" and <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1836482214386671943">"unnerving, too,"</a> and we agree on both counts.</p>
<p>Inspired by Mollick's post, I decided to feed <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/minesweeper-by-kyle-orland">my own book</a> into NotebookLM to see what its virtual "podcasters" would make of 30,000 or so words about '90s Windows gaming classic <em>Minesweeper</em> (believe it or not, I could have written much more). Just a few minutes later, I was experiencing a reasonable facsimile of what it would be like if I was featured on <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510282/pop-culture-happy-hour">NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour</a> or a similar banter-filled podcast.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<h2>Just the facts?</h2>
<p>NotebookLM's summary hits on all the book's major sections: the pre-history of the games that inspired <em>Minesweeper</em>; the uphill battle for the Windows Entertainment Pack at a business-focused Microsoft of the '90s; the moral panic over the game's pre-installation on millions of business and government computers; and the surprising cheating controversies that surrounded the game's competitive scene.</p>

Sure, I could quibble about which specific bits the summary decided to focus on and/or leave out (maybe feeding different chapters individually would have led to more detail in the collected summaries). But anyone listening to this "podcast" would get the same general overview of my book that they would listening to <a href="https://codexhistoryofvideogames.libsyn.com/episode-262-minesweeper-with-kyle-orland">one</a> of the <a href="https://retronauts.com/article/2079/retronauts-episode-539-minesweeper-shareware">many</a> actual <a href="https://gamehistory.org/ep-110-minesweeper/">podcasts</a> that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-70840107/ep327-kyle-orland">I did</a> after the book launched.</p>
<p>While there weren't any full-blown, whole-cloth hallucinations in NotebookLM's summary "podcast," there were a few points where it got small details wrong or made assumptions that weren't supported in the text. Discussing <em>Minesweeper</em> predecessor <em>Mined-Out</em>, for instance, NotebookLM's audio summary says, "So this is where those squares and flags start to come into play..." even though <em>Mined-Out</em> had neither feature.</p>
<p>Then there's the portion where the summary-cast mentions a senator who called <em>Minesweeper</em> "a menace to the republic," repeating the quote for emphasis. That definitely captures the spirit of Senator Lauch Faircloth's tirade against <em>Minesweeper</em> and other games being pre-installed on government computers. In the "podcast" context, though, it sounds like the voices are putting words in Faircloth's mouth by sharing a direct quote.</p>
<p>Small, overzealous errors like these—and a few key bits of the book left out of the podcast entirely—would give me pause if I were trying to use a NotebookLM summary as the basis for a scholarly article or piece of journalism. But I could see using a summary like this to get some quick Cliff's Notes-style grounding on a thick tome I didn't have the time or inclination to read fully. And, unlike poring through Cliff's Notes, the pithy, podcast-style format would actually make for enjoyable background noise while out on a walk or running errands.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h2>It’s all in the delivery</h2>
<p>It's that naturalistic, bantering presentation that makes NotebookLM's new feature stand out from other AI products that generate capable text summaries. I felt like I was eavesdropping on two people who just happened to be discussing my book in a cafe, except those people don't actually exist (and were probably algorithmically designed to praise the book).</p>

<p>Right from the start, I was tickled by the way one "podcast host" described the book as a tale from "the land of floppy disks and dial-up modems" (a phrase I did not use in the book). That same voice goes on to tease "a bit of Bill Gates sneaking around the Microsoft office," up front, hinting at my absolute favorite anecdote from the book before fully exploring it later in the summary.</p>
<p>When they do get to that anecdote, the fake podcast hosts segue in with what feels like a natural conversational structure:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voice 1: It's hard to deny the impact of something when your own CEO is secretly hooked.<br>
Voice 2: Wait, are we talking about Bill Gates?</p></blockquote>
<p>The back-and-forth style of the two-person "podcast" format allows for some entertaining digressions from the main point of the book, too. When discussing the wormy movie-star damsel-in-distress featured in <em>Minesweeper</em> predecessor <em>Mined-Out</em>, for instance, the AI summarizers seem to get a little distracted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voice 1: I have to ask, what kind of movies does a worm even star in?<br>
Voice 2: I'm afraid that detail has been lost to the sands of gaming history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there's the casual way the two "hosts" bring up the improved versions of <em>Minesweeper</em> that were crafted to fix problems with Microsoft's original:</p>
<blockquote><p>Voice 1: So eventually the community came up with a more elegant solution.<br>
Voice 2: Let me guess. They created a new version of <em>Minesweeper</em>.<br>
Voice 1: Exactly.<br>
Voice 2: Called it a day on the old one.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two-person format helps foster a gentle, easy rhythm to the presentation of dense information, with natural-sounding pauses and repetition that help emphasize key points. When one ersatz podcaster talks about the phenomenon of "this incredibly addictive puzzle game [being] pre-installed on practically every computer," for instance, the other voice can answer back with the phrase "on every computer" with just the right amount of probing interest. Or when one AI voice intones that "it was discovered that the original <em>Minesweeper</em> had a flaw in how it generated random boards," the other voice jumps in and exclaims "A flaw!" with pitch-perfect timing and a sense of surprise.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
        
        
        
        <div>
          
          
<blockquote><p>Wait, are we talking about Bill&nbsp;Gates?</p><p><span>NotebookLM podcast voice</span></p></blockquote>
<p>There are some problems with this back-and-forth style, though. For one, both voices seem to alternate between the "I read the book" role and the "I'm surprised at these book facts you're sharing" role, making it hard to feel like either one is genuine. For another, the sheer volume of surprised reactions (a partial sample: "What? No! Wooooow! You're kidding! No way! You're blowing my mind here!") can get a little grating. And then there are the sentences that pause at the wrong points or the bits of laughter that feel like an editor chopped them off prematurely.</p>
<p>Still, when one fake podcast voice cooed, "Oh, do tell!" in response to the idea of controversy in competitive <em>Minesweeper</em>, it set off the same <a href="https://www.findapsychologist.org/parasocial-relationships-the-nature-of-celebrity-fascinations/">parasocial relationship</a> buttons that a good, authentic podcast can (while also effectively flattering my sense of authorial ego).</p>
<p>After listening to NotebookLM's summary of my own book, I can easily envision a near future where these "fake" podcasts become a part of my real podcast diet, especially for books or topics that are unlikely to get professional interest from human podcasters. By repackaging generative AI text into a "just two people chatting" format, Google has put a much more amiable face on what can sometimes seem like a dehumanizing technology.</p>

    <p><span>The PS5 Pro version of the 30th anniversary bundle comes with both varieties of DualSense controller, a plate for an (optional) optical drive, and other accessories.</span>

<p>Sony launched the original PlayStation console in Japan on December 3, 1994, and Sony isn't letting the 30th anniversary pass by quietly. Today the company has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/19/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-with-a-nostalgic-look/">announced</a> limited-edition versions of both the PS5 and PS5 Pro with gray plastic shells and multicolored PlayStation logos, inspired by the gray plastic shells of the original. The retro-inspired modern consoles will be released on November 21 and will be available for preorder starting September 26 from <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/">Sony's direct.playstation.com</a> site.</p>

<p>Sony is also releasing DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers with gray shells and colorful PS logo buttons and a gray version of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">Switch-esque PlayStation Portal streaming console</a>. Sony says that the limited-edition PS5 Pro will be limited to 12,300 units—a reference to the December 3 launch date—but didn't mention any specific manufacturing numbers for the regular PS5, either DualSense controller design, or the PlayStation Portal.</p>
<p>Both console bundles also come with a handful of other accessories: a PS logo sticker, a PS logo paperclip, cable ties, and (my personal favorite) a regular USB-C cable with a giant, chunky PS1-style controller connector on one end.</p>
<p>Though they're inspired by the original PlayStation, neither limited edition console comes with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/the-ps5-pro-brings-the-game-consoles-disc-drive-era-to-an-end/">a built-in optical drive</a>; however, they do include the gray plastic enclosure for anyone who chooses to add an $80 optical drive after the fact.</p>

<p>Sony has, notably, announced no pricing information for either console or any of the controllers or other accessories, though it almost doesn't matter—the nature of limited-edition gaming-related collectibles is such that enthusiasts and scalpers will snap these consoles up shortly after launch, regardless of whether Sony sells them at the usual MSRP or not.</p>
<p>Sony <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/limited-edition-original-grey-ps4-pays-homage-to-first-playstation/">released a similar PS1-inspired version of the PlayStation 4</a> for the PlayStation's 20th anniversary in 2014, and it <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=20th+anniversary+ps4&amp;_sacat=0&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Complete=1">still fetches a high price</a>—upward of $1,000 on eBay for used versions in good condition and between $1,500 and $2,000 for mint-in-box consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Last week, Rockstar added <a href="https://www.battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> support to <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, offering some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/gta-online-publisher-goes-after-paid-cheating-services/">much-needed</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/fortnite-gta-v-hackers-face-legal-action-for-online-cheating/">anti-cheat</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/rockstar-clears-out-illegitimately-gained-gta-online-cash/">protection</a> for the game's highly successful <em>GTA Online</em> multiplayer mode. That anti-cheat support wasn't welcome news for Steam Deck players, though, who now get confronted with an error when trying to log in to <em>GTA Online</em>.</p>
<p>According to Valve, though, Rockstar could solve this minor technical issue with a single email.</p>
<p>In both <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/271590/announcements/detail/6356356787200715685?snr=2___">a Steam Community update</a> and <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ">a Rockstar Support FAQ</a>, the developer notes that "Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for <em>GTA Online</em>. You will be able to play <em>GTAV</em> Story Mode but unable to play <em>GTA Online</em>." As such, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/"><em>GTA V</em>'s Steam page</a> now lists the game as "Unsupported" for Steam Deck users, because "the game's anti-cheat is not configured to support Steam Deck."</p>
<p>But BattlEye support on the Linux-based Steam Deck hasn't presented a technical problem to developers for years now. Back in late 2021, shortly before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">the Steam Deck's launch</a>, Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104663180636096966">wrote</a> that "BattlEye on Proton [and thus Steam Deck] integration has reached a point where all a developer needs to do is reach out [to] BattlEye to enable it for their title. No additional work is required by the developer besides that communication."</p>
<p>Shortly after that announcement, popular games including <em>ARK: Survival Evolved</em>, <em>DayZ</em>, and <em>Arma 3</em> all took advantage of that opportunity to support both BattlEye anti-cheat and Steam Deck compatibility at the same time. But many <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/AntiCheat/BattlEye/">other BattlEye titles on Steam</a>—including <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>The Crew 2</em>, <em>The Day Before</em>, and <em>Riders Republic</em>—have apparently not bothered to "reach out to BattlEye" to enable the same Steam Deck support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/after-20-years-world-of-warcraft-will-now-let-players-do-solo-raids/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After 20 years, it's now possible for solo players to finish storylines in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game <em>World of Warcraft</em> that previously required a group to do an intensive raid.</p>
<p>That's thanks to "<a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24137818/going-solo-in-world-of-warcraft-a-heros-journey">Story Mode</a>," a new raid difficulty that was added for the final wing of the first raid of the recently released <em>The War Within</em> expansion.</p>
<p>Over the years, developer Blizzard has expanded the difficulty options for raids to meet various players and communities where they are in terms of play styles. The top difficulty is Mythic, where the semi-pro hardcore guilds compete. Below that is Heroic, where serious, capital-G gamers coordinate with friends in weekly raid schedules to progress. Then there's Normal, which still requires some coordination but isn't nearly as challenging and can typically be completed within a few tries by a pick-up group.</p>
<p>The most accessible difficulty is Raid Finder, where you're matched with random players automatically to complete a vastly easier version of a raid. Now Story Mode has been added to the mix, and it's even easier than Raid Finder.</p>
<h2>How Story Mode works</h2>
<p>In Story Mode, you fight only the raid's final boss, which has been scaled back in stats and complexity so that it's beatable for a single player or a very small group of friends. Challenging encounter mechanics have been removed, and the whole fight has been retooled to focus exclusively on the narrative aspects.</p>
<p>There are some rewards, but they're not the same as those on more difficult raids; the goal was to avoid cheapening the experience for those who <em>do</em> want to go all the way.</p>
<p>So far, Story Mode is available exclusively for <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/world-of-warcraft/24135892/nerub-ar-palace-mythic-story-mode-raid-finder-wing-2-now-live">the newest raid</a>, which is called Nerub-ar Palace. It hasn't been made available for other encounters yet, but Blizzard has hinted that this could be the long-term goal.</p>
<h2>Supporting new (well, actually, old) play styles</h2>
<p>Throughout <em>WoW</em>'s history, it has been common for the conclusion of a major storyline to involve defeating the final boss of a raid or dungeon. In the earlier years, Raid Finder didn't exist, so only a small percentage of players who were willing to take on hardcore raiding could see those narrative outcomes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Age of Mythology: Retold is surprisingly playable with a controller]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/age-of-mythology-retold-is-surprisingly-playable-with-a-controller/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/age-of-mythology-retold-is-surprisingly-playable-with-a-controller.1000740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/age-of-mythology-retold-is-surprisingly-playable-with-a-controller/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Because of this, I ended up using the controller shortcuts for unit selection much more liberally—a tap of a D-pad direction to select a single villager or hero, for instance, or holding down another direction to auto-select all military units. Combining the left trigger with the D-pad to instantly select specific types of military units also quickly became second nature and a simple way to manage multiple small groups at once.</p>
<p>Managing unit groups without these built-in shortcuts, on the other hand, is a bit more laborious. First, you have to select a group of units by holding down the A button, creating a slowly expanding selection circle to encompass your desired group. Then, you hold down both shoulder triggers, tilt the analog stick, and tap X simultaneously to assign that group to a specific direction on a radial menu.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>A single radial menu is not enough here; note the "Find Units" page change button and the d-pad options on the sides.</span>
                    <span>
                      Microsoft
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>That's just as cumbersome as it sounds, as is switching between those groups after they've been assigned. Going from one selected group to another requires five distinct controller actions—hold down both shoulder buttons, tilt the joystick to the desired group, tap A, then let go of the shoulders and tap B to get back to the main game map.</p>
<h2>It works, but...</h2>
<p>Yes, it all technically works, but it's a lot of thumb and finger movement to keep track of for such a key action. And that feeling that there's a lot for my fingers to keep track of never really went away in general when using a controller on <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em>.</p>
<p>Even with a few hours of practice, I was often fumbling for a second or two to remember just what specific combination of buttons would lead to a desired in-game action. And while the game's interface does a good job popping up reminders of which buttons do what at a glance, I was still leaning on those reminders just a bit too much even after significant controller experience.</p>
<p>All in all, I was surprised at just how playable <em>Age of Mythology</em> was with a standard Xbox control pad. The experience is functional enough that I feel like Xbox owners playing on the couch and Steam Deck owners (or Xbox streamers) playing on a handheld can now get a "complete" experience with this classic game. Still, the annoyances associated with mapping an RTS like this to a controller remain large enough that I can't recommend a controller to anyone with access to a mouse and keyboard on their gaming rig.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft and Tencent are reportedly considering different options in order to stabilize the business and prevent further stock-price drops.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Ubisoft's Guillemot family and Tencent have reportedly discussed turning Ubisoft private, or even Tencent potentially buying out the company.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft are considering a buyout.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft">Bloomberg</a>, which noted the video game developer had lost more than half its market value over the year. </p>
<p>"The Chinese tech company and Guillemot Brothers Ltd have been speaking with advisers to help explore ways to stabilise Ubisoft and bolster its value," Bloomberg's report reads.</p>

<p>Those familiar with the situation said one possibility currently being discussed is "teaming up to take the company private".</p>
<p>Word of a buyout follows an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-investor-writes-open-letter-to-express-deep-dissatisfaction-with-company-performance">open letter from an Ubisoft investor to the company</a> last month, which expressed their "deep dissatisfaction" with its performance and strategic direction, urging the board to consider taking the company private.</p>
<p>This letter described Ubisoft as "a great company" that is "deeply undervalued" due to mismanagement from the Guillemot family and Tencent. In 2022, it was revealed Tencent had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-increases-stakes-in-ubisoft-with-300m-investment-in-guillemot-bros">49.9 percent stake in Guillemot Bros</a>.</p>
<p>Separately, at the end of April, Tencent owned 9.2 percent of Ubisoft's net voting rights.</p>
<p>Bloomberg noted any buyout considerations are still in the early stages. It is not certain these discussions will ultimately lead to a transaction taking place, with Tencent and the Guillemot family also said to be considering other options at this time.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment.</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft announced its upcoming release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now debut on 14th February 2025,</a> instead of its previously planned November arrival.</p>
<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">ultimately agreed to delay Shadows after seeing "softer than expected" sales for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has now reportedly just passed the 1m sales mark after launching on 30th August.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-hit-with-copyright-lawsuit-over-destiny-2s-red-war.1000710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has been hit with a copyright lawsuit by an author claiming that the ideas in the game's Red War campaign are stolen from one of his works.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-lawsuit-allegedly-copying-destiny-2-red-war/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first reported by TheGamePost</a>, author Kelsey Martineau is accusing Bungie of infringing work he created under the pen name of Caspar Cole back in 2013 and 2014, several years before the release of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit&nbsp;alleges that the characters involved in both&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s Red War and Martineau's works "display very similar attitudes, histories, and mindsets", and that "only through a very unique set of actions" is Earth invaded on both counts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-giant-mech.jpg?itok=o7t6hKJy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-giant-mech.jpg?itok=fSR8vIhj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>has been hit with a copyright lawsuit by an author alleging the Red War campaign infringes on his work.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the lawsuit, which appears to be referring to multiple Martineau works rather than any one single story, Martineau first published his stories on WordPress, which "allowed readers to easily search and explore content", including his published works.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges similarities like both stories involving "a young and ambitious alien" with the goal of "dividing and conquering Earth in order to gain strategic assets", as well as organizations named the Red Legion, both of which feature soldiers known as Legionnaires.</p>
<p>Both Red Legions are interested in "acquiring superweapons that can turn the tide" of the respective wars depicted in both works, according to the lawsuit, and both works "focus on concepts relating to consciousness transfer and the ethical dilemmas" arising from such technology.</p>
<p>Lest you think things aren't specific enough yet, don't worry; Martineau's lawsuit goes on to allege that a number of specific elements in his work were copied by Bungie for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-shooting.jpg?itok=zjpDFS08 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-copyright-lawsuit-shooting.jpg?itok=Ww9gNDyo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2</em>'s Red Legion has come under fire in a copyright lawsuit.</figcaption></figure><p>Specific elements Martineau claims Bungie copied include the backstory of Red War villain Dominus Ghaul, who's apparently very similar to a villain Martineau created called Yinnerah. Both of them lead their respective Red Legions, and they're both from humble beginnings.</p>
<p>Other similarities include&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s war beasts, which are apparently copied from animals in Martineau's work called "miogas", as well as superweapons called the Atonizer (in Martineau's work) and the Almighty (in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>).</p>
<p>The list of allegations is lengthy and involved, and you can <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/775926297/Bungie-Faces-Copyright-Lawsuit-For-Allegedly-Copying-Destiny-2-s-Red-War-Storyline#from_embed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the full lawsuit right here</a> (thanks again, TheGamePost) if you wish. Martineau's demands include the cessation of "manufacturing, producing...[and]...selling...materials that are substantially similar to&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>", as well as damages.</p>
<p>If the case goes ahead, it doesn't come at the best time for Bungie; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">let hundreds of employees go</a> back in July as part of a "new path", and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>is about to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence">embark on a new release schedule</a> as well. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

The genre has waned in popularity, and can often seem overshadowed by more standard live service titles, but <em>Throne and Liberty</em> aims to shake things up with creative class design, gorgeous visuals, and an engrossing progression experience. Here’s what you need to know about this new MMO on the block.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h160361"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Throne and Liberty?</strong></h2><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a Korean MMO developed by NCSOFT and published by Amazon Games. Set in the open world of Solisium, what was once intended to be a sequel to <em>Lineage</em> has now become a unique property, although maintains the fantasy setting.</p><p>It provides PVE fans with a sweeping tale that sees you leveling up, taking on dungeons, and working through a series of intense quests as you seek to face off against a potentially world-ending threat.</p><p>If the PVE adventure isn’t enough for you, however, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is also a very guild-focused MMO with a heavy emphasis on PVP. So if you want to see everything the game has to offer, you’ll be able to join a guild and work together to take on contracts and defeat other players in both massive and small-scale battles.</p><p><em>Throne and Liberty</em> offers a tab-targeting combat system and abides by the holy trinity of design: tank, healer, and DPS—roles that are required to overcome its most challenging dungeons and encounters. Despite sticking closely to that familiar formula, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> shakes things up a bit by offering a shocking amount of freedom in how you can approach classes.</p><h2 id="h160362"><a id=""></a><strong>How does <em>Throne and Liberty</em> handle classes?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-recommend-id="image://b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant lion/lizard beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant lion/lizard beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-recommend-id="image://b1a560b126aba3e1bd270c656ce38b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant lion/lizard beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike the average MMO, this game allows you to mix and match two main weapons to create any combination of your choosing. Do you want to wield a greatsword and a staff to become a badass battlemage? Cool! Go nuts slamming foes with your sword between casting fire and ice spells. Do you want to be a ranged DPS that can also heal? Combine the wand and tome with a longbow and unleash a flurry of arrows between casting restorative spells on you and your teammates.<br></p><p>While there are certainly meta combinations that allow for the very best stats for high-end PVE and PVP content, you never have to feel as if your off-meta pick will leave you out of the best parts of the game, as every combination can be a powerhouse in the right hands. Just choose what is most fun to you and go wild.</p><h2 id="h160363"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Throne and Liberty</em> free-to-play?</strong></h2><p>Like many modern MMOs, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> has adopted a free-to-play (F2P) model. This means you can download the game for free on your chosen platform and play it forever without paying any type of subscription.</p><p>However, the game’s F2P design means that NCSOFT has implemented battle passes that can be purchased with real money, as well as an in-game shop where players can buy cosmetics, like outfits and transformations, and leveling passes that drastically improve the leveling experience that would otherwise require you to grind.</p><p>With this in mind, some may consider the game pay-to-win (P2W), but it’s not quite as egregious as similar titles. All of the gear and items can be obtained in the game simply by playing, but players who wish to speed up gear acquisition can do so.

<p>A major change could be coming at Ubisoft sooner rather than later. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the founders of Ubisoft, the Guillemot family, are considering a buyout from Tencent.</p>



<p>The discussions come after what’s been the most tumultuous year in the company’s history. Ubisoft has seen its shares <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fall to 11-year lows</a>, games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws have struggled to sell</a>, and its biggest franchise, Assassin’s Creed, has seen its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game delayed</a> into 2025.</p>







<p>“The Chinese tech company and&nbsp;Guillemot Brothers Ltd.&nbsp;have been speaking with advisers to help explore ways to stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value,” the Bloomberg report states. </p>



<p>It’s said that one of the options on the table would involve taking the company private. That said, talks are “at an early stage” with no certainty that an agreement will be reached. </p>



<p>“Tencent and the Guillemot family are also considering other alternatives,” sources told Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The idea of Ubisoft going private isn’t new. Recently, there’s been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major push</a> from smaller investors to do just that. It’s even gotten support from at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investor-says-it-has-support-of-10-shareholders-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% of the company’s shareholders</a>.</p>



<p>Tencent currently owns 10% of Ubisoft, the company founded by the Guillemot family in 1986. CEO Yves Guillemot has been in his position since 1988, but, as part of the aforementioned push for a sale by investors, has seen requests for his removal.</p>



<p>Neither Ubisoft nor Tencent have commented publicly on this report. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-sparks-metal-gear-speculation-by-teasing-return-to-role<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>David Hayter, the veteran voice behind Metal Gear’s Solid Snake, has teased a return to the iconic role he last played over a decade ago.</p><p>Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima controversially replaced Hayter as Snake with 24 star Kiefer Sutherland for 2015’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</a>. Hayter last played Snake in 2010’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a>.</p><p>But could a return be on the cards? That certainly seems likely following a cryptic tweet from Hayter himself. “I was in the booth today,” he said. “Playing a role I’ve not played, since…” Hayter followed that tweet up with a gif of Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/s15E4YlW2u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/s15E4YlW2u</a></p>— David Hayter (@DavidBHayter) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBHayter/status/1842129046991417481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>At first glance it looks like Hayter is in the booth to record Snake voice lines for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the hotly anticipated remake of Metal Gear Solid 3. However, Konami has confirmed Delta uses the same dialogue audio as the original Snake Eater and thus all cinematics are frame-for-frame and line-for-line identical.</p><p>So, what’s Hayter teasing? Fans have all sorts of theories. It could be promotional work for Metal Gear Solid Delta, or extra content set to come with the game. Alternatively, it could be voice work for an upcoming Sonic fan film called Sonic Villains, which Hayter is meant to be voicing Solid Snake for as part of an unofficial cameo.</p><p>More exciting is the suggestion that Hayter is reprising his role as Snake for an unannounced Metal Gear Solid game. If that’s true, what could it be?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Metal Gear Review</h3></div></output><p>In June last year, fans spotted that inspecting the Metal Gear Solid timeline page on the official Metal Gear Solid website revealed placeholder buttons for Metal Gear Solid 4, Metal Gear Solid 5, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker — <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-4-finally-freed-from-ps3-as-part-of-leaked-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2"><u>three games IGN understands will indeed form a part of the unannounced Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</u></a>. Perhaps Hayter is recording new voice work for one or all of these games. Or maybe Konami has a brand new Metal Gear game up its sleeve and Hayter has parachuted in to reprise the role.</p><p>It’s a mystery for now, but we can perhaps rule out a remake of the first Metal Gear Solid game. Konami recently said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-says-remaking-metal-gear-solid-1-would-be-harder-than-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">remaking the groundbreaking original would be much more complicated than its incoming Metal Gear solid 3 remake</a> because it would require the creation of many brand new elements.</p><p>"Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview"><u>IGN said in our </u>Metal Gear Solid Delta <u>preview</u></a>.

Now Atari and IDW Publishing have joined forces to release a Yars Rising prequel comic.</p><p>With the preorder deadline for Yars Rising #1 happening on Monday, October 7, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of the first issue. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Yars Rising Prequel Comic: Exclusive Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Yars Rising #1 is a one-shot special written by WayForward's Adam Tierney and drawn by Ele Bruni, with cover art by Ashleigh Hetrick. As the preview shows, the comic retains the unusual anime-inspired aesthetic of the game. The comic is set before the events of the game, as hacker extraordinaire Emi Kimura and her friends deal with the consequences of a job gone bad.</p><p>"I'm thrilled to be working with Atari and IDW on the official Yars Rising one-shot comic book prequel," Tierney tells IGN. "While developing the Yars Rising video game, I loved writing dialog for our crazy hacker crew of Emi, Mal, Anthony, and Kyan. So it was a blast to revisit these characters in comic book format, and see how they work together in an earlier (but just as dangerous) adventure that takes place right at Emi's home. I couldn't think of a better publisher for this book than IDW or a more perfect artist than the amazing Ele Bruni. I hope everyone enjoys the Yars Rising video game, out now on PC and consoles, and very soon, the official comic book prequel, too!"</p><p>Yars Rising #1 is priced at $4.99 will be released on November 13, 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more upcoming comics, check out IGN's picks for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-new-comic-book-releases-of-october-2024">the biggest new comic book releases of October 2024</a> and see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mrballen-presents-strange-dark-mysterious-graphic-novel-preview">an exclusive preview of MrBallen Presents: Strange, Dark &amp; Mysterious</a>.</p><p><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
