			<p>New Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 footage was shared online, providing a better look at how the demanding open-world by CD Projekt Red runs and looks on the next-generation Nintendo system in handheld mode.</p>
<p>The footage, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deck Wizard</a>, shows the game running on the system in Performance Mode, which targets 40 FPS. While there are some visible frame rate drops at times, which are likely to be addressed in the launch version, the game really seems to run great on Nintendo Switch 2 while also sporting great image quality, showing how the Nintendo system is more than capable of delivering a better experience than what can be achieved on Steam Deck.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Verdansk is breathing new life into Call of Duty Warzone, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The internet had declared Activision’s now five year-old battle royale “cooked” before the nostalgia-fueled Verdansk turned things around. Now, the internet has declared Warzone “back.” Didn't Activision nuke Verdansk? It doesn't seem to matter, as lapsed players who fondly remember Warzone as their lockdown game are returning to the map that started it all, and those who stuck with the game through thick and thin over the past five years are saying Warzone is more fun now than it’s been since it exploded onto the scene in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This back-to-basics gameplay experience was a deliberate design decision on the part of developers Raven and Beenox. Pete Actipis, game director on Warzone at Raven, and Etienne Pouliot, creative director at Beenox, both worked on the multi-studio effort to bring Warzone back. In this sweeping interview with IGN, the pair discuss how they went about it, the success of Verdansk’s Casual mode, reveal whether they considered limiting operator skins to mil-sim for a more 2020 feel, and answer the crucial question: is Verdansk here to stay?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I imagine I fit the typical profile, which is someone who played a lot of Warzone during lockdown and was enticed back by the return of Verdansk. Was that the point of all this, to get lapsed Warzone fans back in the game? And now it’s been out for a while, is that what you’re seeing happening?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We hit our fifth year anniversary for Warzone and we wanted to bring back Verdansk for quite some time now. It just felt like the right timing. When we were talking about bringing it back, it wasn't just bringing back the map. It was more than that. Over the last five years we have learned a lot, experimented with a lot. The one thing you can say about Warzone, it's constantly changing for good or for bad. It is something that we just try to keep evolving. And we listen to the players and we take some shots and sometimes they land, sometimes they don't. But when we talked about bringing Verdansk back, it was very important for us to bring back a nostalgic moment in time as best as we could and be respectful of that as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Covid it was just a special time in the world, it was crazy, it was something that we all experienced together individually, but Warzone created this social experience in a way that was pretty new to Call of Duty. So we wanted to pay homage to that as best as we could. We looked at every single component of what made Warzone special back in 2020 and we wanted to really treat it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll let Etienne talk about the map side of it, but at least on the gameplay side, we wanted to make sure that we looked at all the design principles and all the reasons that we added the things that we did back then, and are they still viable? Are those still fun mechanics and loops? And if we were to bring them back, we wanted to make sure we did it with the right intent. And that's why I think it's stuck around so well. Post-launch, right now it's getting great feedback from the community. They seem to really be enjoying it. We're players too, so we wanted to build an experience that we fell in love with back in 2020. So yeah, it's worked out. We're really careful about what we do to the game right now because we hit that sweet spot of that nostalgia bit and people seem to be enjoying it. So we're pretty excited by it as players too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> We know that gaming in general goes pretty fast. Five years of Warzone just went by really, really fast, and we've tried so many things. But each day Verdansk was still in the discussion and in the bucket of ideas of, ‘oh we will need to return to that place someday.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was just not a matter of, 'oh we're going to port that thing toward that new engine or that new Call of Duty.' It was really more like, ‘let's bring the best version of Verdansk.’ So, just to be sure that we remade everything from the ground, the sky, the player visibility, the audio. There is a lot of stuff that we put a lot of energy in. And we see the result right now. We were playing the game and we were like, 'yeah, it feels great.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we were just eager to give it to the player. And the answer is really successful right now. So we are really, really happy. And just like Pete mentioned, I think it's only a beginning and we'll continue to challenge ourselves to see if we need to make some changes, improvements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The online sentiment does look positive right now, and you’ll know that the online sentiment across places like Reddit and social media has certainly not always been positive about Warzone. Is that something that you're seeing in the data? Are you seeing more people returning to play Warzone?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> It has been pretty successful, and I think you can tell in the experience, right? Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it. Like Etienne said, we recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We knew there was going to be a lot of new players or lapsed players, word of mouth of like, 'hey come check out Verdansk.' We added this Casual mode, which is doing really well for us. We wanted players to come in and re-experience it at their pace, or experience it for the first time in a safe way where they don't feel like they're getting sweated out or outplayed. We were very careful with crafting this experience this season, and the data is showing us that it's been really successful and we just hope to keep that momentum going into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, it's really impressive how much Call of Duty touches different players from all different backgrounds. We've seen that during the pandemic and we've seen that today. So it's really a privilege to work on that level of successful franchise. We have that approach of, we want as many players as we can. So having that Casual mode, having more quality of life, having more ways to have a stable, performant game is really important. Down the rest of that chapter and so for the rest of Warzone, how can we be a place to welcome new players and make sure that if you were there back then you will return to what you love?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Casual mode is where I’m playing right now as a lapsed player returning to Warzone. However, I am starting to see the sweats maybe looking at Casual mode and going, ‘we can have some fun here.’ You can tell when you're playing it when someone shouldn't be there, this is too easy for you. Are you seeing that internally?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> The whole spirit of the Casual mode was to give people that were scared about getting into a time commitment or a game commitment or a skill commitment with Warzone, but do it on their terms. The nice thing about this is, this is the first rev of it. It just went live and we're going to look at the data, we're going to evolve it over time to make sure it retains the design principles and spirit that we wanted it to have. So if we see sweats come in there wrecking the whole server, then we will have to come up with plans against that. It's still pretty new right now. I think it's still giving players what they need in it right now, and we'll just keep monitoring and involving it. But it's a fun mode. I can't lie - I enjoy playing it myself and I can play with people that never played Call of Duty before. It's a little less intimidating that way, and I think that's what makes it so appealing for myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And you get the sense of learning the tension of the game. It's not just you get thrown away and after that you go to the Gulag and that's it, it's done. Internally we have a lot of great players, and maybe we call them 'demon players.' It's funny to just have those discussions with them about the game and how they see it, how they approach it. And on my side, me I'm more on the downfall skill player - I was great before and now I'm just getting worse and worse. So I think it's really important to just have those conversations with those great players and see how we can tweak that experience in a way that everyone gets something out of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I'm pretty sure that we have a lot of players who are going to get inside ranked down the road of BR. So I see that as a more broad, different mode to just engaging depending on your skillset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Yeah, I guess when ranked starts, the sweats will probably gravitate towards that and they'll have had their fun. I want to talk to you about Call of Duty lore. I remember reporting on Warzone and how everything became unified and all the different brands became mashed together in a timeline. And I remember in 2021 you blew Verdansk up, and it was publicly said: </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-no-return-new-map"><strong>‘this is never coming back.’</strong></a><strong> And I believed it! So are we just supposed to go, ‘you know what, actually it doesn't really matter, it's about the fun.’ Or have you come up with a story explanation for how we're back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> I don't want to spoil any sort of narrative story bits. And that's not confirming nor denying either way. It's just, what we wanted to do for this moment was take a pause from any sort of timelines or anything like that and just say, 'look, let's just celebrate this moment in time and just have a great time with it.' If and when we introduce a narrative we may or may not figure out if we have to resolve this. But again, I'm not trying to spoil anything or say or mislead in any direction. But this season's launch was just, let's have a fun moment and go back to the nostalgic bits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And I don't know if you've seen some clips around it, but all I can say is that there is stuff in the map that I'm pretty sure that players who know the map will definitely find some bits of information. And after that they can figure it out. But at the same time it's important to acknowledge some of the historical moments of five years of Warzone. So Verdansk is part of that five year celebration.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: A lot of people are wondering, is Verdansk here to stay? Is it like a celebration, one-shot type thing that you're doing, or is this something that players can expect longer term and you iterate on it on that basis?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We brought Verdansk back for a reason. It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it. So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there. So again, no confirmation or anything on the strategy on the maps moving forward, but we love Verdansk. It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve seen players go back to unlock Price’s ghillie suit from Modern Warfare 2 now Verdansk is back. Have you seen this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, I've seen that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: People are asking each other how to get it again, going back to Modern Warfare 2 or even buying it to unlock the ghillie suit.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> It's really interesting how the community is engaging with the game. We have the chance of having all the different operators from Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, and all the different games. It's something that I really love from the game, is that all the different battle passes and Blackcell, I can change every time my loadout and my operator. And sometimes I even use really, really old weapons that maybe are not meta, but I have the feeling that I'm back, I'm there the way I want to play. So I'm pretty sure a lot of people are just using all the different content we gave them across all those years and having fun right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> On launch day I went back and picked an old Ghost costume that looked very similar to the launch trailer versions. I'm like, 'okay, I'm back in it too.' That's part of the fun, picking your operator and the look and trying to relive that moment as you remember it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve been having old debates again about whether to play aggressive or just camp on a rooftop and snipe, or just hide, in the same old places. When you were thinking about bringing back the map, did you consider tweaking it in such a way to encourage certain gameplay types or gameplay styles, or did you want to recreate it as accurately as possible so the same gameplay styles in the same places would happen once again?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> We wanted to recreate those moments, but again, we've learned a lot. So just to give you a quick example: player visibility is really better right now than back then. Maybe people will remember Roze, but there were a lot of dark corners. That was an experience that a lot of people were not attracted by. So we've made slight adjustments like this to make sure it's fun for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And another thing is audio was really, really, really important for us. So just making sure that you understand from each corner where you're in this, where will be the enemy, and how you need to react. So again, just making sure that it's the best Verdansk version we will deliver. That was the goal and I think that we are on the right path to continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis: </strong>We also didn't want change too much because then it wouldn't be what you remembered in Verdansk. The map itself had a lot of that sandbox-y kind of like, 'do I want to play long range and go camp at the top of ATC Tower or the top of Stadium roof with a helicopter?' There was a lot of play potential, a lot of opportunities for close range, long range, you name it; great fighting in the woods areas north of Quarry, or south west of Hills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make that a reality we went back into the core experience and made sure we were able to pay those moments off. So we retuned the circle back the way it worked originally. So we allow these wild swings for these first and last circles so you can get more of these dynamic and crazy experiences where you're, the first part of the match you're playing in a dense area, maybe like Downtown, and then it ends somewhere where there's an opening, and you're like, ‘oh crap, I got to go hit my loadout again, let's go get some money so we can acquire a loadout so I can get more of a mid to long range weapon to be able to handle late game.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also made vehicles more impactful, so we had to remove things like the redeploy drone beacons and all the other fast travel mechanics, to make the rotations a little bit more difficult, which made you think of, ‘how do I want to move with my team and what kind of weapons do I need to carry and what sort of equipment do I carry?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of those things might look like individual things, but they all compound together to really form the experience. And so we were very careful. It was like, ‘what's the experience that we really want to go after when we brought back Verdansk?’ So then that started peeling back the onion of, ‘okay, we have to change this, we should change this and this and this.’ And so all of it together as the sum of the parts of that beat that we were going after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to get some insight into TTK (Time to Kill) and how you approached what you wanted to achieve there for Verdansk coming back. It feels shortened to me, but exactly what happened there, and why did you make the changes you made?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> Comparatively to last year, the Urzikstan year, it is a faster TTK. It's pretty equivalent - I don't know the exact numbers offhand - but the original experience and what we wanted to go back for now was make it more of a casual, friendly kind of, ‘if I'm not good at hitting straight shots, I have an opportunity, I'm not going to get destroyed every gun battle.’ There's also a lot more excitement of like, ‘oh, I have an opportunity to get a kill.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it is not like we're trying to remove skill from the game. There's still a lot of skill involved in this game, but it's approachable, which is the key difference there. And part of this was not only how do weapons handle, but then also how does your movement handle in response to that? Do I feel like I can engage in combat and get a bead on somebody and react to how someone's moving or get away from shots?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So movement and gunplay are very tied to the hip. And this is again the peeling onion approach. We like right now where the TTK sits. We will evaluate as the game progresses and see what our fans think. We're always evolving and we'll react appropriately based on that. But right now it seems like people are enjoying it. I know TTK is... some people either love it or they hate it. It depends on their player type. It's okay to be opinionated. That's cool! We're just trying to do what's best for the community at large.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: My first Verdansk match back I was in the plane and there were four of us getting ready to jump out, and one of the players was a giant Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and the other was this fairy thing. I was like, 'this is not how Warzone was back in lockdown.' Was that on your minds as you were thinking of rekindling the feeling exactly as it was back then, when some of these crazy skins weren't so prevalent in the game? Did you ever think at any point that actually, just for the relaunch, at least at the start, we're going to limit it to mil-sim [military simulation] stuff, or some of the stuff that people remembered? Or was that just never a consideration for you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We talked about everything. We left no stone unturned really. But we wanted to create the best version of Verdansk possible. And part of that is just understanding the reality of where we're at. We're in a Black Ops 6 year. So at the end of the day we still are dealing with differences in loadouts and weaponry and even operators. We tried to pay homage and pay off the spirit of that nostalgic experience as best as possible. But our intent was never to be a facsimile of that old experience. It was supposed to be the best version of Verdansk and Warzone to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that was respecting players’ purchases. As a player, I've invested X amount of time, money, whatever it is, and this is who I like to play with. Okay, we could have restricted weapons and operators, but then it creates this big friction moment for players who are like, 'I just want to play the game. I want to have fun in my mode.' I know some players might have more of a stance on it, like, ‘I want it to be pure mil-sim.’ But the spirit was to make it welcoming for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> I remember sometime with my friend, we were like, 'yeah, today we all buy a different turtle and we wanted to be the four turtles winning a match. It was pretty crazy. So I think just having those possibilities in front of the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mil-sim - one of my friends is really hardcore, he plays only with one attachment. That's his rule. Because he feels that it's cheating. He's like, 'no, it's not a usable case of a weapon. So I will only use one.' And I'm like, ‘okay man, if you want to do it, but I will never go toward that path.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think that just having all those different possibilities so you can engage the way you want. And after that, like Pete just mentioned, I think that it's really important for us to respect all the time and money you spend in the game and making sure it's still worth it for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your friend must be very good at Call of Duty if they can get by with just one attachment.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, it's really incredible how many people I've seen through all the years that they have such a great skill that from my point of view I'm like, ‘hey, are you using something else that I'm not aware of?’ But yeah, you're a true player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: That does lead me on to one of the final questions I wanted to ask. Activision has increased communication around cheating in Warzone and made changes recently, like with crossplay. But are you seeing any improvements now with Verdansk coming back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> To be honest with you, that's not our area of expertise, the whole cheating side. I would defer those questions to the Ricochet team and how that stuff has been working out. Anecdotally, the games have been feeling good. I don't feel like I'm getting cheated on. I think that's even what our streamers are saying. But again, that's not really a data point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And something just to add, it's just that it's always something on top of our mind. So we're just making sure that the right person speaks with the right team and makes sure that we put a lot of effort. Because everything we saw from the community, it's important for us too. So just making sure that yeah, we will put all the energy needed to prevail and making sure the game is at the right condition that we want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have any message to the community about your plans for Warzone in 2025 now that you've gotten to a place where there's positive sentiment? What can players expect?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> First of all, thank you for either coming back or continuing with us on this Warzone journey. We are players too and we strive to make the game as good as possible. The launch of Verdansk, the simplification of our systems and our mechanics and just the flow, is the beginning. We're going to cultivate the game and we're pretty excited for our roadmap moving forward. We've got some great surprises that I'm not going to spoil today in store, but we hear the community and we want feedback. We listen. We take all opinions. We have our own, and we like hearing what the players think and feel. The passion is really important for us because that fuels us. We're excited to continue on with our journey here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, totally. The first thing is just to thank all the players for all the love. And even the bad things. I think it's important to know both sides of the community. We're all passionate, and we have a lot of great ideas that are coming down the path. Warzone has so much room to continue to grow and opportunity in front of us. So I just hope that with all the different players we will get to those moments, and after that they will stick as memories for them for quite a long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>One of the first things that struck me when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> is just how complicated the control scheme can get. There’s button combos and sequences that feel more like what you’d expect of a fighting game than of an action RPG, and the four boss battles we tried demonstrated such a variety of individual game mechanics beyond the typical fare. Heck, there’s some Spider-Man style web-swinging thrown in for one of them!</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn1igh_q0Wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Crimson Desert is an interesting game project in its own right. Originally thought of as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, it’s morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with that oh so familiar “if you can see it, you can go there” sensibility to the huge world that they’ve constructed.</p>


<p>It does, however, feel rather generic in a number of ways. The continent of Pywel is beset by war between two factions, the warmongering Black Bears and the peace-seeking Greymanes. Naturally you’re aligned with the latter faction, playing as their leader, Kliff, whose most immediately distinctive characteristic is having some blue stripes down one side of his face.</p>
<p>The other quite striking characteristic from playing the game’s opening battle sequence should be how full of holes he is, after being resoundingly beaten and stabbed by the Black Bears leader Myudrin. It’s alright, though. He gets better again, and we jumped ahead to sample those four main boss battles.</p>


<p>The Staglord is certainly the most conventional, a big, powerful warlord who leaps and charges to close the gap to you before dishing out hefty sword attacks that will send you flying if they land. It’s a fight where I came out ahead despite feeling that I was constantly losing – and truth be told, I did have to rely on the healthy stocks of restorative Veal Burgers that Pearl Abyss had pre-filled Kilff’s pockets with.</p>
<p>Even here, the complexity of the game’s combat controls was clear to see. There’s naturally light and heavy attacks, parrying and countering, and you need to be aware of your snail-like stamina meter on screen, but anything beyond the basics needs button combos. Pairs of face buttons pressed together pull of things like a sweeping reverse slash, trigger a flurry attack to deal a rapid sequence of blows, and more.</p>
<p>I needed to rely on more of these extended techniques for the other boss battles. Fighting Hexe Marie, a witch who can turn into a murder of crows and summon pot-headed automatons to swarm you, brought plenty of other challenges, and opportunities to master some other techniques. The key to defeating her was really about bringing explosive arrows to the party, helping to blast her minions into chunks of crockery.</p>

<p>What I didn’t quite get a hang of, through the barrage of inputs and combos I needed to learn, was force shoving Kliff up into the air, triggering his Pecision Focus slow-mo ability, and then unleashing a rapid flurry of arrows all together. It looks great in the gameplay tutorials I saw, but I didn’t really manage to pull it off myself.</p>
<p>Not even at the second attempt, when facing the Reed Devil, a very fast and very elusive masked enemy that you fight in the middle of a field of wheat. Once again, I was getting slapped around by a boss, though this time, his weakness was on clear display with a series of protective totems to try and take out.</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed that, where the Staglord came to a timely demise, Hexe-Marie and Reed Devil leant into the kind of comic book defeats that let them slink away to fight another day. There’s some great action in the mini cutscenes that mark the switch between health bars for each boss, the compliments the over-the-top combat abilities nicely, not to mention the flashy particle effects that compliment so many attacks. It’s like you’re fighting with a Catherine Wheel in hand instead of a large sword, as a shower of sparks is unleashed around you.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting boss, albeit the one that we spent the least time with, was against Queen Stoneback Crab. This rock-covered hill of a creature brings in a touch of the Shadow of the Colossus, as you have to clamber up her back as she bucks and rears to try and fling you into the sky –&nbsp;which can easily lead to your death from falling, if you forget or don’t know the button to press to start gliding back down with the Crow’s Wing ability.</p>
<p>You’re searching for a handful of silvery patches to smash and then stab through to release a poisonous affectation that is altering her behaviour, and eventually give you the opening to Spider-Man grapple to her, swing yourself around and come smashing down on a pile of pots at the top of her shell.</p>
<p>We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.</p>

			<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the United States could increase significantly, according to a supplier.</p>
<p>An internal assessment memo from a major unnamed Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns">Nikkei Asia</a> highlights how game consoles made in China <a href="https://wccftech.com/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-have-reportedly-excluded-pc-smartphone-imports/">are still subject to a 145% tariff </a>in the United States, which means that the Nintendo Switch 2, which is primarily made in China, is in line for a significant price increase over the announced launch price of $449.99. The PlayStation 5 is also primarily made in China, so a price hike in the United States is also expected for Sony's system, which has already seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">a price increase</a> in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>As Nikkei Asia pointed out in today's report, the Nintendo Switch 2 is also being produced in Vietnam.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/"> Last week</a>, we learned that Hosiden Corp shipped quite a few units to the United States last February, more than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. Judging from today's report, however, it seems more and more unlikely that the number of units produced in Vietnam will be enough to prevent the system's price from increasing, given the vast majority of units are still produced in China.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for China, where the console has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely</a>.

<p>Schedule 1 players have been warned about malware in some of the game’s most popular mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/certain-schedule-1-mods-confirmed-to-contain-trojan-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, the official Schedule 1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jx6vl8/urgent_psa_malware_found_in_2_popular_schedule_1/?share_id=AvZ_njVPdRrRpo99mWvCM&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has released an “URGENT PSA” for its members, bringing their attention to malware found in popular mods. Players have been advised to uninstall these mods instantly, or they could get in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-mods-that-were-found-with-malware">Schedule 1 Mods That Were Found with Malware</h2>



<p>The first Schedule 1 Mod found with malware is Froggyp1’s “Increased Stack Size Limit.” The subreddit moderator has confirmed that the original creator has sold their account, and the new owner has introduced a version “which is VERIFIED to be a trojan.” The owner has been banned, and their malicious uploads removed; however, players should look through their files to be sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Schedule 1 mod in question is “Backpack Mod Reupload,” and this time, even NexusMods have confirmed that it is malware. After deleting the files and changing their passwords, players can take two suggested actions: First, they can use reputable anti-virus or anti-malware software to search individual files for malware. The other way is to use online virus scanning services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creator of Schedule 1 has provided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a console port update</a> after imitations appeared on PlayStation. Also, its recent update added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Pawn Shop and a Boutique</a>.

            <p>Director Eli Roth has shared his thoughts on what went wrong with last year's Borderlands adaptation, which was a critical and commercial flop.</p>
<p>Why did it fail? Well, Roth believes that the circumstances around the film, such as the Covid pandemic, certainly didn't do the team any favours.</p>

<p>In conversation with podcast <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/">The Town</a> (via <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/eli-roth-reflects-on-borderlands-difficulties/">Dark Horizons</a>), Roth admitted that the first time he got to view the final film, he wasn't actually sure what he was going to see. This is because Roth had already started work on another film, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-film-director-takes-reigns-on-borderlands-reshoots">Deadpool film director Tim Miller had taken over Borderlands' reshoots</a>.</p>
<p>"[I] was doing Thanksgiving, and it's also the kind of thing we're like, wow, this is the first time I'm going to see a movie sort of being like, 'OK, I directed this, what happens?'. That was kind of an experience like, never had that before," Roth said.</p>
<p>"And I remember being... Am I at the point of my career where I'm going to sit down to watch my own movie that says I wrote and directed it, and I really genuinely don't know what's going to happen?"</p>
<p>The director still has plenty of respect for those that worked on the film, and said he would still work with Lionsgate again, but not "under those circumstances".</p>
<p>Roth continued:  "I think none of us, none of us anticipated how complicated things were gonna be with Covid. Not just in terms of what we're shooting, but then you have to do pick-up shots or reshoots and you have six people that are all on different sets and every one of those sets is getting shut down because the cities have opened up, and now there's a Covid outbreak and it was just like... we couldn't prep in a room together, I couldn't be with my stunt people, I couldn't do pre-vis, everyone's spread all over the place.</p>
<p>"You can't prep a movie on that scale over Zoom and I think we all thought we could pull it off and we got our asses handed to us a bit."</p>

<p>Last year's Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands adaptation was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. The film generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick had a more upbeat outlook on the Borderlands adaptation, however. Indeed, he said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">the "disappointing" movie hadn't hurt the Borderlands video game series, but rather it had given it a boost</a>.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Borderlands games franchise is due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">release across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>) on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Borderlands director has stated that the movie flopped because of COVID, as you can’t create a large-scale movie on Zoom Calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an appearance on <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Town</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/eli-roth-on-why-the-borderlands-movie-sucked-you-cant-prep-a-movie-on-that-scale-over-zoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>), Borderlands director Eli Roth elaborated on how COVID and Zoom Calls hindered the movie’s development. Roth explained that none of them could have predicted “how complicated things were gonna be with COVID,” and the complications became visible not just while shooting but in other processes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-movie-failed-due-to-covid-and-zoom">Borderlands Movie Failed Due to COVID and Zoom</h2>



<p>Roth added that it was total chaos for them, having to do reshoots and pick-up shoots, having six people across different sets, and having each one shut down when a city opened up. More complications were added when there was a COVID outbreak in the area, which meant they “couldn’t prep in a room together,” meet their stunt people or do any pre-visualisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roth concludes, “ You can’t prep a movie on that scale over Zoom”. They thought that they would be able to pull off Borderlands with COVID and Zoom calls; instead, Roth explains, “We got our asses handed to us a bit.”</p>



<p>Borderlands movie had a disappointing release, standing at 10% on the Tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans were highly disappointed with the deviation from the source material and some of the casting choices for their favourite characters. However, it wasn’t all bad, as Take-Two’s CEO recently stated that the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped sell games</a> even though it was ‘disappointing’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025. What are your thoughts on the Borderlands director blaming COVID and Zoom calls for the movie’s failure?

            <p>I've heard things, Microsoft, and I think I'd rather die.

Actual human immortality is due to launch by Q2 of 1999, and then all I'll have to do is upload my soul to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavenx">HeavenX</a>. This means I'll miss both the UK TV debut of The Sopranos <em>and</em> Roy Walker's final episode of Catchphrase but, eh, swings and roundabouts.</p>
<p>But, wait, there's anomalies in the system. Typical millennium shit. You know how it is. To fix them, you'll need to enter cyberspace and play with guns and cards. HeavenX bills itself as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> deckbuilder but stands out through 1. Exactly the kind of break beats I like writing to 2. Looking like the inside of your eyelids might if you pressed your fingers into your eyes for a bit after staring at a screensaver for three hours. You bet your sweet Roy Walker's final episode of Catchphrase I'm down. I couldn't find a trailer so just look at these cards with me for a bit.</p>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> will allow players to repair their equipment using the new accompanying app.</p>
<p>In both games, breakable equipment is a controversial inclusion. It forces players to experiment with new weapons, but losing a favourite mid-fight can be frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, though, there's a new way to repair your equipment. Nintendo is updating its app alongside the games, which we already know will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">include achievements, voiced navigation, and all-new memories</a>.

<p>Each day, players will be able to roll a roulette wheel for a daily bonus to be activated at any point in-game.</p>
<p>These bonuses (as spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-n0v0mpBVM&amp;t=594s">Zeltik</a>) include health restoration, energy cell recharges, various meals, and equipment repairs. The latter will allow players to use their chosen weapons a little longer.</p>
<p>Players may worry this will upset the balance of the game, but the bonus can only be used once each day. What's more, Zeltik noted the roulette wheel appears to be different each day, so repairs may not always be available.</p>
<p>It's a nice addition, though, to give players an extra option when their favourite sword is close to breaking point mid-battle against a Lynel.</p>
<p>While the Switch 2 editions provide a boost to the visual performance of both games, last week Nintendo confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild won't include its paid DLC</a>.

<p>Another<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-looks-to-be-streamlining-screenshot-and-video-sharing-so-its-less-of-a-faff"> improvement on the app will be streamlining screenshot and video capture</a> and sharing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> is getting more expensive again in Europe, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, Sony has announced. In all of these regions the digital edition PS5 is jumping up in price, while Aus &amp; NZ are also seeing the PS5 with disc drive also get more expensive. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> pricing is unaffected, though, and the standalone disc drive is getting cheaper.</p>
<p>Here’s the new console pricing which is coming into effect today.</p>


<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Europe</strong></td>
<td>PS5 Digital Edition – €499.99<br>
<em>(No pricing changes for the standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive) </em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>UK</strong></td>
<td>PS5 Digital Edition – £429.99<br>
<em>(No pricing changes for the standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive) </em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Australia</strong></td>
<td>Standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive – AUD $829.95<br>
PS5 Digital Edition – AUD $749.95</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>New Zealand&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>Standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive – NZD $949.95<br>
PS5 Digital Edition – NZD $859.95</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That’s a €50 price increase in Europe and £40 in the UK, when compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">the PS5 Slim’s launch back in 2023</a> – the console maintained the RRP from the late 2022 price hikes at that time.</p>
<p>Sony notes that there is “a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” as justification for making the price increases. It’s worth stating that it’s very unlikely that any of this is down to the recently imposed Trump tariffs in the US. That has sent shockwaves of uncertainty through markets, but making pricing adjustments outside of tariffs-related changes in the US will likely have been a longer term decision from Sony.</p>
<p>Or perhaps Sony wasn’t wanting to be left out of the “Switch 2 is too expensive” conversation and decided to get themselves a piece of the action</p>


<p>As a counterweight, the standalone Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive is getting cheaper, with price cuts of €50 and £30 respectively. That will still make buying a disc drive PS5 most cost effective in the EU and UK – €30 / £20 better value, respectively – but is mainly a boon to PS5 Pro buyers who might want to grab an optical drive.</p>
<p>Here’s the new PS5 optical drive pricing.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Europe</strong></td>
<td>€79.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>UK</strong></td>
<td>&nbsp;£69.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Australia</strong></td>
<td>AUD $124.95</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>New Zealand&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>NZD $139.95</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

            <p>
Sony has raised the price of PS5 once again, with increases in the UK, mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 Digital Edition will now cost £40 or €50 more, and will sell for £430/€500, up from £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
The price hike was announced in the early hours of this morning, via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">blog post</a> in which Sony blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".
</p>
<p>
No price rises have been announced for the PS5's disc edition or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in the UK or mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>In Australia and New Zealand, the price of both the PS5 Digital Edition and PS5 with a disc drive will increase, to AU $750 or NZ $860, and AU $830 or $950 respectively.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-price-increase-announced-by-30-in-uk">Sony last raised the PS5's price here in Europe back in August 2022</a>, when it hiked the Digital Edition by £30 or €50, from £360/€400 to £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
This second round of price rises mean the PS5 Digital Edition is now, in pure monetary terms, £70 or €100 more expensive than when it originally went on sale. 
</p>
<p>
But as Sony taketh, so it giveth at least something back. If you did still want a Disc Drive add-on, this has been slightly cut in price - down to £70/€80. Maybe there's plenty of those still lying around the warehouse.
</p>
<p>At £430, the PS5 Digital Edition is the same price as Nintendo's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World</a>. Equally notable: Argos is still offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3L4e">PS5 Astro Bot bundle</a>, including a disc drive, at £430 as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, over at EE, the <a href="https://tidd.ly/4ibW8XK">PS5 Digital Edition with Astro Bot is still going for £329</a>, a full £100 less than the Sony’s looming price rise for the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After that, it gives you a step-by-step guide that helps you learn the ropes. You’ll find guidance for what to do on your first day, how to eat, mine, and equip yourself with new tools and armor. Then it goes into day two and beyond. This is a great starting point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also check out IGNs full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft">Minecraft guide</a> for a lot of this same info.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Minecraft: Guide Collection</h2><div id="154292" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Minecraft: Guide Collection</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/57Alx?object_uuid=0d1db9ea-ca55-4cce-b640-855f2f21cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it on Amazon</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for a book (or set of books) that covers the basics of Minecraft in a good deal of detail, the Guide Collection is hard to beat. This collection has everything you need to know to move from a novice Minecrafter to an experienced one. While this line of guides does expand further than this box set of four titles, these are the most helpful books for pretty much anyone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It includes guides to Exploration, Creative, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Redstone_Guide">Redstone</a>, and the Nether &amp; the End.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rusty-rabbit-review-few-screws-loose<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're into anime, light novels, or visual novels, Gen Urobuchi's influence is everywhere. He's the mind behind some of anime's biggest hits, including <em>Madoka Magica</em>, <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, and <em>Fate Zero</em>. That's just a fraction of his work, and his status as a legend is hard to dispute. So when I saw he was involved in creating <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, you can imagine my excitement.</p>

<p>Part side-scrolling adventure/platformer, part visual novel, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a charming game on the surface, no doubt. As a fan of Urobuchi's work, though, you can imagine my disappointment when <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s narrative, and in some cases its gameplay, didn't quite live up to my admittedly lofty expectations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-priest.jpg?itok=K8yXAVe1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-priest.jpg?itok=r6w-wqnO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That money's probably going into giving this rabbit some insane bling.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Different Approach for the Urobutcher</h2>

<p>Urobuchi is often called the "Urobutcher" for his unrelenting and brutal attitude towards characters in his narratives. It's apparent right from the start that <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a departure from these norms, and that's perfectly fine. A more lighthearted story as opposed to a violent one is a nice change of pace for Urobuchi.</p>

<p><em>Rusty Rabbit</em> stars the eponymous Rusty, and he's an ol' rabbit with that boomer mindset that's probably all too familiar to some of us with aging parents. He's stuck in his ways, gruff, and says it how it is. He's a scrapper by trade and digs for junk in Smokestack Mountain, and that's how he makes his living in this frozen wasteland of a world.</p>

<p>True to developer NITRO PLUS' usual portfolio, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s narrative is often loaded with pages of exposition. The main story of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> doesn't bog players down with a ton of story, but for those who want to explore its worldbuilding, lore, and Rusty's character, you have <em>plenty</em> of dialogue to comb through.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-renovation.jpg?itok=HPJKiagR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-renovation.jpg?itok=oZAr_wU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that is how lights work.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't mind reading pages of dialogue -- I'm a budding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan" rel="nofollow">visual novel fan</a>, after all -- but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s additional lore is padded with a lot of unnecessary or uninteresting writing. This is not&nbsp;Urobuchi's best work by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>For instance, you can take on various repair projects as you collect parts throughout your scrapping adventures -- a pair of tires, a car frame, stuff like that. You'll be met with, sometimes, a couple of dozen pages of Rusty talking about tires, and it seems like he's just talking in circles. Look, unless you're a mechanic, you're probably not going to find these projects as exciting as Rusty does.</p>

<p>In these sequences, there are some tidbits of lore that dive into Rusty's complicated past involving his wife and daughter. It's unfortunate that most of Rusty's development is hidden in pages of dialogue that are simply boring to read.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-bbs.jpg?itok=KtT6ymB1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-bbs.jpg?itok=3msXaSrK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not like these folks'll matter much, in the end.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's Up With the BBs in <em>Rusty Rabbit?</em></h2>

<p>The narrative also makes a point to shoehorn in a group of characters that, in the end, serve little to no purpose. <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> gasses up this group of junksters, called the BBs, as a group of rabbits exploring Smokestack Mountain for uncertain reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll come across the BBs plenty of times throughout the narrative, but maybe one out of the six gets a modicum of character development. The rest are simply there for gags, or to give Rusty blueprints or items he needs to proceed through levels. It's a shame because Urobuchi has the ability to craft great characters, but that is not apparent in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>.</p>

<p>The worldbuilding holds some promise, at least. As the truth of the world becomes more apparent as you progress, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> sprinkles tidbits of information throughout and keeps you guessing and theorizing. I enjoy settings that are mysterious in nature, but it's held back by the lack of character development and too much dialogue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-drilling.jpg?itok=mW0PasxC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-drilling.jpg?itok=G0hhjo-v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It IS satisfying to clear out all those blocks.</figcaption></figure><h2>It's a Junkers Life 'fer Me</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a game about digging for junk. Levels are 2.5D environments filled with drillable blocks, hazards, and enemies called rust beasts. Your main goal is to progress through each level and hit certain points in the story to progress. It's nothing too crazy, but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s simplicity means it can be an enjoyable time.</p>

<p>The core of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> has remained the same since Urobuchi conceived <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lore-behind-rusty-rabbit-is-absolutely-nuts" rel="nofollow">the idea</a> during COVID-19 lockdown: digging for junk in large, sprawling levels. It's in these levels that there is both a great deal of promise but also untapped potential.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-blocks-2.jpg?itok=jRo2MWJS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-blocks-2.jpg?itok=TYq8jU-O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking out a bunch of blocks in one go, it's cathartic!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s first half is almost painfully basic. These first several areas in Smokestack Mountain appear Metroidvania-esque on the surface, but are mostly just linear pathways that wind around to give the feeling of being maze-like. <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> doesn't hit its stride until later, when new ideas are incorporated to make levels more dynamic.</p>

<p>Exploration and finding new upgrades to progress through levels takes more of a role later on, which is great -- racking your brain over where to go next and finding new areas to explore in games such as this are engaging. As a result, though, the first half is underbaked and relatively unexciting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-combat.jpg?itok=s1PhBBUv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-combat.jpg?itok=dmP8DpPX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun to the face will always do a rust beast in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools of the Trade in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em></h2>

<p>Rusty's mech, Junkster, is your means of transportation, and it's quite a handy vehicle, at that. Moving in Junkster feels great. Movement is responsive, and platforming is a cinch. Most failures in making a jump feel like my fault rather than the game's -- though, sometimes there are collision issues, which will no doubt be ironed out in a patch or two.</p>

<p>You're equipped with four different types of weapons: a drill, shotgun, blade, and hammer. These are all used for different purposes, like clearing specific obstacles or doing extra damage to certain enemy types; again, it's simple, and these all do what they need to do. Sometimes, simple is best.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-map.jpg?itok=OvbTntmx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-map.jpg?itok=VZQUg_8g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More tools means you might be able to access areas once inaccessible.</figcaption></figure><p>You also unlock various traversal options, like a higher jump and a wire that grabs onto ledges and such. Using the full suite of tools at your disposal opens up a lot of possibilities and allows NITRO PLUS to create more complex environments. Having the fully upgraded Junkster -- with its weapons and traversal options -- greatly increased my enjoyment of the gameplay.</p>

<p>There are a few other gameplay systems players can engage with, like a leveling system that grants skill points for upgrades. Upgrades are useful and necessary, so gaining XP from killing enemies and drilling blocks has its advantages. There's a town where you're able to buy various items to aid you in combat or in crafting, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-crafting_0.jpg?itok=JY2iqRE4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-crafting_0.jpg?itok=WQWcAFHC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to craft better weapons as time goes on.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's a Scrapper Without Crafting?</h2>

<p>But crafting is where <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> once again leads to some disappointment. As a scrapper, it's part of Rusty's character to salvage junk and turn it into useful items. These items usually come in the form of new weapons, which are, in some cases, needed to progress the story.</p>

<p>Crafting new weapons requires parts, and you'll only gain parts by drilling through certain blocks. There's also an endless dungeon where you can essentially farm for more parts to craft said weapons, but I never felt compelled to engage with this content much.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-shops.jpg?itok=K62ifnaU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-shops.jpg?itok=Z2ypCzxZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy or sell scrap.</figcaption></figure><p>More powerful weapons are required to explore some secret areas in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, but the story doesn't usually require you to go out of your way for these. So the Endless Dungeon feels nothing more than a vessel for getting parts for weapons that you don't necessarily need, unless you're trying to be a completionist.</p>

<p>Weapons also come with various modifiers that are RNG-dependent, which feels pointless. These modifiers don't seem to matter much at the end of the day, but supposing some players are looking for one modifier or another, I suppose that could be quite frustrating to just <em>not</em> get what you want and having to farm more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-boomer.jpg?itok=lV727VRR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-boomer.jpg?itok=WabSyHos 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I know someone just like this.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Rusty Rabbit</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's worth mentioning, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s a pretty little game. The rabbits are so fluffy and distinct in their designs, but that leads to further disappointment when you find they have no personality outside of eye-catching designs. On top of that, environments are very cool -- NITRO PLUS makes a point to create visually distinct areas, and it does a lot to break up any sort of repetition.</p>

<p>There are definitely some issues with <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, though, both in a narrative sense and in its gameplay, but it is still a perfectly adequate title. With its <em>mostly</em> smooth movement and platforming, as well as the therapeutic nature of drilling through blocks, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> can still be an enjoyable little romp. It's just a game that, sadly, never achieves its full potential.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone skyrocketed in popularity in the last couple of weeks, thanks to the return of Verdansk. It was a grand reintroduction of the map, and millions of fans poured back into the battle royale title to see what – if anything – had changed from the last time it was in the game, in 2021.</p>



<p>Corsair is the latest tech manufacturer to unveil a Call of Duty-themed range to celebrate the return of Verdansk. The team uncovered a small but mighty range of products that includes a <strong>single keyboard keycap worth $79</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re the ultimate Warzone fan, you’ll want to secure one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-are-we-dropping">Where Are We Dropping</h2>



<p>Corsair’s brands have colluded to bring Warzone fans worldwide <a href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/s/call-of-duty#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a range of exclusive items</a>, including an on-theme Scuf controller, patterned DRAM, and a custom keyboard <strong>with </strong>a collectible keycap worth $79.</p>



<p>That’s right – it’s <strong>a single keycap for your keyboard, </strong>and it has a price tag of $79.</p>



<p>The keyboard comes from Drop, and it’s dubbed the CSTM80, a tenkeyless design with a nice camoflague detail around some of the keys. If you want to flex your Warzone fandom, you can purchase the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-artisan-keycap-call-of-duty-warzone-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Drop Artisan keycap</a> that features a miniaturised rendition of the Verdansk Stadium encased in smooth resin.</p>

<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival has just been revealed on Steam, but it has no release date. It’s an open-world, multiplayer survival game that two people in Japan have pieced together, and it looks pretty ambitious. In DMZ: Nuclear Survival, you’ll be charged with building an army and crafting bases while exploring an enormous map and messing around with history.</p>



<p>There’s one heck of a story behind DMZ: Nuclear Survival, but there are enough bizarre elements thrown into the mix to make me question the game’s validity.</p>



<p>For example, you can befriend and fight alongside bears, wolves, and <strong>ostriches</strong>. Interesting.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-use-of-the-past">Make Use of the Past</h2>



<p>The core premise of DMZ: Nuclear Survival is that the world has changed thanks to nuclear war, and the planet’s tectonic plates have shifted to form Pangea (again), a super-continent. For some reason, this has made it so that ancient ruins, ‘such as pyramids, terracotta warriors, and Roman temples’ are much easier to excavate.</p>



<p>Not only that, but players can pull relics and valuables from these locations across a procedurally generated map and use them to ‘resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes’.</p>



<p>That means alongside your strangely WWI- and WWII-themed private military contractors, you can have Roman soldiers and ‘Eastern martial artists’ fight for you. And bears – don’t forget the bears.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival will reportedly launch with PvE <strong>and </strong>PvP modes, and dedicated servers will be able to support <strong>over 100 players</strong>. Also, this upcoming survival game will have an offline single-player mode, which is rare in this type of title.</p>



<p>With in-depth base-building mechanics, intense combat scenarios, untold exploration potential, and first-blush visuals that look pretty good, DMZ: Nuclear Survival is either going to be a hit with survival fans, or it’ll be some kind of weird rug-pull.</p>



<p>We’ve seen games like this emerge before with bold promises and nothing to really deliver.</p>

Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are standing on a hill with the Jackson settlement they’ll call home in the distance. Ellie, unconvinced by Joel’s story about raiders massacring the Firefly revolutionaries who were looking to make a cure for the cordyceps fungus, asks the smuggler to swear that everything he said is true. Joel hesitates and then says that he swears. However, rather than keeping the now-iconic hard cut to black on Ellie’s skeptical face as she says “okay,” season two shows her walking down the hill and leaving Joel in an uncomfortable silence. This unnecessary addition to a scene that was once perfect is a pretty concise encapsulation of the season’s biggest problems. But it’s hardly the most egregious example in this episode.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h952049"><a id=""></a><strong>Unfamiliar faces</strong></h2><p>The first “new” scene shows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a></span> standing with her friends and fellow ex-Fireflies over a few dozen makeshift graves. She tearfully watches the same giraffe pack that Joel and Ellie stood in awe of days prior, grazing through the remains of Salt Lake City. HBO hasn’t played coy with Abby’s role in the season like Naughty Dog did ahead of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, but I was surprised at how quickly the show just tells you up front about her intentions.</p><p>As Owen (Spencer Lord), Mel (Ariela Barer), Nora (Tati Gabrielle), and Manny (Danny Ramirez) all discuss what their next steps are, prioritizing their safety and survival above all else, Abby has other ideas. She wants to find Joel, and she wants to kill him “slowly” for what he’s done to the Fireflies. She puts a pendant around one of the crosses, implying some personal connection to one of Joel’s victims, before we cut to black. Already, <em>The Last of Us </em>struggles to elegantly add to <em>Part II</em>, seemingly in a misguided effort to add clarity to a story that has, historically, lent itself to several different interpretations. Withholding those reveals until later in the story was not just a narrative trick in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>that allowed it to twist the knife mid-game; it also helped generate a core tension foundational to the story being told. Two scenes in, <em>The Last of Us </em>is stripping away the tantalizing and uncomfortable mystique of the original story, but it doesn’t have anything to offer in its place. Dever commits to Abby’s rage and delivers the lines with conviction, and her friends’ hesitant compliance comes across well enough. There’s just a strange, stilted awkwardness to the actual script that the actors can’t shake.</p><p>Notably, most of the writing credits for <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season go to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://directories.wga.org/project/1235295/the-last-of-us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://directories.wga.org/project/1235295/the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Mazin</a></span>, one of the showrunners of the series, alongside series director Neil Druckmann. Druckmann and <em>Part II </em>narrative lead Halley Gross have writing credits on the final two episodes of the season, but the bulk of the seven-episode run has Mazin as the sole writing credit. I have to wonder how the writers’ room conversations went down when it came to rearranging these reveals for television and why the show tosses subtlety aside for a blunt, inelegant script in which people just say what they’re thinking to the camera. Abby was once a woman of few words, but Dever’s version tells the room what she’s feeling without a moment’s hesitation. This isn’t a problem exclusive to her in this show, but it was surprising that this tendency was put on such obvious display not once, but twice in the first five minutes.</p><figure id="" data-id="8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-recommend-id="image://8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-recommend-id="image://8a11cce02c7bc9d8dd22962d46dd930c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks teary-eyed over her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h952050"><a id=""></a><strong>A community worth fighting for</strong></h2><p>Suddenly, <em>The Last of Us </em>jumps forward five years, as <em>Part II </em>did before it. We find a tattooed Ellie sparring with a man twice her size and gaining the upper hand until he taps out. Ellie doesn’t let him out of her grip until Jesse (Young Mazino) snaps her out of her bloodlust. Jesse coaches her, and reveals that he told her sparring partner to pull his punches. Ellie takes offense to this, and it becomes a thread throughout the season that the men around her in Jackson are taking steps to shelter her from the violence she seems to crave.</p><p>I’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-ellie-bella-ramsey-violent-heart-1850224988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-ellie-bella-ramsey-violent-heart-1850224988">written at length</a></span> about how I don’t like the show’s portrayal of Ellie as a person who enjoys the act of violence rather than just someone who believes strongly in the meaning behind it, but season 2’s handling of this thread is so uneven that it’s impossible to unravel just in this first episode. Seeing her tendency toward violence portrayed as a reaction to her being overly sheltered and protected and simply wanting to prove herself is preferable to season one’s notion that she’s just an inherently sadistic person, but <em>The Last of Us </em>is unsure of where this inclination comes from, so we’ll be untangling this messy thread as we track Ellie’s violent spiral throughout the season.</p><p>As Ellie leaves the gym, we get a shot of the Jackson, Wyoming, settlement she and Joel have lived in for five years. It’s a pretty accurate recreation of <em>Part II</em>’s version of the small town, with citizens all working together to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Ellie doesn’t seem convinced by the arrangement, however. She scoffs at the notion of “community” and being part of something bigger than herself. Ellie certainly didn’t seem <em>happy</em> in Jackson in <em>Part II</em>, but again, the show doesn’t care for subtlety and instead has added a new layer of discontent to her arc this time around.</p><p>I hesitate to put this solely on Ramsey, given they are working with the material they’ve been given, but their more youthful performance of Ellie doesn’t work in the character’s favor. Yes, Ramsey is technically older than the 19-year-old Ellie, but where Ashley Johnson’s performance in the games gave Ellie the air of a dejected loner struggling to accept a life she wasn’t content with, Ramsey’s comes off as bratty and childlike. I have trouble buying their performance in even the most neutral of scenes, much less the weightier moments to come.</p><p>Pascal, meanwhile, is daddying his daddiest dad self as Joel, doing handyman shit while entertaining Dina (Isabela Merced), Ellie’s close friend in Jackson. While I think many of the show’s departures from the game are for the worse, I welcome this one. Dina and Joel have basically no interaction whatsoever in <em>Part II</em>, and having the two be close in the show gives both actors an opportunity to shine, and makes up for some of the structural changes the show makes that have condensed Pascal’s role a bit this season. This scene lets Joel be more than the violent smuggler he’s often viewed as, and lets us see him as just a gruff older man trying desperately to connect with the youth. Much of Joel’s legacy in <em>The Last of Us </em>is paved in violence, but when you get him in safe living conditions with more mundane problems like circuitry and teen angst, he’s the embodiment of an oblivious, well-meaning southern dad. “Girl, the war crimes.” I know, I know, but he’s also babygirl.</p><p>But even this nice moment of Joel throwing out some circuitry jargon (whatever you say, beautiful) is cut short by Dina asking what’s up with him and Ellie. Why are these two on the outs, and why does no one else seem to know why? Joel chalks it up to teen angst and rebellion against her father figure. Again, HBO’s <em>The Last of Us </em>loves to codify feelings and questions in the most overt way possible, and somehow, it dives straight into the debate about the surrogate nature of Joel and Ellie’s relationship that fans have been having for years in a way that is surprisingly much more explicit. Joel says he’s her parent, but in a later scene, Gail explicitly says he is not. “I figure it’s normal,” Joel says to Dina. “Her being 19 and me being her...what I am. No one likes their parents at that age. I never got there with my own kid, so we’re both just figuring it out for the first time, is all.”</p><p>Perhaps it’s just my preference for the game’s sparse exploration of these ideas that makes me raise my eyebrows at these changes. Many of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ script tweaks feel like they’re rooted in a need to course-correct public perception or acknowledge fan discourse. Joel and Ellie have what feels like a familial relationship, but so many online arguments regarding Joel’s actions against the Fireflies have been rooted in whether or not they were “actually” family. Does Joel have the right to save Ellie from a lethal surgery if he’s not “really” her father? Can you claim the seemingly almost genetic inclination Ellie has toward retribution comes from Joel if she’s not “actually” his daughter? These matters were never even in consideration for Joel and Ellie before, but suddenly, it’s a concern for this version of the characters after years of discourse made it one. In a vacuum, it’s fine. In the big picture of the franchise, it feels manufactured, like the writers deliberately inserting a community discourse into the minds of characters who never once cared about it.</p><p>Sure, maybe I’m comparing Pascal and Ramsey’s versions of these characters to the originals too much. Still, part of watching an adaptation is wondering what, if anything, is gained and lost in translation. <em>The Last of Us </em>is trapped so rigidly within the confines of the specific story the games tell that every deviation, for good and ill, bears more scrutiny. Compare it to something like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-season-2-finale-episode-flood-3-kai-master-chief-1851356937">the <em>Halo </em>series</a></span>, which tells an entirely different story, or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417">the new <em>Devil May Cry </em>anime</a></span> that reboots the whole continuity. It’s easier to just get on the ride and see what new riffs a team comes up with. The<em> Last of Us</em> show has been so tied up in faithfully recreating what Mazin believes is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030">“the greatest story ever told in video games”</a></span> to a new audience that every time there is a change in the way these characters talk to each other, I have to wonder what Mazin’s team thinks is gained in this expository approach. Am I wrong for thinking that if someone is mostly sticking to the old script but makes notable changes or additions, they think there’s something to be improved upon in the source material? Were those more restrained interactions something Mazin viewed as a weak point in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s storytelling, or is it a kneejerk reaction to the way people talk about it?<em> </em>&nbsp;</p><p>These problems aren’t inherently the medium of television’s fault, but the show certainly has different priorities than the games it’s based on. Whenever Joel, Ellie, Abby, or anyone else pulls subtext out of the ground like the cordyceps roots some workers find infesting the piping of Jackson, it feels oddly condescending, like someone at HBO thinks viewers wouldn’t be smart enough to pick up any of this on their own.</p><p>At any rate, Joel claims he’s not sure what he did to deserve Ellie’s ire, but he’s working on himself in the meantime by going to therapy. Ellie is doing some therapy of her own, sniping infected off Jackson’s border with Joel’s brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna). At the behest of his brother, Tommy has removed Ellie from the patrols that take out infected in the areas surrounding Jackson, and our funky little lesbian is less than thrilled. She’s the only person in the town who’s immune to the cordyceps infection, so in theory, Ellie should be fighting at the frontlines of the infection. But her immunity is a secret. Tommy shushes her when she brings it up, so she then starts shouting it to anyone in a one-mile radius. Again, a reaction that might’ve fit the spritely 14-year-old Ellie in season one but feels out of place for the more world-weary 19-year-old Ramsey is meant to be in this season.</p><figure id="" data-id="772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-recommend-id="image://772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Benji sits on Joel's lap." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Benji sits on Joel's lap." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-recommend-id="image://772916a62c79e8e74c2b12b9f774831d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Benji sits on Joel's lap." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Back in Jackson proper, Joel and his sister-in-law Maria (Rutina Wesley) are working on city planning as new refugees enter the enclosure. Maria’s painfully aware that despite her best efforts, Jackson can’t accommodate the number of people coming in looking for food and shelter. The town has buildings, restaurants, infrastructure, and even a governing body, but even the most coordinated mutual aid effort eventually rubs up against the reality of an apocalypse. Maria is idealistic. She believes that she owes it to those in need to help, but Joel says that if the lifeboat is swamped, you leave them outside.</p><p>“You’ve gotta look after your own first, or you’re no good to anyone,” he says casually. I’m sure this was his rationale when he murdered dozens of Fireflies to save Ellie, but Maria judges him from across the room. Then, in comes a brand new character for the show: Tommy and Maria’s son Benji. Joel puts him on his knee and shows him a town map, playfully talking about shooting the “monsters” beyond the wall. Maria’s stare softens, as she’s clearly moved by the sentiment when her child is in front of her. <em>The Last of Us </em>has always positioned family, found or otherwise, as something that shifts one’s perspective, whether toward selflessness or selfishness. So, I’m curious to see how the show wields Benji when it comes to Tommy and Maria’s actions in the future. However, even if she hears Joel, Maria leaves him with the thought that he was a refugee once, too, which he acknowledges with a knowing nod.</p><h2 id="h952051"><a id=""></a><strong>Working on yourself</strong></h2><p>Joel heads to therapy with Gail (Catherine O’Hara), another character made whole cloth for the show. The first season <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-tlou-hbo-joel-anxiety-meds-ellie-1850145039&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-tlou-hbo-joel-anxiety-meds-ellie-1850145039">made a big to-do about Joel’s anxiety</a></span> (another thing that was mostly just implied in the games), so giving him a therapy sideplot feels like the natural next step in the arc. The old man is visibly uncomfortable in Gail’s home. Initially, this comes off as him being unhappy to be doing some self-work, but it quickly becomes clear why he might feel some type of way in this house specifically. Gail offers him tea or whisky before their session starts, then partakes in the latter herself. It’s her birthday, the first without her husband Eugene in 41 years. Game fans will know Eugene as an ex-Firefly who died of old age shortly before the events of the game, but the show has taken some creative liberties with his history.</p><p>Gail reveals that Joel shot and killed her husband, and she hates him for it. Surely it must be more complicated than that if he’s sitting in her home right now. All we know is that Joel “had no choice” and that Gail’s issue is less that Joel murdered Eugene than it is his methods. She expresses all this resentment as a means to pull the same kind of raw honesty out of Joel, who she suspects is holding back in their sessions. Probing into the obvious divide between him and Ellie, Gail asks Joel if he hurt her, to which he tearfully shakes his head. Then he stands up and simply says, “I saved her,” before walking out. Stubborn and sure of himself as ever.</p><p>Of all <em>The Last of Us</em>’ new additions, I probably feel most conflicted about Gail. O’Hara is a charismatic delight as always, and having someone who isn’t scared to call out Joel Miller is a refreshing dynamic. But when the show’s biggest writing problem is a tendency toward unnaturally expositional dialogue that sounds like it’s coming from a YouTube explainer, having a character whose role is to make people talk about their feelings could easily exacerbate the issue. There’s a danger that, rather than Joel and Ellie simply having a traumatic experience, they’ll have to explain it to Gail like a book report, analyzing their lives like a text. Joel’s vague confession here isn’t that overt, but after seeing some of the earlier scenes in the episode, Gail’s presence already makes me wary.</p><figure id="" data-id="932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-recommend-id="image://932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel stands over Gail in her living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel stands over Gail in her living room." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-recommend-id="image://932643f453a64a34cb27601ee7391dc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel stands over Gail in her living room." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h952052"><a id=""></a><strong>A first date to die for</strong></h2><p>We then shift over to Ellie’s home, a furnished garage in Joel’s backyard. The space is a nearly perfect recreation of her little hut in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, complete with <em>Savage Starlight </em>posters, retro music tapes, and the tobacco sunburst acoustic guitar with the moth decal on the fretboard. I’ve always loved Ellie’s tiny corner of Jackson because it says so much about her, both in the game and the show. Covered in nerdy paraphernalia from a time she can only dream about, Ellie’s room is a nostalgic time capsule for a life she never got to live. Most of the collectibles and swag she’s gathered over the years are here because she managed to stumble upon them in her and Joel’s journey. Her collection of comics and music was salvaged like any bandage or shiv taped together to help them survive. I don’t doubt that she loves the intergalactic adventures of Dr. Daniela Star, but I also find her attachment to one particular comic fascinating because I wonder if the tastes of kids in this world develop organically or if it’s just about whatever they find when rummaging in dusty drawers and shelves. Ellie’s room is built like a scrapbook, things chosen from whatever she finds lying around, to which she imparts special significance.</p><p>That is all much more apparent in the game, as the show doesn’t linger in Ellie’s home for very long. We do get a cool shot of her doing some gun maintenance, which feels like an homage to <em>Part II</em>’s elaborate gun modification animations whenever you upgrade your gear. Then the camera lingers on Ellie’s tattoo, which covers up a chemical burn where her bite mark used to be, but more on that later. Dina shows up and helps Ellie get ready for their patrol before fishing for more info on her and Joel’s little spat. Ellie doesn’t take the bait, though Dina doesn’t strike me as someone to give up that easily.</p><p>The pair collect their horses, including Shimmer, the MVP of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>(if you know, you know), and meet up with Jesse for patrol assignments. There’s palpable tension between the girls and Jesse, who comes off less like a protective older brother to Ellie and more like a jilted, condescending one. Not that those things are mutually exclusive, and perhaps it works better this way considering Ellie’s more young and reckless inclinations in this version of the story. Jesse is a leader in this community, and when you have someone who seems to be jaded toward the very notions of community and responsibility, perhaps it makes more sense for the two of them to be at odds.</p><p>Joining Ellie and Dina on this horse ride is Kat, another character who is only mentioned in Ellie’s diary entries in <em>Part II</em> as her first girlfriend in Jackson. That history remains true in the show, with Dina playfully telling Ellie she should take Kat to the town’s New Year’s dance. She’s “the other one” in Jackson, meaning that yeah, the queer community in this settlement is pretty small, and there seems to be some taboo around it. We’ll unpack this more as the season goes on, but I do feel for Ellie in this moment, being essentially paired off with the one other young lesbian in town just because there’s no one else. Every queer person has a story of a well-meaning friend telling you they have someone they think you should meet and it just happens to be the only other gay person in their orbit. It probably feels even worse when the person saying this to you is a friend you’re obviously crushing on. Dina catches on that Ellie’s got the hots for someone else and offers to go with her as friends, revealing that she and Jesse have broken up (again, for now). Shoot your shot, Ellie.</p><p>The patrol then stumbles upon a gnarly crime-scene-like spectacle of infected corpses strewn around outside an abandoned supermarket, but hey, you should see the other guy. A bear’s remains are at the center of all the carnage, and its guts are hanging out of its body. The grisly (sorry) sight doesn’t deter the two lovebirds as they head into the old grocery store to take out whatever infected stragglers may be lurking within. Despite their flirtatious unseriousness, Dina and Ellie are more than capable of fucking up a group of infected. Merced and Ramsey are fun together as they joke around even in dire circumstances. The actual fight scene between the two and the infected stragglers is full of some cute nods to the games, like Ellie using a glass bottle to distract one of the beasts and then jumping on its back and frantically stabbing it, similar to her stealthy finishing move from <em>Part I</em>. Which, again, also illustrates that Ramsey sure doesn’t feel like the older Ellie of <em>Part II</em>. But it is what it is.</p><p>After taking out one clicker, Ellie falls through the floor to a lower level, and while she thinks she’s alone, it’s only because the infected down here is smart enough to hide. These stalkers are another kind of infected alongside the runners and clickers everyone’s used to. They can sneak, hide, and strategize in a way most infected can’t. Seeing the stalker successfully outsmart and outrun Ellie is pretty terrifying. Bill once said in <em>Part I</em> that infected were easy to deal with because they were predictable, and now Ellie’s finding out that might not be true any longer.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a46e0b925c0d982456169f13f297615" data-recommend-id="image://2a46e0b925c0d982456169f13f297615" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina report back to Jackson's council.

Speaking of difficult things, Ellie does have to explain this new infected to Tommy, Maria, and the rest of a Jackson council. Scene for scene, the <em>Last of Us</em> show spends more time in Jackson than <em>Part II</em> does, so it makes sense that HBO would take this opportunity to delve into the inner workings of how the settlement operates. We knew Maria calls the shots, but it’s nice to know big decisions are made by a committee. There are some hints of division, though, with some suspecting the cluster of infected found in and around the grocery store could indicate a larger infected horde on its way, while others remain skeptical.</p><p>We then get a scene that delves into part of Ellie’s life I hadn’t considered before, and is one of the more interesting moments in the episode that were created just for the show. In order to keep her immunity secret, Ellie has to cut herself further to make the bite mark less apparent, then stitching it like any other wound. She doesn’t go to a medical professional, instead sanitizing her switchblade and making do. Given that the show has changed how the infection works to no longer be airborne, I was curious how season two would handle illustrating Ellie’s immunity, and how she maintains the lie was an interesting bit of specificity that answered a question I hadn’t previously thought about.</p><h2 id="h952053"><a id=""></a><strong>Bridges burned</strong></h2><p>After she cleans the wound, Ellie starts jotting down notes about her day in her diary, another nice homage to <em>Part II</em> in which Ellie periodically writes her innermost thoughts in an old notebook the player can flip through. It’s the closest thing Ellie has to an internal monologue throughout the game, and it was certainly a better way of getting insight into her thought process than the more expository dialogue of the show. Those little glimpses into Ellie’s mind felt like they were written for her, and we just got a chance to read them and maybe gain some greater understanding of the violent conquest we were on. Meanwhile, the show’s dialogue in which Ellie expresses those feelings to someone else feels written for an assumed audience. Sure, all dialogue is written with an assumed audience, but masking that is not the show’s forte.</p><p>Joel shows up and asks if Ellie’s heading to the dance tonight, and it’s clear there’s tension between the two of them that neither wants to acknowledge outright. Joel does what he does best and insists on doing something for her despite her protests, pointing out that her guitar’s strings need changing and leaving with it.</p><figure id="" data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-recommend-id="image://59fbc26bcc3dfc9d3c8cc58e8332dfb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we see one of the best scenes in all of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>: the dance, a sequence so good in the game that I was really glad to see the writers largely left it alone here. Dina dancing to Crooked Still’s “Little Sadie,” Ellie being a wallflower on the sidelines, and then the extroverted friend rushing to the introverted one and pulling her onto the dancefloor. The exchange between the two as Crooked Still’s “Ecstacy” plays in the background is still one of my favorites in the series. Every line is meticulously thought out, illustrating Ellie’s insecurity and Dina’s flirtatious confidence, and watching those two feelings collide in a kiss is downright electric. God, what a perfect fucking scene, right down to the moment when Seth (Robert John Burke), the town bigot, interrupts to throw a slur onto the dance floor in front of dozens of people. But in comes Ally of the Year Joel to knock him on his ass. Ellie lashes out and tells Joel she doesn’t want his help, so he leaves with his tail between his legs. Ellie is regretful but also clearly embarrassed by the scene that Seth and Joel just made.</p><p>As she heads back home, she sees Joel on his back porch, playing the restrung guitar. They lock eyes briefly before Ellie walks past him without stopping. Game fans know that scene goes down a bit differently, and I was genuinely shocked not only to see Joel sitting on that porch in the first episode but also to see Ellie walking past him without a word. By this point, I wasn’t sure what to make of this; the conversation that Joel and Ellie have on that porch is foundational to the story of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so when I saw this deviation in “Future Days,” I was more intrigued by it than anything else in the episode because I wondered how HBO’s adaptation would make up for not including it. But that’s a question for another episode, I suppose.</p><p>For now, we end “Future Days” with the citizens of Jackson in danger, both from inside and outside the settlement. The Cordyceps fungus is spreading in the pipes, and Abby and Owen are shown just outside the town’s border. It looks like this quiet, small-town refuge is about to become a battleground.</p><hr><p><em>The Last of Us </em>airs on Max, Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 system has been increased in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia due to a challenging economic environment.</p>
<p>With a rather unusual and somewhat suspect very early Monday announcement for the affected territories, SIE has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition has been increased to €499.99 in Europe, £429.99 in the United Kingdom, AUD $829.95 in Australia and NZD $949.95 in New Zealand as of today, April 14th. The price of the console's regular edition is unaffected, as is the price of the PlayStation 5 Pro. The price increase, according to Vice President of Global Marketing Isabelle Tomatis, has been caused by a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates, although, given the timing, the tariff situation between the United States and China is likely one of the factors that made SIE increase the console's price.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Disc Drive is also getting its price revised, although downwards. Starting today, April 14th, the Drive will be priced at €79.99 in Europe, £69.99 in the UK, AUD $124.95 in Australia, and NZD $139.95.</p>
<p>Price hikes are nothing new for the PlayStation 5, as the system's price was already increased in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">2022</a> in Europe,&nbsp;<span>the UK, and Australia, among other territories, before being increased again<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;last August</a> in Japan by around $90. With the current economic situation likely to continue being </span>challenging for a good while, it's possible that the system may see a price increase in other markets as well.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that it is going to increase the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The announcement came via a PlayStation Blog post on Sunday evening.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Starting April 14</a>, the cost of the PS5 Digital Edition in all affected regions and PS5 Physical Edition in both Australia and New Zealand will see an increase. Sony says that the price increase is a “tough decision” due to a “challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates”.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-titanfall-3-rumors-return-and-what-is-xbox-planning-to-show-fans-this-year">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-titanfall-3-rumors-return-and-what-is-xbox-planning-to-show-fans-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titanfall 3 Rumors Return And What Is Xbox Planning To Show Fans This Year?</a></h6>



<p>The new PS5 prices in the four regions are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Europe:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>PS5 Digital Edition €499.99&nbsp;(Physical remains the same)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>£429.99&nbsp;(Physical remains the same)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Australia:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard (Physical) Edition – AUD $829.95</li>



<li>PS5 Digital Edition – AUD $749.95</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>PS5 Standard (Physical) Edition – NZD $949.95 </li>



<li>PS5 Digital Edition – NZD $859.95</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The cost of the PS5 Pro will remain the same. And Sony is also lowering the price of the PS5 Disc Drive slightly. </p>



<p>Those new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Europe:&nbsp;</strong>€79.99</li>



<li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;£69.99&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Australia:</strong>&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>



<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong>&nbsp;NZD $139.95</li>
</ul>



<p>As of publishing, it’s unclear if Sony plans to increase the price of the PS5 in other regions such as the United States and Canada. Currently, the United States’ planned tariffs are on hold for 90 days. Should they be reintroduced, it could continue to upend the same market that led Nintendo to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned countries</a>.</p>

That rule is now clearly dead in the water.</p><p>Sony's PlayStation 5 launched in Australia for AUD$750 (for the disc drive version) back in 2020. That was a lot of money at the time, but it was a new console, whatever, lots of folks probably figured if they waited a few years they'd be able to snag one for less.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-bongo-cat-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bongo Cat was released on Steam on March 5, and in the time it has been online, it has racked up a review rating of <strong>Overwhelmingly Positive</strong>. As I write this, 130,000 people are playing the game on Steam, but <strong>what even is it</strong>? The game’s description on Steam doesn’t give anything away, leaving many to wonder what Bongo Cat is and why it is going insane on Steam.</p>



<p>Here’s the description, which will make more sense once you’ve read through the explanation below:</p>



<p><em>‘Bongo cat needs your help. Bongo cat needz more hatz!!! Every time you press a key, Bongo Cat will punch your taskbar. Type, click, play, and work to collect more points. Which hats will you find?’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-hatz">More Hatz</h2>



<p>If you remember the banana-themed game on Steam that was aptly named <strong>Banana</strong>, then you’ll understand some of the premise for Bongo Cat.</p>



<p>In Banana, players were presented with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a banana that they clicked on</a>. The more they clicked, the more banana skins (get it?) they earned, and the kicker was that they could take those skins and trade them on the Steam Marketplace. That’s how Banana managed to skyrocket to a peak concurrent player count of more than 900,000 Steam users.</p>



<p>What is Bongo Cat? Think of it as being <strong>Banana</strong>, but replace the fruit with a cat, and instead of doing nothing when you click on it, the cat slaps your taskbar. It sits over whatever you’re doing, and everything you do will earn another slap – clicking, typing, and so on. As you rack up points, you’ll earn new cats, hats, and other items, such as emotes and floating icons.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-bongo-cat">What’s the Point of Bongo Cat?</h2>



<p>It’s not enough to know what Bongo Cat is, you must also understand <strong>what the point of the game is</strong>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t really have much of a point, but the game’s <strong>feature list </strong>on Steam mentions that it will be ‘A friend while working hard.’</p>



<p>As you collect points, you can unlock items that range from Common to Legendary, and when you get them, you’re free to trade and sell them within the Steam Marketplace. </p>



<p>And now you understand why Bongo Cat is soaring in popularity – it’s because there’s a slight chance of making some money on the game.</p>



<p>If you want to give Bongo Cat a try, you get get it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for free now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-q-a.1163298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-gdc-2025-hands-on-and-developer-qa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>TiMi Studio’s signature multiplayer title may not as well known as other MOBA contemporaries outside the Asian market, but Honor of Kings remains one of the most-played titles in the genre. In mainland China, Honor of Kings will be celebrating its tenth anniversary later this year, while the global/Western release only debuted last year. This Multiplayer Online Battle Arena is branching out into new genres for the first time with a (not so massive) multiplayer online RPG titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-resurfaces-with-gorgeous-gdc-2025-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor of Kings: World</a> due out sometime later this year. With a new genre comes a new potential to reach a target audience that might have otherwise overlooked this Chinese epic.</p>
<p>At GDC 2025, Tencent allowed me to jump into a pair of missions and experience a bit of the story, with the implication that this was still fairly early on in the adventure as the main character was still getting a grasp of his powers. Rather than picking a single weapon type and sticking with it, Honor of Kings: World lets players pick a pair of classes from a wide range of melee, spellcasters, and ranged combatants. Each of the different classes holds a similar breadth of skills to one another, from three standard attacks unique to that class, a dodge or evasive ability, and some form of ultimate attack. There’s clearly the potential to mix and match some powerful combinations with class attacks, usually conferring some sort of elemental attack and either a positive buff for the player or a negative debuff for any poor fodder enemies in their path.</p>
<p>In a character action game, the melee combat remains the standard to judge first and foremost, and I’m pleased with how Honor of Kings World makes each weapon feel dynamically different. It’s actually the ranged combat that drew me in and made my experience for this brief hour memorable. One of the eleven classes gave my hero character a massive gun, complete with an active reload mechanic and more than enough supporting fire to never stop firing on the enemy. Large swords are undeniably cool, but pulling off solid ranged combat in a character action game will always capture my heart.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World showed off only a small slice of the levels, from a couple of encounters that went straight into boss fights to a moderately lengthy dungeon filled with side paths containing loot and a couple of environmental puzzles. Admittedly, one of the puzzles stumped me because I was thrown into a dungeon without having done a tutorial that would teach me that ice grenades can freeze movable blocks in place. I can’t fault the developers for having to point me in the right direction when I solved two-thirds of a puzzle for a hidden treasure chest but couldn’t finish the final piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>It may not have been on my radar before GDC 2025, but I would absolutely check out Honor of Kings: World again sometime later this year. While no PlayStation release is a bit of a bummer, the UI and bite-sized missions would be perfect on the go for mobile gamers. After the hands-on, I chatted a bit with Simon, the lead designer for&nbsp;this project.</p>
<p><iframe title="GDC 2025 Announcement Trailer | Honor of Kings: World" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oFTbOeyFUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about Honor of Kings: World for newcomers.</strong></p>
<p>We are a next-generation multiplayer adventure RPG. We started from the original IP and we are ready to take it to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the IP's DNA is there in Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's in everything because of the way we started this project. We took the core concept, like the combat, but then we elevated it. As you can see, every combat style you play is actually a champion from the game, and we actually turned it into a three-dimensional action experience. Also, the story and the world are from the MOBA.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the champions from Honor of Kings will be playable in this new game?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, I hope all of them, but we are starting with the first champions from the first region because we don't want players to have this feeling like there are hundreds of champions. So, the way we do it is that we introduce a region and the champions who are related to the region and the story. We introduce players to them, and through the updates, we will add more and more and more champions.</p>
<p><strong>Since players are controlling two separate champions, how do you go about balancing the synergy?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the player is the protagonist. This protagonist has the power to master the flow of the others, so he's learning abilities from the champions. That's the whole concept. We also try to provide you with the fun of this dramatic difference from each combat style, but we still try to keep it at the same level.</p>
<p>If you play the game like a single player experience, I think the difference is the fun part of it. For example, when you select the character with a gun, the shooting and dodging are emphasized a lot. It's a different kind of experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to the multiplayer, you have a little bit of positioning. If you're into counterattacks, you're supposed to engage with the boss constantly. But if you're a ranger, you're supposed to be providing the damage. Then you have something like a support character role, but we want everything, every class in the multiplayer also to be able to fight back, not just like standing there and healing.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel that Honor of Kings World is trying to do away with the holy trinity of tank, damage dealer, and healer?</strong></p>
<p>We are not going fully exactly on that. The baseline is still that, even if you're a support character, you are meant to have a great action experience. Since you can access two classes, you can actually switch between support and DPS. I mean, if you really want to go for a full support role, you can do that. But normally, you can switch to another style and get into DPS mode, depending on the occasion of the combat.</p>
<p><strong>Can Honor of Kings: World be played entirely solo?</strong></p>
<p>You can if you want. We actually provide quite a lot of a single player experience. It's an option. We provide a non-invasive multiplayer experience for you. At some point, it's always convenient to play with others. Let's say that you feel like a boss fight is too difficult. As a player, you can always call for help,&nbsp;but it's not going to be disruptive.</p>
<p><strong>Can you bring in AI companions?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's like an assistant function. If you can't find a friend or you just want to play alone, then there are options for AI companions in the dungeons or stuff like that. So it's more like an accessible assistant function to that.</p>
<p><strong>How's the matchmaking? Can you select, like, I want to play this specific mission and the game tries to match you with other players?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's very straightforward. When you are going to a dungeon, then if you want a team, you can just match with players who are similar to your rank.</p>
<p><strong>At launch, how will players have access to the characters? Will they have access to the whole initial roster? Will they just have access to one or two?</strong></p>
<p>I think we provide several in the storyline, like a basic set. It's actually still quite a few. The way actually way you progress in the story, you get to meet the champions and get familiar with them, and then you learn their abilities. You will have a basic combo set along the way, and it's tailor-made for you to understand the system. Then later on, if you want more, you would just go for purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about the business model for Honor of Kings: World yet?</strong></p>
<p>What I can tell you is that we are building monetization around social, so it's going to be around outfits and skins, nothing that is pay-to-win.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know roughly how much buying an additional champion would cost?</strong></p>
<p>We're still working on that.</p>
<p><strong>Are there already any plans for a premium or battle pass?</strong></p>
<p>I think that's very possible in the future. Since monetization is at an early stage of testing right now, we don't have a detailed fixed rule on that, but I think something like that is very likely.</p>
<p><strong>Will Honor of Kings: World be free to play, or do players have to make an initial purchase to play?</strong></p>
<p>No, it's a free-to-play game, so&nbsp;no purchase at all.</p>
<p><strong>Which platforms are you launching on?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are focusing on PC and mobile. Hopefully, consoles will be in the future too, but right now, we're focusing on the first two.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a cross-progression between PC and mobile platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Mobile is more like an accessible way for you to play anytime, but it's as if it were the same platform.</p>
<p><strong>Will you have controller support?</strong></p>
<p>Not right now, but we can tell it's really important here, and so I think we will probably have that in the future plans.</p>
<p><strong>Especially for mobile, not everyone prefers playing lengthy RPGs with just the touchscreen.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think it's quite important, but right now, we are trying to polish the native mobile experience first.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any crossover events or content planned between Honor of Kings and Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>We're talking about it since we are the same IP and the same team. We are gradually talking about how do we actually - I mean, the narrative is already kind of merging together. We are at an early phase of the discussions right now.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of release window do you have in mind for Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a specific date. What I can tell you is that we are working really hard to bring it online as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Do you have any beta tests planned in the near future?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a detailed plan yet. But what we're doing is we are constantly testing through private tests. Every couple of months, we try to iterate the game as quickly as possible. So, I think we can expect further tests in the future,</p>
<p><strong>For fans who may play the MOBA a lot but are not as comfortable or familiar with playing action RPGs, do you have any difficulty or accessibility options for this game?</strong></p>
<p>For now, we are focused on polishing the content. Later on, we should definitely consider that. Even with the mobile version, we must consider a lot of control polishing. I think that's definitely going to be on the radar in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anywhere to sign up or wishlist Honor of Kings: World?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet. We are still working on it. But we'll try our best to bring it to the wishlists as quickly as possible in the future.</p>
<p><strong>When's the next event where players will see more of the game?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know, but we'd love to keep the momentum.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Verdansk came back on April 3, it brought ‘Battle Royale Casual’ with it, an all-new mode packed with bots to give players a much more forgiving experience. Given how I love Call of Duty’s multiplayer platforms but hate sweating against cracked players and the punishing SBMM mechanics, I’m wondering where my ‘Multiplayer Casual’ playlists are.</p>



<p>It’s not an unheard-of concept. In 2022 and 2023, Modern Warfare II and III featured a mode called ‘Invasion’, which was a large-scale multiplayer mode stacked with bots – and it was <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s get some simple playlists sorted out for the less talented player who just wants to chill out and shoot guns.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-struggle">No Struggle</h2>



<p>Before labelling me a crazy person, look at this. I was inspired to explore this topic thanks to a post on <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom/status/1911230593662099703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter by DETONATED</a>, which held a poll that had some <strong>very </strong>telling results:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That post and the subsequent poll got me thinking…</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s skill-based matchmaking mechanics were broken down by their creator during a recent episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>. They’re not as nefarious as you might think, but they’re designed in a way that keeps you on your toes and in lobbies with players around your ‘calculated’ skill level.</p>



<p>It does mean that, at times, you’ll be lumped in with players that walk out of the lobby with a 4.0 K/D.</p>



<p>It was also confirmed a while ago that Call of Duty’s studios <strong>never </strong>inject bots into any multiplayer matches, which is something that other games have done historically. Sure, they’ve mostly been battle royale games with much higher player counts in a single game, but you can downsize the logic, surely.</p>



<p>Invasion was the perfect example of ‘Multiplayer Casual’. It put players in large, sweeping maps with hundreds of bots and a decent array of real players, making it feel like a full-fledged battlefield (no pun or reference intended). It meant that you’d likely end a match with hundreds of kills, and you never had to go looking for enemies.</p>



<p>Invasion was <strong>dropped </strong>coming into Black Ops 6, which left a gaping hole in my rotation.</p>



<p>Here’s my question:</p>



<p>If we can have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a> packed with bots that allows you to experience the same game but earn fewer experience points, why can’t we have a Multiplayer Casual mode that serves the same purpose?</p>



<p>Folks can grind camos, learn the maps, play modes that they usually wouldn’t, experiment with non-meta weapons, and so on, all while avoiding cheaters, punishing SBMM mechanics, and potentially connection issues (if it was entirely a bot lobby, of course).</p>



<p>That poll says that I’m not alone, but I’m just wondering how the logistics of a Multiplayer Casual mode would work.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about this concept in the comments, or join the community over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Meet DMZ: Nuclear Survival, a new PVE and competitive PVP multiplayer open-world survival crafting game set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. It's coming "soon" in early access so that the "brand-new, ambitious, and highly flexible" game can grow alongside its community.</p>
<p>It's thought the game - which hasn't indicated a price, but has at least confirmed it won't be free-to-play - will be in early access for the inaugural year, although that "depends upon development progress and player feedback". You can check it out in the teaser below, which debuted at Indie Live Expo 2025 earlier today:</p>

<p>Developed by a two-person team in Saitama, Japan, DMZ is the debut title from newly formed studio Wild Dog. It takes place on the supercontinent "Pangaea, a "vast, procedurally generated" environment featuring a variety of biomes, including forests, wastelands, deserts, and snowfields. The game's lore suggests it was formed by tectonic shifts caused by the war, where "intense battles for survival" unfolded. Players can excavate ancient ruins scattered across the land - such as pyramids, Terracotta warriors, and Roman temples - and research relics, craft items, and "even resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes to revive a fallen civilization and fight for survival".</p>
<p>You'll also get to capture NPCs and bring them back to base to become companions, each one with a specialty that may come in handy. Non-human recruits like Bears, wolves, and, er, ostriches are also available. Players can also set up shop on dedicated servers to "play with over 100 players", although offline single-player mode is also available.</p>
<p>The duo hope the final version will introduce new biomes and locations, "enhance soldier and NPC development features, improve PvE and PvP mechanics, add craftable technologies, and implement server updates that allow more players to participate simultaneously".</p>
<p>For more, head on over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/">Steam page</a>, which informs me there'll be in-app purchases and full controller support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>However, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live, despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay is already popping up in various corners of the internet</a>. And EA is not happy.</p>
<p>Whilst at first, with mostly positive news leaking, EA seemed pretty content to let the rumours fly, the team is now cracking down on the leaks, saying that no one wins when "information and content [...] is shared out of context".</p>

<p>Global community manager Totalfps hit back at a grumpy reddit thread about purported skill-based-matchmaking, cutting the commenter off with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>"Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way," Totalfps wrote."I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We've long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield."</p>
<p>Totalfps added that "there is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities", but now "is not it", and "the constant reposting of things is not that time or place" yet, either.</p>
<p>"Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to," they said.</p>

<p>"While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community."</p>
<p>Totalfps stressed the Labs program exists because EA "wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again", but it "cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with.

<p>"Rules aren't fun, but they exist to make it better for us all. Thank you to those that are abiding by them, but thank you for your trust and time too to make this great for you - our community," they concluded.</p>
