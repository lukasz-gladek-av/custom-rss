		<p>Having had a great time with the dungeon-crawling digital board gaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">Demeo</a> a few years ago, a sequel was naturally high on my wishlist. That it comes with a full D&amp;D license, as opposed to featuring home brand versions of fantasy staples, just makes Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked all the more exciting.</p>
<p>OK, so the title’s a bit too much, but I can live with that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWXrLKOSmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the heart of Battlemarked is the same style of digital board game adventuring as Demeo. This is a simplified riff on the genres that has you playing attack and ability cards with deterministic outputs, so long as the die rolls in your favour. Additionally, since this is now D&amp;D flavoured, the dice might be 20-sided, but it’s labelled with simple attack markers on all sides, except for a single critical success (doubling damage) and critical failure (whiffing and potentially damaging allies instead).</p>
<p>The cards you have available to you depend on your character, and here we have a hearty bunch of classic D&amp;D classes and races amongst the defined characters. Bolthrax Brightscale is your forthright Dragonborn Paladin, leading the way with his ability to regenerate armour points and soak up damage, allowing Ash the Tiefling Rogue to sneak and stab, while Jessix the Human Ranger marks her quarry and fires arrows from afar, and Tibby the Halfling Sorcerer can send spells of ice and fire to deal elemental damage. There’s two more characters for the full game, and all of them have specific core abilities that will be available all or most turns, and a menagerie of randomised class abilities that can become available to you down the line –&nbsp;Tibby could get a AOE Fireball, for example, Ash a teleporting stab attack that then shrouds her in stealth, and so on.</p>


<p>There’s a good mixture here, and they work well to compliment one another in battle. It’s an easy game to play, gradually revealing the board as you move through the dungeon, kick open doors, and find surprising hordes of enemy goblins, fungal mycopaths, rogue archers and spell-casters, and just swarms of rats. So many rats.</p>
<p>It can be particularly brutal, as each die bounces around on the 3D board scenery and hands down its judgment, with the traditional slew of good and bad luck that would be enough to see you enshrine or melt down your dice in real world D&amp;D. And the randomised levels can be stuffed to the gills with a bunch of hulking trolls to battle one attempt, and more humble opponents on the next.</p>
<p>So far, so Demeo, but Battlemarked embraces the D&amp;D through what’s wrapped around the core dungeon crawling. There’s more storytelling here, and the first of the demo’s two scenarios has one of those traditional D&amp;D campaign openers, as your band of adventurers happens upon a Neverwinter nobleman in dire straits, as he’s attacked by a band of goblins. This wooded scene with a bridge crossing a stream makes for a nice battleground for a bitesized encounter, leading into an opener for the wider campaign narrative, as you’re then invited to escort the nobleman and a late-coming friend back to a tavern in Neverwinter.</p>

<p>You’re also presented with narrative moments, where you can roll actual D20 for skill checks to, perhaps, deceive or intimidate a Myconid guard, give a dexterity check mid-dungeon to avoid a surprise trap, and more.</p>
<p>There’s plenty that’s locked away for the full game, such as character development options and actually getting to visit taverns to pick up side-quests, so the demo gives just a brief but enticing taster of what’s to come. This is also purely flatscreen, with the full game promising PC VR and PSVR 2 support at launch –&nbsp;which I really rather enjoyed for my VR review of this game.</p>

<p>There’s a few knocks to the feature set of the demo that I really hope aren’t issues for the full game, and they mainly come within the settings menu… or the almost total lack of one. Demeo had tons of options for inverting camera controls, button remapping and more, but none of that is present in Battlemarked’s demo. Additionally, there’s no character outlines for characters that are obscured by the scenery, and that’s more problematic with a gamepad, when the zoom and angle is more rigidly fixed. I also wish it was made more abundantly clear that you’ve retrieved the key needed to use the level exit, and which of your characters has it – the icon is just a bit too small.</p>
<p>All in all, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked might have a trickier title to utter than a typical D&amp;D conjuration, but blending Demeo’s moreish dungeon crawling with the trappings of D&amp;D are simply delightful.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gift-this-fun-aragog-in-the-forbidden-forest-lego-set-to-a-harry-potter-fan-without-paying-the-full-price-2000635771</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Halloween is a great time to rewatch the classics like Harry Potter, and what better way to relive your favorite moments than with a fun Lego build? Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets to choose from, but if you’re after something that’s easy to make and doesn’t cost too much, the Aragog in the Forbidden Forest set is a great option to consider.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">It normally runs you around $20, but Amazon is offering it for just $16 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> You’re saving $4 on this budget build that’s fun to work on, and also makes a great gift for any Harry Potter fan out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Your Favorite Scenes to Life</h2>
<p>This set comes with 195 pieces and is appropriate for ages 7 and above. You’re getting Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures with two wands and a lantern to guide them through the forest. You can choose between happy or scared faces, depending on the scene you’re trying to recreate. Though honestly, a scared Weasley feels a lot more fitting than a happy one.</p>
<p>There’s a fairly big Aragog figure, whose legs, fangs, and pedipalps are all movable, so you can create your own dramatic setups. The Aragog figure measures about 2.5 inches high, 6 inches long, and 7 inches wide. Plus, you’ve also got a small buildable forest section with plants, a spider web, and two baby spider figures. There’s a lot of room for creativity, so this set is sure to keep your little ones (or you) engaged for the weekend.</p>



<p>The included instruction manual guides you through the building process step-by-step. If that seems a bit too complicated, you can install the Lego Builder app on your phone. It lets you zoom in on the blocks, rotate your sets in 3D, and track your progress in real time.</p>
<p>If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want to introduce your kids to the wizarding world too, this Lego set is a great way to get started. It’s going to be a fun weekend project, and can also look great as a display piece. If you already own a set or two, place it with the rest of your collection to build your own version of magical adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">This set was already quite affordable at $20, but this deal brings it down to just $16.</a> The discount, however, might not last too long, so we suggest hurrying to grab it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Employees at Electronic Arts (EA) and members of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) have released a statement regarding the pending acquisition and privatization of the company. In the joint statement, union members working at EA state that they weren’t properly represented during sale negotiations and that there is a worry of company layoffs when it happens. </p>



<p>The group says this $55 billion deal will <strong>“further concentrate power and wealth into the hands of a few gatekeepers while doing nothing to address the concerns of players and workers.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“EA is not a struggling company,”</strong> the statement says. <strong>“With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The group says that if any layoffs take place or if studios close, it’s because of a choice to do so and not something done out of necessity. They say that it would be a move done solely to <strong>“pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statement, the <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union has launched a petition</a> for the United States Federal Trade Commission to look more into this deal. They are “calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom.”</p>



<p>The announcement of a deal to sell EA to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in late September</a>. To fund the sale, EA will be taking on $20 billion in debt, which many worry will lead to the aforementioned layoffs.</p>



<p><strong>“Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services.”</strong></p>



<p>The statement closes by saying that the <strong>“value of video games is in their workers” </strong>and that they are <strong>“standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry.”</strong></p>

It is one of multiple games in the works, including the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/12/lucasfilm-games-and-quantic-dream-announce-star-wars-eclipse">2021-announced</a> <em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>, which Cage confirmed is ongoing. <span id="more-1000421"></span></p><p>“This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far,” Cage said. “But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.”</p><p>Here is the full message from Cage:</p><blockquote><p>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling. With award-winning titles like <em>Heavy Rain</em>, <em>Beyond: Two Souls</em>, and <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, more than 25 million players worldwide have shared the journeys of Ethan Mars, Jodie Holmes, Kara, Markus, and Connor, with us.</p><p>Since 2018, we have entered a new phase of growth and innovation. We doubled the size of the team, bringing together talents from all over the world united by the same passion for creativity. We opened a new studio in Montreal, moved into new headquarters in Paris, built the next generation of our proprietary technology, and became our own publisher.</p><p>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to <a title="Genres > Crafting [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.</p><p>We also know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove—which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique.</p><p>Of course, development of <em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank all our fans around the world for playing our games year after year, for their kind words whenever we meet, for their patience and encouragement.</p><p>This is the beginning of a new chapter for Quantic Dream. Thank you for being with us on this journey, we can’t wait to share what comes next.</p><p>—David Cage</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/quantic-dream-developing-multiplayer-title-star-wars-eclipse-development-ongoing]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Quantic Dream is still developing Star Wars: Eclipse, it's assured in a new blog post, alongside development of a new competitive multiplayer game.</p>
<p>The Star Wars game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first revealed in 2021</a>, but in the years since we've seen little of its development. In October 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">development was said to be "simmering"</a>, while earlier this year Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed the studio was not impacted by cuts at NetEase</a> and development continued "at full pace".</p>
<p>Now the studio has shared a <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">new blog post</a> from studio founder David Cage entitled "Writing A New Chapter", in which he provides an update on forthcoming projects.</p>

<p>Since 2018 the company has doubled in size and opened a new studio in Montreal.</p>
<p>"After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step," said Cage. "Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.</p><p>"This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA."</p>
<p>He admitted since the studio has "no legacy in this genre" it has "everything to prove".</p>
<p>Cage then added: "Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, but it does suggest more concrete news is on the way.</p>
<p>After a couple of releases, Quantic Dream found success with PS3 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>, which it later replicated with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-and-quantic-dream-shocked-by-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture">multiple French outlets reported on alleged unhealthy studio culture at Quantic Dream</a>, which was refuted by Fondaumière.</p>
<p>Later, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-defends-response-to-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture-at-quantic-dream-in-new-interview">Cage responded to the allegations</a>. "I don't think we had an aggressive attitude," he said. "When you're accused of things that go against everything you believe in, everything you've done in your life, it hurts. It went beyond just attacking the studio culture."</p>
<p>Lead writer on Star Wars: Eclipse <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">Adam Williams left the studio</a> in 2024 and has since formed a new studio, Republic Games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-director-tomonobu-itagaki-passes-away-at-58.1326451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tomonobu Itagaki, best known for creating the&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>franchise and for the revival of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> as a 3D hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;back in 2004, has died aged 58.</p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1978723327435763751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wario64</a> on social media, Itagaki's Facebook account was updated earlier today with a post which (according to Wario64's machine translation) he asked "someone special" to release when the "light of [his] life is about to run out".</p>

<p>Itagaki says that the fact the post has appeared on his Facebook page "means it's finally time" and that he's "no longer in this world". He says he "stand[s] by [his] beliefs" and has "no regrets", except for "not being able to deliver [his] new work", for which he apologizes to his fans.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-or-alive-tomonobu-itagaki.jpg?itok=DN9rz0p8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-or-alive-tomonobu-itagaki.jpg?itok=pW3r_Dct 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tomonobu Itagaki is best known for the creation of the&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>franchise, as well as the revival of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Itagaki's passing was subsequently <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed by Team Ninja</a>, the studio he founded in 1995, as well as by Itagaki's friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Mielke on Bluesky</a>. No cause of death was announced in any of the places where Itagaki's death was confirmed.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki joined the games industry in 1992, where his inaugural project was the Super Famicom port of sports game&nbsp;<em>Tecmo Super Bowl</em>. What would arguably serve as his big break came in 1996, when he headed up&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>for what was then known as Tecmo Creative #3.</p>

<p>That studio would go on to change its name to Team Ninja, working on the rebooted version of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>for the Xbox back in 2004, as well as subsequent 3D hack-and-slash entries in the revived version of the franchise.</p>

<p>Itagaki departed Team Ninja in 2008 and would go on to work on just two games following his departure, namely 2015's much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Devil's Third&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Samurai Jack: Battle through Time</em>, albeit as an advisor on the second title.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s OptiPlex 7020 Mini PC Falls 71%, From 6× the Price of a Mac Mini to Clearance-Level Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-only-thing-skinnier-than-this-powerhouse-dell-desktop-is-its-71-off-amazon-deal-2000635765</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-optiplex-7020-mini-pc-falls-71-from-6%C3%97-the-price-of-a-mac-mini-to-clearance-level-pricing.1326439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe you’re still unconvinced by the recent wave of mini PCs, but you’re still not willing to plop a full-sized PC tower onto your desk, or even under it. Here’s a massive new Amazon deal on a desktop PC that’s slightly bigger than the other minis, way smaller than the towers, and quite possibly blows them both all of the water when it comes to performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">The skinny Dell Optiplex 7020 is a fat 71% off at just $996.</a></p>
<p>The heart and brains of the Optiplex 7020 is the 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor that delivers enough power to handle all of your productivity tasks and even some creative ones too, and it can do so at sizzling speeds of up to 5.2GHz. There’s also 32GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive inside the slender sub-2-inches-wide body, along with enough ports so it can easily handle being the centerpiece of your home workstation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mini In Name Only</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Optiplex 7020 a “mini PC,” but it’s a weight class or two above the palm-sized PCs that have been all the rage lately. Still, at just 7 inches high and 7 inches long, and just 1.42 inches thick, it definitely qualifies as portable, and can even be mounted on the back of a monitor for ultimate space-saving efficiency. You might have to choose which monitor to mount it behind, though, because the Dell Optiplex 7020 can support up to 3 displays at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, there’s nothing “mini” about the Optiplex 7020, with all of that memory and Intel processing power driving the pre-installed Windows 11 Professional. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 chip will have all three of those 4K monitors looking crisp, if you so choose, in which case you’ll have plenty of visual real estate to put Microsoft Copilot to work as your AI assistant.</p>



<h2>All Your Hookups</h2>
<p>The HDMI 1.4b and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs handle the external monitor situation more than amply, and there are also two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 to satisfy all of your expansion and peripheral needs. The Ethernet RJ-45 port will give you outstanding hardwired internet speed, but it also has Wi-Fi 6 to keep your online work and play moving at a nice clip.</p>
<p>Dell’s foray into the small-PC world originally showed up at Amazon with a bloated $3,399 price tag that we wouldn’t recommend in a million years, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">but with that number slashed down by 71% to just $996</a>, the Optiplex 7020 is a solid buy as a high-powered performance desktop PC that happens to be shrunk down to portable size.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

<p>Team Ninja has just announced that their first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki, has unfortunately passed away. </p>



<p>All eyes are on Team Ninja right now, as their highly anticipated installment to the Ninja Gaiden franchise arrives on October 21, 2025. We have already seen a lot of the game through several trailers and teasers, and it seems that it’s going to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult one</a>. However, less than a week before release, one of the most integral people behind the franchise’s revival has passed away. </p>



<h2 id="h-team-ninja-s-first-leader-passed-away-a-few-days-before-ninja-gaiden-4-s-release">Team Ninja’s First Leader Passed Away a Few Days Before Ninja Gaiden 4’s Release</h2>



<p>Tomonobu Itagaki’s passing was announced through Team Ninja’s <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post stated: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team NINJA’s first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. </p>



<p>We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. </p>



<p>Our deepest condolences for his loss. </p>



<p>From everyone at Team NINJA</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For those unaware, Tomonobu Itagaki is a renowned Japanese video game designer who started his journey at Tecmo in 1992. Itagaki’s claim to success came with 1996’s Dead or Alive. In 2001, Itagaki was named Team Ninja’s first leader, where he revived the 1988 arcade franchise Ninja Gaiden and released it for Xbox in 2004. The title received widespread critical acclaim and an international online tournament. </p>



<p>Following that, the Team Ninja leader helped release Ninja Gaiden Black, Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword, and Ninja Gaiden II. He then left Tecmo in 2008 due to a fallout and founded Vallhalla Game Studios, where he helped develop Devil’s Third with some former Team Ninja members. Then, in 2021, Itagaki created another studio, called Itagaki Games. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-battlefield-6-assault-rifle-loadout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-meta-battlefield-6-assault-rifle-loadout%E2%80%94all-attachments-how-to-unlock-equipment.1326430/</guid>

<p>While Battlefield 6 has a fun and varied arsenal, nothing beats the best assault rifle, and our top meta loadout ensures the weapon has you locked in and will get you more kills than if you used any other AR.</p>



<p>An assault rifle is a staple of online FPS shooters. Sniper Rifles aren’t always applicable, Shotguns also depend on the size of the map, LMGs are powerful but as mobile as a tank, and SMGs also fall into that ‘circumstantial’ territory. An assault rifle is an all-around beast, and even the bad ones are good.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a reliable foundation of assault rifles to kickstart the game, so let’s see which AR is considered to be the meta selection, and we’ll take a deep dive into its best loadout and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Best Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Test it out if you’re unsure. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The consensus is that the M433 is the best meta assault rifle in Battlefield 6, which is no surprise as it’s an extremely effective weapon at most ranges.</strong></p>



<p>Whether you used it in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s campaign or online, the M433 is a monstrous weapon. Everything about it works: Firepower, fire rate, recoil control, its default ammo clip size, mobility, and handling. It’s literally the perfect assault rifle, and it only gets better once you start applying the best attachments to it.</p>







<p>Our best M433 assault rifle class focuses on reducing recoil and making it more efficient and effective during combat. It’s not the most attachments you can have for the gun—so feel free to tinker and add more—but this is a simple and relatively easy to put together loadout.</p>



<p>Here’s our best M433 assault rifle meta loadout.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-m433-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">How To Unlock M433 Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>From the get-go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You’ll be pleased to know that the M433 assault rifle is unlocked by default at the beginning of your Battlefield 6 online multiplayer journey!</strong></p>



<p>It wouldn’t be convenient if all weapons were locked when you start playing Battlefield 6 online, would it? Some guns need to be available, and the M433 is one of them. This means you can equip it right away and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start leveling it up fast and earning XP</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-class-setup-in-battlefield-6">Best Assault Rifle Class Setup In Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>Alongside your M433 assault rifle, you also need the right equipment and abilities. From Frontliner to the M87A1 Shotgun, we’ve picked out the gear you need to complement the M433 perfectly.</p>



<p>Check out each slot and what to put in it:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Field Specs:</strong> Frontliner</li>



<li><strong>Sidearm:</strong> P18 (Pistol)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 1:</strong> M87A1 (Shotgun)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 2:</strong> Deploy Beacon</li>



<li><strong>Throwable:</strong> Fragmentation Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Melee:</strong> Sledgehammer</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Frontliner </strong>is preferable from Field Specs (once you unlock it) as it speeds up health recovery, reduces fall damage, and gives a brief buff to spawning teammates. It’s just a generally great set of abilities that aim to keep you alive for longer and make you stronger.</p>



<p>The <strong>P18 </strong>is the best and most consistent Pistol in Battlefield 6, so that’s an easy one. We’ve opted for the M87A1 shotgun as the first gadget, as that’s the best shotgun in the game. It’s unstoppable, and the perfect option for close-range combat. Whereas the <strong>Deploy Beacon</strong> gets you—and your squad—back into the fray faster.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fragmentation Grenade</strong> is a standard Frag Grenade that’s great for puncturing holes in the walls and enemies, and speaking of both of those things, the <strong>Sledgehammer </strong>is a beastly, bludgeoning no-brainer.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <p>
It's still a little hard to believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> is a thing that exists and is finally here - but here it most definitely is, and developer Team Cherry continues to finesse the experience, with its fourth patch now officially in public beta.
</p>
<p>
Chief among Patch 4's additions is what Team Cherry is calling a "basic implementation" of Silksong's new Simplified Chinese translation - the first step in its efforts to remedy the original translation, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-being-review-bombed-in-china">heavily criticised in a wave of negative Steam reviews</a> back in September.
</p>
<p>
That arrives alongside localisation improvements across a range of languages, further improvements to controller support, and various fixes for a number of highly specific scenarios. Which is to say, you're out of luck if you were hoping Team Cherry might finally look upon you - and your struggles against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-picking-it-up-a-lot-faster-hollow-knight-newcomers-and-veterans-respond-to-the-first-few-hours-of-silksong">Silksong's sometimes punishing difficulty</a> - with benevolent eyes.

<p>
Silksong's public beta patch is available on Steam by selecting Properties &gt; Betas, then opting into the public-beta branch under Beta Participation. Patch notes are below, but Team Cherry says development remains "very much in progress", so expect more fixes ahead of its final release to all players:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation with a new script for public testing. This is a basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback.</li>
<li>Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.</li>
<li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognised. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please visit: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html </li>
<li>Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.</li>
<li>Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.</li>
<li>Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).</li>
<li>Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.</li>
<li>Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.</li>
<li>Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.</li>
<li>Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to Silksong's upcoming fourth patch, Version 1.0.28891 received its full release earlier this week, primarily bringing improved controller support. PlayStation's DualSense Edge controllers are now compatible with Silksong, for instance, and Mac users can expect better compatibility across a range of controllers too. Additionally, the game now automatically pauses if your controller disconnects, meaning you're less likely to spiral into a pit of enraged despair if your batteries suddenly run out in the middle of a boss fight.
</p>
<p>
Full Version 1.0.28891 patch notes for Silksong - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">awarded five gleaming stars in our review</a> earlier this year - can be found below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Dualsense Edge controllers.</li>
<li>Improved support for various controllers on Mac.</li>
<li>Game now pauses when the controller disconnects.</li>
<li>Fixed various smaller controller issues (more fixes to come in future).</li>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition and, in rare cases, having their active quantity reduced by 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Crafting Kits not increasing the damage of offensive blue tools (eg Sawtooth Circlet).</li>
<li>Slight increase to Sharp Dart and Cross Stitch damage.</li>
<li>Updated damage scaling on Rune Rage to match other Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Slight decrease to Thread Storm damage at higher needle levels.</li>
<li>Fixed Surgeon enemies sometimes pulling the hero out of bounds.</li>
<li>Fixed instances of some Spool Fragments being permanently missable if a player immediately quit after collecting the item.</li>
<li>Fixed Crust King Khann sometimes falling out of bounds during entry, when fought on low-end systems.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instance of Second Sentinel becoming rotated when defeated.</li>
<li>Fixed additional case of Seth sometimes getting out of bounds and not returning.</li>
<li>Fixed Seth sometimes remaining invincible for a moment at the start of a refight.</li>
<li>Fixed Vaults slide blocks incorrectly responding to damage sources other than the needle.</li>
<li>Changed Fine Pins wish drops from 50% chance to 100%, but raised required quantity.</li>
<li>Fixed issues when consuming a Silkeater while in water.</li>
<li>Fixed Scuttlebrace sometimes allowing a wall jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft-lock during the Grand Gate opening sequence, if the Citadel had been visited and some bellshrines remained inactive.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Launching in Japan next month</p>

<figure data-uuid="c9f951f7c1376"><a title="Sakurai Manga" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c9f951f7c1376/sakurai-manga.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506461">East Press / Famitsu</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> streams, Direct presentations and more YouTube uploads than we can count, we'd wager that you probably have a pretty good understanding of who Masahiro Sakurai is by this point. But seeing his life story told through a manga? Now that's new (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-manga-based-on-the-life-of-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-out-next-month/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55235">Famitsu</a> has revealed that the legendary creator of <strong>Kirby</strong> and Smash will soon have his very own manga biography, titled "Masahiro Sakurai: Making the World More Fun with Games' (via Google Translate). The book, on which Sakurai has lent a helping hand, traces his life from a childhood passion for gaming, through the creation of Kirby and Sora, and up to the present day. There's even a conclusion that Sakurai himself appears to have written.</p>
<p>According to Famitsu, the manga's six chapters are titled as follows (again, via Translate):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: "Boy Sakurai and Games"</li>
<li>Chapter 2: "The Birth of Kirby of the Stars!"</li>
<li>Chapter 3: "The Beginning of the Great Battle"</li>
<li>Chapter 4: "Sora Limited Company Established!"</li>
<li>Chapter 5: "Inheritance"</li>
<li>Chapter 6: "A Light for the Future"</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will launch in Japan on 18th November for 1,430 yen (roughly £7 / $9), and while an English translation hasn't been announced at the time of writing, Famitsu has revealed a peek at the following three pages:</p>

<p>Sakurai's YouTube channel provided us with an unparalleled look into the developer's mind, so we're not exactly sure what else there is to know. That said, a manga biography wouldn't have made our bingo card any time soon, so it sure is a cool announcement.</p>
<p>The next time we see Sakurai will likely be in his second <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct, which was teased last month. The pink puffball's upcoming racer arrives on Switch 2 on 20th November, so there's only so many weeks left for another info dump from Sakurai himself. Keep those eyes peeled for a Direct announcement!</p>

                <p>Two prominent video game industry veterans have voiced their opinions on AI, with both people--Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield--declaring that AI should not be feared but embraced.</p><p>Kojima, for his part, said AI is already used in a lot of creative work to "come up with ideas." But Kojima himself sees AI "as more of a friend." Kojima said he would use AI to "boost efficiency" but that he himself would continue to "lead the creative part" of game development.</p><p>"I'd like AI to handle the tedious tasks that would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it," he told <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=MWp2Y25jcHV1djZvMA%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired.</a> "I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI."</p><p>Another game developer who talked about AI recently was Schofield, the Dead Space co-creator and Call of Duty veteran. He said at Gamescom Asia this week that he's been tinkering around with generative AI for two years and maintains that it can help "fix" the games industry's issues.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us: It's here to make us better, faster, and more efficient," he said, as reported by <a href="https://x.com/andy_vgc/status/1978676771496063399?s=46&amp;t=KA0eXy1Spm71dnMQdFC23A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "It's a tool."</p><p>Before this, Schofield talked about how "everybody's spouting out about AI" but he's actually doing work with it. "We're always trying to make it cheaper, more efficient, faster, and better," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-and-dead-space-creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>Regarding fears of job losses, Schofield said he's old enough to remember when people thought the emergence of Photoshop and motion-capture technologies would "take jobs away." However, what Schofield said he's observed over the years is that new technologies create more jobs overall.</p><p>Schofield also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">holds the belief</a> that the massive investments into AI companies and technologies could lead to a bubble, and when it bursts, "a lot of smaller AI companies will disappear," but the "strongest systems will remain." This is not unlike the dot-com bubble, when many internet companies scaled back or went out of business, but those left standing thrived and helped shape the internet of today.</p><p>"I don't buy into the idea that AI will permanently take jobs away. Disruption in the short term? Yes. It hurts. But history shows us that every major technological leap creates whole new industries, opportunities, and specialists," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said in a LinkedIn post</a>. "When cell phones appeared, people worried about operators and pay phones. Instead, we ended up with billions of devices, new apps, streaming, and millions of jobs that didn't exist before. The internet, the PC, even the automobile all followed the same pattern."</p><p>The video game industry has undergone mass layoffs recently, with numerous companies slashing jobs.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>

<p>But you have to beat it first</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> already looks incredible, but a new trailer from IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 showcases the awesome feature in which you can actually change key moments from the original story.</p>
<p>You need to beat the game once first, during which you'll experience the story from Judgement Day in its entirety, but once you've done that, you're free to mix things up. Doing so will actually open up new levels and opportunities, so for example, instead of sparing the police that show up at Cyberdyne, you can eviscerate them with a mini-gun. Brutal.</p>
<p>There's also a short clip in which the T-1000 impales Sarah Connor, which is obviously quite a departure from how the original movie plays out. We can't wait to what kind of opportunities this might open up for the rest of the story.</p>
<p>As long as it's executed well and it's not, y'know... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/walking_dead_destinies">The Walking Dead: Destinies</a>, then we're all good.</p>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate recently suffered a delay, but is still scheduled to launch this year on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-turns-your-nintendo-switch-into-a-big-screen-console-for-pocket-change.1326373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch’s built-in screen is fine for quick sessions on the couch, but squinting at that 6.2-inch display during long gaming marathons gets old fast. The <em>MNN</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to an all-time low of $59 on Amazon, down from $89</a>, and it transforms your handheld console into something that feels closer to a proper gaming setup without sacrificing portability.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>What’s especially desirable about the monitor in its own right, is its real plug-and-play ease: The <strong>dual USB-C receptacles let you connect your Switch with one cable</strong> that handles power and video signal simultaneously. Not a distinct power brick in play, no HDMI converter to carry around but one cable from the Switch dock to the monitor.</p>
<h2>Why Size and Portability Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display produces 1920×1080 Full HD resolution</strong> which is an enormous leap from the Switch’s native display at 1280×720. Text becomes crisper, game worlds display more detail and the experience becomes more immersive in general. The IPS panel technology allows for stable colors and<strong> clarity throughout a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you can see the display from the side without the colors washing out or contrast changing. The large viewing angle becomes beneficial in the case that you’re playing with friends huddled around a small table.</p>



<p>The screen’s <strong>matte finish cuts down glare from ceiling lights or windows</strong> which becomes essential in rooms you can’t completely control. Glossy screens are wonderful in lightless rooms but become mirrors in well-lit rooms. The diffusing effect the matte coating gives this MNN monitor prevents the picture from being obscured in well-lit rooms such as coffee houses, air terminal lounges, or sunlit hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Internal speakers reduce one cable and device from your carry-on equipment. Audio quality won’t be the same as with dedicated gaming headsets but the fact that you can have audio without the added hardware makes spontaneous gaming sessions easier. Speakers are loud enough for personal use in quiet spaces and headphones can always be plugged in via your Switch if you want superior audio or prefer the stealth.</p>



<p><strong>HDR support improves compatible games</strong> with increased contrast and wider range of colors. Games developed with HDR in view feature brighter highlights and richer shadows at the same time, and the result is more visual complexity. The contrast becomes particularly apparent in highly lit games such as Breath of the Wild or neo-noir games where atmosphere relies so highly on light and shadow interaction.</p>
<p>The monitor weighs <strong>a little more than two pounds and less than half an inch thick</strong>, so it can fit in laptop bags or backpacks right next to your Switch. The built-in smart cover shields the display in transport and doubles as a stand that tilts the monitor up at a comfortable viewing angle. Since the stand solution is built right in, you’re not searching for something to prop the monitor up against or wrestling with a standalone kickstand accessory.</p>
<p>At $59, this is fantastic value for a transportable display which really enhances your mobile gaming experience.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ego-ai-create-human-like-ai-characters-with-personalities/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98human-like%E2%80%99-ai-characters-with-memories-and-personalities-created-by-ego-ai.1326370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, a San Francisco-based AI company has announced the launch of character.world, an AI engine that allows for the creation of ‘human-like’ characters with memories, personalities, and the ability to form relationships with users.</p>



<p>This technology is built on the Character Context Protocol (CCP), an open-source product from EGO AI, which allows for the seamless integration of powerful and authentic AI-powered NPCs across various games, apps, and platforms, including Discord and Twitch.</p>



<p>The announcement went hand-in-hand with the unveiling of almost $7 million in seed funding to further bolster these AI-driven creations entering the market.</p>



<h2 id="h-living-persistent-characters-who-can-make-games-richer">‘Living, Persistent Characters Who Can Make Games Richer’</h2>



<p>In a press release, the CEO of EGO, Vishnu Hari, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games and digital worlds have always struggled with flat, scripted non-player characters (NPCs) that feel mechanical and forgettable. EGO AI is tackling that head-on with characters who act, react and remember like real players.</p>



<p>Our mission is to move beyond chat windows and give people living, persistent characters who can make games richer, worlds more alive and interactions more meaningful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short video presenting the abilities of EGO AI, the company showcased how a user can talk directly to an AI NPC powered by the CCP technology, getting an instant response that’s contextualized and makes sense. The AI NPC remembered the conversation and referred to it later, even recalling a topic when talking to the user <strong>outside </strong>the initial game.</p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What is ego?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dDGktWqUMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>These are very early days for EGO AI, but investors are excited about the potential. In a statement, Adam Draper of Boost VC, one of the investors in EGO AI, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What excites me about Ego is their approach to one of gaming’s biggest challenges: creating characters that truly feel alive.</p>



<p>Their foundation model is a breakthrough in AI character behavior. We’re entering a new era where AI characters will carry personality, memory, and emotion—indistinguishable from human players—and Ego is positioned to lead it. And Vish is the most resilient founder in the space.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an extensive whitepaper, EGO AI explained everything that goes into the technology driving these AI characters and laid out the benefits, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>More authentic gameplay</li>



<li>Automatic population of game worlds</li>



<li>Automated play and balance testing</li>
</ul>



<p>Each AI character will have a personality, needs, emotions, and memory features that enable them to feel as human as possible, and EGO AI has promised that this is the ground floor for this technology.</p>



<p>It obviously has some concerning elements circulating around it, the most critical of which is the inherent threat to human actors who would otherwise play these roles. This will likely fire up a debate when EGO AI becomes more public.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see more technology like this surface, or would you rather stick to traditional methods of portraying NPCs? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

And each time he’s asked, Zelnick dances around the question, pointing to delivering value for customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding fuel to the scrutiny is the industry's recent jump from $70 to $80 for some games. If Nintendo is charging $80 for Nintendo Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World, and Microsoft, as many expect, jumps to $80 for its games from next year after backtracking on doing just that this year, then it's hard to see GTA 6 priced any cheaper.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans often baulk at the idea of forking out $100 for GTA 6. But according to Chris Stockman, the design director of the first Saints Row game, GTA 6 “deserves” to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esports Insider</a>, Stockman responded to the suggestion that GTA 6 will be the first $100 video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re the only ones that can get away with it, Stockman said. “I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stockman here is saying the sheer scope of GTA 6 will be of a magnitude higher than any video game before it. Certainly it’s rumored to have the largest development budget of all time. Rockstar has barely shown any of the game, so it’s unclear exactly how big and varied an experience it will be. But it seems like a safe bet that barring the worst disaster in video game history, GTA 6 will rewrite the record books when it comes to critical and commercial acclaim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is the world ready for the jump to $100? Earlier this year, a $100 GTA 6 was mooted by Epyllion CEO and analyst Matthew Ball in a <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</u></a>. Near <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>the end of the presentation</u></a>, Ball said that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball wrote. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>Other analysts have poured cold water on the $100 suggestion though</u></a>, saying that such is the huge excitement around GTA 6 that there’s simply no need to limit the game’s potential audience by pricing some out of the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, recently published research claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">if Rockstar were to go with $100 for GTA 6, it would actually cost the company money</a>, with the revenue “sweet spot” remaining $70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price is just one of the many unanswered questions swirling around GTA 6. Another is what Rockstar plans to do with GTA Online. Could the company charge more for access to GTA Online? Will it be a standalone free download? Could Rockstar sell a subscription? Will Rockstar and Take-Two really keep GTA Online available at no additional cost, as before?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully it won’t be long before we get answers. GTA 6 is due out May 26, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You, too, can be Nurse Joy!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon world can feel a bit idyllic at times to imagine, especially when you think of the free universal healthcare via magic healing machines provided to all Pokémon at any Pokémon Center. Since the very first games, these Pokémon Centers have been staffed by a roster of completely identical women (skin, hair, eyes, expression, everything!), all known in the anime as Nurse Joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, for the first time, working Nurse Joys can be a little different.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074504-01k7h8gfppvwt1x8pcq13w39ep-1760445962517.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A introduces unique Nurse Joys at every Pokémon Center for the first time in a Pokémon game. While the first one you're likely to encounter looks like a fairly standard Joy, every woman staffing a Center has slightly different features: different skin tones, different eyes, different mouths, and different eyebrows. They're all still in the same uniform and still sporting the same red loopy pigtails, but they now are giving a lot less pre-1980s Rockette.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074510-01k7h8kvje3ty85f9mg0h8f4gt-1760445973448.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in keeping with one of the features I've really enjoyed about Z-A so far: its character diversity. In past Pokemon games, towns could start to look a little samey, as every character of a single trainer class would have the exact same features copy-pasted. That has started to change in more recent games, but Scarlet and Violet took a bit of a step backward by dressing most of its cast in samey uniforms, again creating the illusion that every character looked the same.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074506-01k7h8haxt6zfk1n7n6s1zb79w-1760445984566.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Z-A, though, not only do NPCs all have different facial features, their outfits can change things up a bit too. You still might see a couple of matching characters here or there, but I've spotted athletes sprinting through town in different colored workout gear, and artists with different colored aprons. It's a small touch, but it adds a lot to the feeling that Lumiose City is actually populated by real people and not a lot of weird clones.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074509-01k7h8jbfn3de0vymx10rezge0-1760445998106.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So congrats to every woman who didn't look exactly like the original Nurse Joy in Pokémon Red and Blue (read: every woman), the job is now open to you, if you want it! Sorry to the gents though, as I still haven't seen any men in the profession. Hopefully next game we can move into the 21st century on that front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week.
